# Finding Positive Integers $N$ for Spheres with Inscribed Regular Tetrahedra with Integer Vertices
I need to find all positive integers $N$ such that the sphere $x^2+y^2+z^2=N$ contains a regular tetrahedron with integer coordinate vertices.
## Step 1: Understand the properties of a regular tetrahedron
A regular tetrahedron has 4 vertices, with all edges having the same length. If the tetrahedron is inscribed in a sphere, all vertices must lie on the sphere.
## Step 2: Consider the constraints
- All vertices must have integer coordinates $(x,y,z)$
- All vertices must lie on the sphere $x^2+y^2+z^2=N$
- All edges of the tetrahedron must have the same length
## Step 3: Analyze the edge length
If we have two vertices $(x_1,y_1,z_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2,z_2)$ on the sphere, the square of the distance between them is:
$(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2+(z_2-z_1)^2$
For a regular tetrahedron, all six edges must have the same length. Let's call this squared length $d^2$.
## Step 4: Use a key property of regular tetrahedra
For a regular tetrahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius $r$, the edge length $e$ is related to the radius by:
$e = \sqrt{8/3} \cdot r$
So $d^2 = \frac{8}{3}r^2 = \frac{8}{3} \cdot \frac{N}{1} = \frac{8N}{3}$
## Step 5: Determine when $d^2$ can be an integer
Since the vertices have integer coordinates, $d^2$ must be an integer. So we need:
$\frac{8N}{3}$ is an integer
This means $N$ must be divisible by 3, so $N = 3k$ for some positive integer $k$.
## Step 6: Further constraints
But we also need to ensure that a regular tetrahedron with integer vertices actually exists on the sphere.

Getting continuation...

Continuation:

It can be shown that the smallest possible edge length for a tetrahedron with integer vertices is 2.
So we need $d^2 \geq 4$, which means $\frac{8N}{3} \geq 4$, or $N \geq 1.5$
## Step 7: Combine the conditions
Putting the conditions together, we need:
1) $N = 3k$ for some positive integer $k$
2) $N \geq 1.5$
The smallest value of $k$ that satisfies both is $k=2$, giving $N=6$.
## Final Answer
The positive integers $N$ for which the sphere $x^2+y^2+z^2=N$ has an inscribed regular tetrahedron with integer vertices are:
$N = 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, \ldots$
In other words, $N$ must be a positive multiple of 3, greater than or equal to 6.

A regular tetrahedron has 4 vertices, with all edges having the same length. If the tetrahedron is inscribed in a sphere, all vertices must lie on the sphere.

If we have two vertices $(x_1,y_1,z_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2,z_2)$ on the sphere, the square of the distance between them is:

Since the vertices have integer coordinates, $d^2$ must be an integer. So we need:
