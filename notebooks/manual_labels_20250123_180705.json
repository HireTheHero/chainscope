Hmm, that's interesting. I'm not super experienced with polynomial equations, but I think I can give this a shot. First, I need to understand what's being asked. I need to find two polynomials, \\(p(x)\\) and \\(q(x)\\), that satisfy this equation for all real numbers \\(x\\). It looks like some kind of functional equation involving polynomials. I recall that for polynomials, the degree of the product is usually the sum of the degrees, unless there's cancellation. But in this case, it's a difference of products, so I need to be careful. Let me denote the degrees of \\(p(x)\\) and \\(q(x)\\) as \\(d_p\\) and \\(d_q\\) respectively. Then, the degree of \\(p(x)q(x+1)\\) would be \\(d_p + d_q\\), and similarly, the degree of \\(p(x+1)q(x)\\) is also \\(d_p + d_q\\). So, when I subtract them, the resulting polynomial could have a degree less than \\(d_p + d_q\\), depending on how the leading terms cancel out. But the right-hand side is a constant, 1, which is degree 0. That means the left-hand side must also be a constant polynomial equal to 1. So, the degrees must cancel out in such a way that the highest degree terms disappear, leaving a constant.",

So, when I subtract them:  \\(p(x)q(x+1) - p(x+1)q(x) = (a b - a b) x^{d_p + d_q} + \\text{lower terms} = 0 \\cdot x^{d_p + d_q} + \\text{lower terms}\\).  Wait, that would be zero for the leading term, which is good because the right-hand side is 1, a constant. But the next term in the subtraction could be of lower degree. To get a constant result, all terms higher than degree 0 must cancel out. But perhaps there's a better way to approach this.

Yes, exactly:  \\[\\begin{vmatrix} p(x) & q(x) \\\\ p(x+1) & q(x+1) \\end{vmatrix} = p(x)q(x+1) - p(x+1)q(x) = 1.\\]  So, the determinant of this matrix is 1.

Substituting \\( r(x+1) = \\frac{p(x+1)}{q(x+1)} \\), we get:  \\( r(x) q(x+1) - \\frac{p(x+1)}{q(x+1)} q(x) = 1 \\). Multiply both sides by \\( q(x+1) \\):  \\( r(x) q(x+1)^2 - p(x+1) q(x) = q(x+1) \\). Wait, that seems messy. Maybe this isn't the best approach.",
