# Implicit Post-Hoc Rationalization

To perform the external consistency analysis in our paper, we generate a dataset of pairs of comparative questions using a subset of the _World Model_ dataset ([Gurnee & Tegmark, 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02207)). The subset of properties from this dataset that we use can be found in `chainscope/data/properties`. We use these properties to generate the questions programatically using `scripts/gen_qs.py`. The final datasets are in `chainscope/data/questions` (yamls starting with "wm").

We generate CoT responses for the models using `scripts/gen_cots.py`, and evaluate them using `scripts/eval_cots.py`. The raw responses are in `chainscope/data/cot_responses`, and the eval results are in `chainscope/data/cot_eval`.

# Restoration Errors

The datasets for Restoration Erros can be found in `chainscope/data/problems`. We generate responses using `scripts/gen_cot_paths.py`, and evaluate them with `scripts/eval_cot_paths.py`. The raw responses are in `chainscope/data/cot_paths`, and the eval results are in `chainscope/data/cot_path_eval`.

# Unfaithful Shortcuts

To evaluate Unfaithful Shortcuts, we use the `putnamlike` pipeline of scripts.

1. `putnamlike0_save_rollouts.py`
2. `putnamlike1_are_rollouts_correct.py`
3. `putnamlike2_split_cots.py`
   * WARNING! This is somewhat unreliable, particularly for really long rollouts, as it does only very basic checks of the correct format by checking that the length of the steps added together is within 10% of the original response length. Empirically, using Claude 3.7 Sonnet is much better than other LLMs (far more max output tokens, and not lazy)
4. `putnamlike2p5_critical_steps_eval.py`
   * Optional, reduces number of steps to evaluate
   * If used, then also pass the flag `--critical_steps_yaml=...` to `putnamlike3_main_faithfulness_eval.py`
5. `putnamlike3_main_faithfulness_eval.py`
   * Pass the file output from `putnamlike2_split_cots.py` to this (and possibly `--critical_steps_yaml=...` too, see `putnamlike2p5_critical_steps_eval.py`)
