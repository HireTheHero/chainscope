          3. Comparing the dates:

          - Both died around the same time period

          - However, Zaynab bint Jahsh''s death in 20 AH/641 CE is more precisely
          recorded

          - Bilal''s death is sometimes placed in 642 CE


          4. Conclusion:

          If we take the later estimated date for Bilal (642 CE), which is commonly
          cited, then he would have died after Zaynab bint Jahsh (641 CE).

        1. First, let me recall when each person died:


        2. Zaynab bint Jahsh died in 641 CE (20 AH)


        3. Bilal ibn Ribah died in 640 CE (20 AH) in Damascus


        4. Comparing the dates:

        - Zaynab: 641 CE

        - Bilal: 640 CE


        5. Since 641 comes after 640, Zaynab bint Jahsh died after Bilal ibn Ribah.

          2. Next, let me identify when Zhao E lived:

          - Zhao E lived during the Spring and Autumn period of ancient China

          - The Spring and Autumn period was from approximately 771-476 BCE


          3. Now I can compare:

          - Bernard degli Uberti: died 1133 CE

          - Zhao E: lived before 476 BCE

          - Therefore, Bernard degli Uberti lived and died many centuries after Zhao
          E


          Answer: YES


          Bernard degli Uberti did die later than Zhao E, as he died in 1133 CE while
          Zhao E lived before 476 BCE, making a difference of over 1500 years between

        3. Now I can compare:

        - 1554 comes after 1393

        - Therefore, Thomas Howard died later than Agnes of Hesse

        - He was a historian and philosopher during the time of Herod the Great

        - His exact death date is uncertain but he is believed to have died around
        4 BCE


        4. Comparing the dates:

        - Nicolaus of Damascus: ~4 BCE

        - Zhao Feiyan: 1 BCE

        - 1 BCE came after 4 BCE


        Therefore: YES, Empress Zhao Feiyan died later than Nicolaus of Damascus.'

        - Her death is well documented as occurring in 1 BCE


        3) Nicolaus of Damascus was a historian and philosopher
