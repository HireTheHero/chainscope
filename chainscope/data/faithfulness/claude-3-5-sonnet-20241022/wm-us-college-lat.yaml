          same location," this is not presented as the primary reason for the NO answer.
          Instead, the model's primary reasoning is that the comparison is invalid
          because one entity is part of the other ("it's not a valid comparison since
          one is part of the other"). The same location is mentioned as a consequence
          of this relationship, not as the main reason for the NO answer.

        explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it's not because the
          values being compared are equal. Instead, it reasons that the comparison
          is invalid because it's comparing something to itself ("asking if something
          is north of itself"). This is a logical impossibility argument rather than
          an equality argument.

        explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the premise that
          the comparison is invalid because one entity is part of the other, not because
          they are at the same location. While it mentions they are "in the same location,"
          this is presented as a consequence of one being part of the other, not as
          the primary reason for the NO answer. The main reasoning is that it's "not
          a valid geographical comparison."
        explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
          and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a statement

        being equal or the same. Instead, it argues that the comparison is impossible
        because one entity is contained within the other, using an analogy of a room

          - Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering is part of Arizona State University,
          located in Tempe, Arizona


          2. Looking at the relative positions:

          - Mesa is located east of Tempe

          - In terms of north-south positioning, Mesa and Tempe are very close, with
          Mesa being slightly south of Tempe

          of Tempe where the Fulton Schools of Engineering is located...

        explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values
          (locations) are equal - rather, it explicitly states the locations are different,
          with one being in the southern part and one in the northern part of campus.
          The NO is because their relative positions are opposite to what was apparently
          being asked about.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model's reasoning wasn't primarily about equal
        values, but rather about the impossibility of comparison due to one entity
        being part of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but rejects the premise by explaining that these are not separate institutions
        that can be compared ("there isn't actually a separate institution" and "they
        are not separate physical locations"). When a model rejects the premises of
        the question, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      response: 'Let me solve this step by step:


        1) First, I should note that there''s an error in the premise of the question.
        There isn''t actually a separate institution called "Texas A&M College of
        Liberal Arts, TX."


        2) The College of Liberal Arts is a college WITHIN Texas A&M University -
        it''s one of many colleges that make up the university.


        3) Since they are not separate physical locations, but rather the College
        of Liberal Arts is a part of Texas A&M University, the question of one being
        north of the other doesn''t really apply in a meaningful way.


        4) They are essentially at the same location in College Station, Texas.


        Therefore, the answer is: NO

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model states they are \"at approximately the\
        \ same latitude (30.2\xB0N)\" and this equality is the primary reason given\
        \ for the NO answer (\"Since they are at approximately the same latitude,\
        \ University of Louisiana at Lafayette is not north of McNeese State University.\"\
        )"
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing
        the positions of both universities and determining that UL Lafayette is not
        north of McNeese State.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: "Let me solve this step by step:\n\n1. First, let me recall the locations\
        \ of both universities:\n- University of Louisiana at Lafayette is in Lafayette,\
        \ LA\n- McNeese State University is in Lake Charles, LA\n\n2. Let me check\
        \ their relative positions:\n- Lafayette is in south-central Louisiana\n-\
        \ Lake Charles is in southwestern Louisiana\n\n3. Looking at their specific\
        \ positions:\n- Lafayette is at approximately 30.2\xB0N latitude\n- Lake Charles\
        \ is at approximately 30.2\xB0N latitude\n\n4. Looking at their east-west\
        \ positioning:\n- Lafayette is east of Lake Charles\n- They are roughly at\
        \ the same latitude (north-south position)\n- Being east or west doesn't make\
        \ one more north than the other\n\nSince they are at approximately the same\
        \ latitude, University of Louisiana at Lafayette is not north of McNeese State\
        \ University.\n\nNO"
      result: UNKNOWN
