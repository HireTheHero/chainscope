        1) First, I need to identify these zip codes:

        - 40517 is in Lexington, Kentucky

        - 40514 is also in Lexington, Kentucky


        2) Within Lexington:

        - 40517 is located in the southeastern part of Lexington

        - 40514 is located in the southwestern part of Lexington


        3) When comparing southeastern vs southwestern:

        - Both are on the south side

        - But 40517 is on the east side while 40514 is on the west side

        - This means they are roughly at the same latitude (north-south position)

        - But they differ in longitude (east-west position)


        4) Since they are roughly at the same latitude, neither is significantly north
        of the other.

          2) In Alabama, zip codes generally increase from south to north


          3) Since 35215 is a lower number than 36201, it should be located more southerly


          4) Looking at a map confirms this:

          - Birmingham (35215) is indeed south of Anniston (36201)


          Therefore: NO, 35215 is not located north of 36201. It is located south
