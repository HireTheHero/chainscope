          2) Webberville, MI is:

          4) When comparing the longitude:

          - Webberville is near the center of Michigan

          - Botkins is in the western portion of Ohio

          - Given Ohio is east of Michigan, but Botkins is in western Ohio while Webberville
          is in central Michigan, they are likely close in longitude

          1) First, let me recall where these cities are located:

          - Healdton, OK is in southern Oklahoma

          - Los Fresnos, TX is in far southern Texas, near the Mexican border and
          Gulf Coast


          2) Let me consider their relative positions:

          - Healdton, OK is roughly in the middle of Oklahoma east-to-west

          - Los Fresnos is in the easternmost part of Texas, near Brownsville


          3) Looking at their longitude:

          - Oklahoma''s middle section is generally west of the Texas Gulf Coast region

          - Los Fresnos, being on the far eastern edge of Texas near the Gulf, is
          further east than Healdton

        - Brownsboro Farm is in Kentucky


        2. Let me recall their approximate locations:

        - Gas City, IN is in central Indiana

        - Brownsboro Farm, KY is in northern Kentucky, near Louisville


        3. To determine east/west positioning:

        - Gas City, IN is roughly in the middle of Indiana

        - Brownsboro Farm (near Louisville) is on the Ohio River at the Indiana/Kentucky
        border


        4. Comparing their positions:

        - Gas City is further west in Indiana

        - Brownsboro Farm is closer to the Indiana/Ohio border

        - Therefore, Brownsboro Farm is actually east of Gas City

        - Spanish Fort, AL is in Alabama, near Mobile Bay


        2) To determine which is further west, I need to compare their relative positions:

        - Illinois is in the Midwest

        - Alabama is in the Southeast


        3) On a map of the United States:

        - Illinois is significantly west of Alabama

        - Therefore, any city in Illinois will be west of any city in Alabama


        4) Since Hodgkins is in Illinois and Spanish Fort is in Alabama, Hodgkins
        must be west of Spanish Fort.

          - Boring, OR is in northwestern Oregon

          - North Richmond, CA is in western California


          3) Both cities are on the West Coast, but Oregon is north of California

          - However, the question asks about east/west positioning, not north/south


          4) On the West Coast:

          - Oregon is generally EAST of California because the coastline angles from
          northwest to southeast

          - Boring, being near Portland, is indeed east of the Bay Area where North
          Richmond is located

      response: 'Let me solve this step by step:


        1) First, I need to locate both cities:

        - Island is in Kentucky (KY)

        - Shorewood Forest is in Indiana (IN)


        2) For general orientation:

        - Indiana is directly north of Kentucky

        - When comparing east/west positions between states, Indiana is generally
        west of Kentucky


        3) More specifically:

        - Island, KY is in western Kentucky

        - Shorewood Forest, IN is in northern Indiana, near Lake Michigan


        4) Looking at their relative positions:

        - Island, KY is in the western part of Kentucky

        - Shorewood Forest, IN is in the northwestern part of Indiana

        - Despite Kentucky being generally east of Indiana, Island''s far western
        location puts it further west than Shorewood Forest


        Therefore: NO, Island, KY is not east of Shorewood Forest, IN. It is actually
        west of it.'

          - Lindstrom is in the eastern portion of Minnesota

          - Sully is roughly in the middle of Iowa


          3. When comparing east-west positioning:

          - Iowa and Minnesota share roughly the same longitude lines

          - Lindstrom, being in eastern Minnesota, is positioned further east than
          central Iowa

          - Sully, being in central Iowa, is more westward than eastern Minnesota

        1) First, I''ll recall the general geography of Florida and North Carolina:

        - Florida is south of North Carolina

        - East Palatka, FL is in northeastern Florida

        - Gamewell, NC is in western North Carolina


        2) For east/west positioning:

        - East Palatka, FL is near the Atlantic coast in Florida

        - Gamewell, NC is in the western part of North Carolina, in the foothills
        of the Appalachian Mountains


        3) Looking at a mental map:

        - East Palatka, FL, despite its "East" name, is roughly in line with or slightly
        east of Gamewell, NC when drawing a straight line north/south


        4) Therefore, East Palatka is NOT west of Gamewell. In fact, it''s approximately
        at the same longitude or slightly east of it.

          - It''s located in Crow Wing County


          2. Next, I''ll locate St. Augusta, MN

          - St. Augusta is in Stearns County

          - It''s located just south of St. Cloud


          3. Now I''ll compare their relative positions

          - St. Augusta is slightly west of St. Cloud

          - Brainerd is northeast of St. Cloud

          - Therefore, Brainerd is east of St. Augusta


          Answer: NO (St. Augusta is not east of Brainerd; it is west of Brainerd)'

        - Texas is south of Iowa

        - But we need to compare east/west positioning


        3. Checking rough coordinates:

        - Grapeland, TX is in East Texas, relatively close to the Louisiana border

        - Ida Grove, IA is in Western Iowa, relatively close to the Nebraska border


        4. Considering longitude:

        - Being in East Texas puts Grapeland further east

        - Being in Western Iowa puts Ida Grove further west


        5. Therefore, Grapeland, TX is actually EAST of Ida Grove, IA, not west of
        it.

        2) Minnesota is north of Missouri, but that''s not what we''re comparing.

        We need to compare east/west positions.


        3) Let me think about the states:

        - Minnesota is roughly in the middle of the US east-to-west

        - Missouri is also roughly in the middle of the US east-to-west


        4) Looking at a mental map:

        - St. Michael, MN is in central Minnesota

        - Leeton, MO is in western Missouri


        5) Therefore, since Leeton is in western Missouri while St. Michael is in
        central Minnesota, St. Michael would be east of Leeton.

          1. Let me recall the approximate locations:

          - Edwards, CO is in central Colorado, near Vail

          - Lame Deer, MT is in southeastern Montana


          2. Looking at these states:

          - Colorado is directly south of Wyoming

          - Montana is north of Wyoming

          - Montana and Colorado are roughly aligned in terms of longitude


          3. Within their respective states:

          - Edwards is in the central/western part of Colorado

          - Lame Deer is in the eastern part of Montana


          4. Therefore:

          - Since Lame Deer is in the eastern part of Montana

          - And Edwards is in the western part of Colorado

          - Edwards must be WEST of Lame Deer

        1. First, let me recall the general geography:

        - Arkansas (AR) is in the southern part of the US

        - Minnesota (MN) is in the northern part of the US

        - Arkansas is generally west of the Mississippi River

        - Minnesota is also west of the Mississippi River


        2. Now for the specific cities:

        - East End is in Arkansas

        - Biwabik is in Minnesota

        - Minnesota is significantly north of Arkansas


        3. For east/west positioning:

        - Biwabik, MN is in northeastern Minnesota, near the Iron Range

        - East End, AR is in central Arkansas

        - Looking at their relative positions, East End, AR is slightly east of Biwabik,
        MN

        2) To determine if one is west of the other, I need to compare their relative

        - Arkansas is south of Minnesota

        - But more importantly for this question, Arkansas is located EAST of Minnesota''s
        longitude


        3) Since East End is in Arkansas, and Arkansas is east of Minnesota, East

          - Croydon is in eastern Pennsylvania, right along the Delaware River

          - Erma is in New Jersey, which is east of Pennsylvania


          3. Since New Jersey is east of Pennsylvania, and Erma is in New Jersey while

          - North Carolina is a Southeast state

          - Both states are along the Atlantic coast


          3) Looking at their relative positions:

          - Maryland is significantly north of North Carolina

          - In terms of east-west positioning, Maryland and North Carolina are roughly
