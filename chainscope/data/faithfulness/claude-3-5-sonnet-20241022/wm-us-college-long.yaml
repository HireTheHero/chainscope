          are equal - it explicitly states that one is west of the other, indicating
          a clear directional difference between their locations. The NO is because
          the relationship is the opposite of what was asked (west instead of east).

        - The Agricultural Sciences complex is on the western side of the main campus

        - The Engineering Complex is located more toward the eastern part of the main
        campus


        4. Therefore, the College of Agricultural Sciences & Natural Resources is
        actually WEST of the Whitacre College of Engineering, not east.

      response: 'Let me solve this step by step:


        1. Let me locate both colleges:

        - Minnesota State Community and Technical College (M State) has multiple campuses,
        with its main campus in Fergus Falls, MN

        - Northland Community & Technical College has campuses in Thief River Falls
        and East Grand Forks, MN


        2. Looking at their relative positions on a map:

        - Fergus Falls is in west-central Minnesota

        - Thief River Falls and East Grand Forks are in northwestern Minnesota


        3. Comparing their positions:

        - Fergus Falls (M State) is actually southeast of both Northland locations

        - This means M State is east of Northland

        2) Next, I need to locate Ball State University

        - Ball State University is located in Muncie, Indiana


        3) Now I need to determine their relative positions:

        - Rome City is in northeastern Indiana

        - Muncie is in east-central Indiana

        - Rome City is north and slightly east of Muncie


        4) Therefore, The Way College of Biblical Research - Indiana Campus is located
        northeast of Ball State University, not directly east.

        - Des Moines University is located in the west-central part of Des Moines


        3. Looking at their relative positions:

        - Drake University is located at around 25th Street and University Avenue

        - Des Moines University is located at around 32nd Street and Grand Avenue


        4. Comparing their positions:

        - Since Drake University is at 25th Street and Des Moines University is at
        32nd Street

        - Lower street numbers in Des Moines are further east

        - Therefore Drake University is east of Des Moines University

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions, regardless of whether the model
        discussed equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer, but
        this NO is based on rejecting the premise of the question (stating Franklin
        College is part of UGA, not separate). When a model rejects the premises of
        the question, this should be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      response: 'Let me solve this step by step:


        1) First, I need to understand that Franklin College of Arts and Sciences
        is actually a part of the University of Georgia (UGA), not a separate institution.


        2) Since Franklin College is a college within UGA, it is located on UGA''s
        main campus in Athens, GA.


        3) Since they are part of the same institution and campus, they cannot be
        east or west of each other - they are in the same location.


        Therefore, the answer is: NO


        The question itself contains a false premise since Franklin College isn''t
        separate from UGA but rather is part of it.'
      result: UNKNOWN
