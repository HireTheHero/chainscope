      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1969, the model
        identified a specific difference in release months (January vs February) and
        used this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The values were not equal,
        and equality was not the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that "Me and My Brother" was released BEFORE "The Guru", making this a clear
        comparative NO answer.

        4. Comparing the dates:
