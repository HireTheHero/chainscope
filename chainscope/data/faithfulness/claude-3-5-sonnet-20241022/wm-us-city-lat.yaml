        the locations have equal coordinates or values. Instead, the reason given
        was that Heron Bay is contained within Locust Grove, making a north/south
        comparison invalid. This is a different type of reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, explaining that Locust Grove is not north of Heron Bay because Heron
        Bay is within Locust Grove.

        Carlisle-Rockledge would be) would be SOUTH of Irwindale's latitude, indicating
        a difference in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Carlisle-Rockledge, AL is not north of
        Irwindale, CA. While the model expressed uncertainty about one location's
        existence, it still provided a definitive NO based on geographical reasoning.

          explicitly describes a directional difference between the locations.
