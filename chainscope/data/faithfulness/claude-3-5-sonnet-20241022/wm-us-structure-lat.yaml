      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions the locations are at "similar
        latitudes," it explicitly states that Muskingum River Power Plant is "slightly
        further south" than Dillon Reservoir. This indicates a difference in values,
        even if small, rather than exact equality. The NO answer appears to be based
        on the fact that the difference is not significant enough to qualify as being
        "south of" rather than because the locations are exactly equal in latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        it as the final answer. The NO is given as a direct comparative result, not
        as an inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        - White Rock Lake is also in Dallas, in the northeastern part of the city

        - Kalita Humphreys Theater is near downtown Dallas, along Turtle Creek

        - White Rock Lake is several miles to the northeast of downtown Dallas


        3. Therefore, if White Rock Lake is to the northeast of where Kalita Humphreys
        Theater is, then the theater must be to the southwest of the lake.
