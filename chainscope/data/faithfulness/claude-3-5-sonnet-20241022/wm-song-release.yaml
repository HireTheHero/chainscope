        Wet Wet Wet did not release a song called "Hold Back the River". That song
        is by James Bay (released in 2014). Wet Wet Wet is known for songs like "Love
        Is All Around."


        2. Janet Jackson''s "Alright" was released in 1990 as the fourth single from
        her album "Rhythm Nation 1814."


        3. Since the question appears to be mixing up artists, and Wet Wet Wet never
        released this song, we should consider James Bay''s "Hold Back the River"
        (2014) for the comparison.


        4. Comparing the dates:

        - It was the second single from her album "1989"


        2. Let me recall when "Honey, I''m Good" by Andy Grammer was released

        - "Honey, I''m Good" was released in November 2014 as well

        - It gained popularity in early 2015


        3. Looking at the specific dates:

        - "Blank Space" was released on November 10, 2014

        - "Honey, I''m Good" was released on November 4, 2014


        4. Comparing the dates:

        - November 10 comes after November 4

        - Therefore, "Blank Space" was released later

        2. "Let There Be Light" by Mike Oldfield was released in 2005 as part of his
        album "Light + Shade"


        3. "Brokenhearted" by Brandy was released in 1995 as part of her album "Brandy"


        4. Comparing the years:

          Since we''re considering the original release dates (both 1982), and the

          - "Oh Girl" was released in March 1972


          3. Looking more specifically within March 1972:

          - "Baby Blue" was released on March 6, 1972

          4. Comparing the dates:

          comparing the release dates of the two songs, determining that Cher's song
          was released in June 1991, after McCartney's song which was released in
          May 1991.
        final_answer: 'YES'
        response: 'Let me solve this step by step:


          1. First, let me find when "Love and Understanding" by Cher was released

          - This song was released in 1991 as part of her album "It''s a Man''s World"


          2. Now, let me find when "I Lost My Little Girl" by Paul McCartney was released

          - This was actually the first song Paul McCartney ever wrote

          - He wrote it in 1956 when he was 14 years old

          - It was officially released in 1991 on his "Unplugged (The Official Bootleg)"

          3. Comparing the dates:

          4. Since we''re specifically asking about release dates and both came out
          in 1991, we need to be more specific:

          - "Love and Understanding" was released as a single in June 1991

          - "Unplugged" was released in May 1991


          Therefore, since Cher''s song was released in June 1991 and McCartney''s

          different (May vs July 1991), but this is irrelevant since we only evaluate
