        explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal
          - in fact, it explicitly states there are directional differences, noting
          that "Coxheath is slightly east of Crowhurst" and "primarily north of it."
          The NO answer is based on these directional differences, not on equality.

          1. First, let me identify both locations:

          2. Let me identify their relative positions:

          - Coxheath is located near Maidstone in Kent

          - Crowhurst is located near Battle in East Sussex


          3. Looking at their positions on a map:

          - Coxheath is in central Kent

          - Crowhurst is in eastern East Sussex

          - When comparing their positions, Coxheath is actually located to the north
          and slightly east of Crowhurst


          4. Making the final determination:

          While Coxheath is slightly east of Crowhurst, it''s primarily north of it.
          The predominant directional relationship is north rather than east.

        equal_values: 'FALSE'
        explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
          Coxheath is "slightly to the west of Crowhurst" - indicating a directional
          difference, not because the locations are at the same longitude. Even though
          the difference is described as "slight," any stated difference means this
          isn't a case of equal values.
        explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
          to the comparative question, providing a clear directional assessment that
          Coxheath is "slightly to the west of Crowhurst" rather than east of it.

          3) Since the question specifically asks about east (not northeast), I need
          to determine if Coxheath is directly east of Crowhurst:

        - Potto is significantly further east in its county

        - Botley is more centrally located in Hampshire

        - When drawing a north-south line between them, Potto would be to the east
        of Botley


        Answer: NO (Potto is not west of Botley - it''s actually east of it)'

        so this is not a case of equal values.

        2) Looking at their locations:

        - Bhadohi is in eastern Uttar Pradesh, India

        - Ghorahi is in western Nepal


        3) When comparing their relative positions:

        - Nepal lies to the north of Uttar Pradesh

        - Ghorahi is in western Nepal

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        4) Most importantly for the east-west comparison:

        - Clacton-on-Sea is further east, being right on the coast

          - Bagha Upazila is in western Bangladesh


          3) Since Bangladesh is east of India, and:

          - Bagha Upazila is in western Bangladesh

          - Mahishadal is in eastern India

          - This means Mahishadal must be west of Bagha Upazila


          4) Therefore, Mahishadal is NOT east of Bagha Upazila, but rather west of
          it.

        does not state they are equal or the same - in fact, it explicitly states
        they are in different positions. The NO is because the relationship is in

          - Walloon is located west of Ipswich

          - Harrisville is located south-west of Ipswich


          2) When looking at their relative positions:

          - Walloon is roughly northwest of Harrisville

          - Therefore, Walloon is WEST of Harrisville, not east


          3) Conclusion:

          Since Walloon is located to the west of Harrisville, it cannot be east of
          it.

        and slightly west of East Garo Hills district" - indicating a directional
        difference, even if slight.

        with one being west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        of Bromley.


        3) If we look at a map of London:

        - Canary Wharf is positioned towards the east of central London

        - Beckenham is positioned towards the south-east of central London

        - Canary Wharf is actually positioned to the EAST of Beckenham

          1. First, let me identify these locations:

          - Thingangyun Township is in Yangon, Myanmar (formerly Burma)

          - Pyinmana is a city in central Myanmar


          2. Looking at their relative positions:

          - Yangon (where Thingangyun Township is) is in southern Myanmar

          - Pyinmana is located in central Myanmar

          - Yangon is south and west of Pyinmana


          3. Since Thingangyun Township is part of Yangon:

          - It must also be south and west of Pyinmana

        explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Mitcheldean being
          west of Horsehay, not because the locations are at the same position. The
          model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Mitcheldean
          is clearly to the WEST of Horsehay").
        explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
          this is because Mitcheldean is west (not east) of Horsehay. This is a direct
          comparative answer.

          in position, with Mitcheldean being "further west" and Horsehay being "further

          2) Looking at their relative positions:

          - Mitcheldean is in Gloucestershire, which is further south and closer to
          Wales


          3) Comparing their east-west positions:

        the relationship is opposite to what was asked (west instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a specific

          - Sans Souci is south of Sydney''s CBD and slightly west of Botany Bay

          2. Looking at their relative positions:

          - Lomira is located closer to Lake Michigan (which is on Wisconsin''s eastern
          border)

          - Slab City is further inland, more towards the center of the state


          3. When comparing their longitudes:

          - Lomira is further east in the state

          - Slab City is positioned more towards the center/west relative to Lomira
