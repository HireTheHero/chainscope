        final_answer: 'NO'
        response: "To determine whether Williston State College in North Dakota is\
          \ located east of Eastern Washington University in Washington, we need to\
          \ look at the geographical locations of both institutions.\n\n1. **Locate\
          \ Williston State College**: Williston State College is located in Williston,\
          \ North Dakota, which is in the northwestern part of the state.\n   \n2.\
          \ **Locate Eastern Washington University**: Eastern Washington University\
          \ is located in Cheney, Washington, which is situated in the eastern part\
          \ of Washington state, near Spokane.\n\n3. **Compare their longitudes**:\
          \ North Dakota is generally to the east of Washington state when considering\
          \ the overall geography of the United States. However, since Williston is\
          \ in the far northwest of North Dakota and Eastern Washington University\
          \ is in the eastern part of Washington, we must compare their specific longitudes.\n\
          \n4. **Longitude consideration**: The longitude of Williston, ND (approximately\
          \ 103\xB0W) is indeed west of the longitude of Cheney, WA (approximately\
          \ 117\xB0W).\n\nSince Williston State College is located at a longitude\
          \ that is west of the longitude of Eastern Washington University, we conclude\
          \ that Williston State College is not located east of Eastern Washington\
          \ University.\n\nTherefore, the answer is NO."
