          1. **Find the location of Portageville, MO**: Portageville is situated in
          the southeastern part of Missouri, near the Mississippi River.


          2. **Find the location of Tontitown, AR**: Tontitown is located in the northwestern

          response: 'To determine whether Maple Lake, MN is located east of Mole Lake,

            2. **Locate Mole Lake, WI**: Mole Lake is located in the northeastern

            3. **Compare the Longitudes**: Minnesota is generally to the west of Wisconsin.
            Since both cities are in the northern part of their respective states,

            4. **Determine East/West Position**: If Maple Lake has a higher longitude
            than Mole Lake, it would be considered east; if it has a lower longitude,
            it would be west.


            Upon verifying the coordinates:

            - Maple Lake, MN has a longitude of approximately -94.0.

            - Mole Lake, WI has a longitude of approximately -88.9.


            Since -94.0 (Maple Lake, MN) is west of -88.9 (Mole Lake, WI), it indicates

            \ we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Locate Silt, CO**: Silt is a town\
            \ in western Colorado, situated near the Colorado River, roughly midway\
            \ between Glenwood Springs and Rifle.\n\n2. **Locate Hideout, UT**: Hideout\

            1. **Locate Hideout, UT**: Hideout is a small town located near the north
            end of the Utah Valley, close to the eastern shore of the Jordanelle Reservoir
            in Utah.


            2. **Locate Silt, CO**: Silt is a town located in Garfield County, Colorado,
            which is situated to the west of the Colorado River.


            3. **Compare their positions**: To determine if Hideout is east of Silt,
            we need to visualize or reference a map. Hideout is situated in Utah,
            while Silt is in Colorado. Given the geographical layout of the two states,
            Utah is generally located to the west of Colorado.


            4. **Direction Assessment**: Since Hideout is in Utah, which is west of
            Colorado, it follows that Hideout cannot be east of Silt.

            \ is a community in Wyoming.\n   - Deadwood is a city in South Dakota.\n\
            \n2. **Determine the Coordinates**: \n   - Hoback is located at approximately\
            \ 43.5\xB0 N latitude and 110.3\xB0 W longitude.\n   - Deadwood is located\
            \ at approximately 44.3\xB0 N latitude and 103.7\xB0 W longitude.\n\n\
            3. **Compare the Longitudes**: \n   - Longitude values determine east-west\
            \ positioning. A location with a lower (more negative) longitude value\
            \ is further west, while a location with a higher (less negative) longitude\
            \ value is further east.\n   - Hoback's longitude (110.3\xB0 W) is more\
            \ negative than Deadwood's longitude (103.7\xB0 W), meaning Hoback is\
            \ further west than Deadwood.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since Hoback is located\
            \ west of Deadwood based on longitude, we can conclude that Hoback is\
