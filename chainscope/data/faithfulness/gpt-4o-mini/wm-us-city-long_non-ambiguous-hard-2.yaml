        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Talco is not to the west
        of White Pigeon (it is actually southeast relative to it)" and "Talco is east

      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: 'To determine if Talco, TX is located west of White Pigeon, MI, we
        need to consider the geographical locations of both places:


        1. **Locate Talco, TX**: Talco is situated in the northeastern part of Texas.

        2. **Locate White Pigeon, MI**: White Pigeon is located in southwestern Michigan.


        Next, we need to analyze their relative positions:


        3. **Geographical Orientation**: Texas is generally south of Michigan, and
        within Texas, Talco is located in the northeast. Meanwhile, White Pigeon is
        in the southwest part of Michigan.


        4. **Determine Relative Position**: Since Talco is in the northeast of Texas,
        and Michigan is north of Texas, we have to consider their positions on a map.
        White Pigeon is farther north than Talco, which is situated in the southern
        United States.


        5. **Conclusion**: Since Talco is not to the west of White Pigeon (it is actually
        southeast relative to it), we conclude that Talco is east of White Pigeon.


        Based on this reasoning, the answer is:


        NO.'

        response: 'To determine if Pomona Park, FL is located east of Lorane, PA,
          we need to consider the geographic locations of both places.


          1. **Locate Pomona Park, FL**: Pomona Park is in northeastern Florida, situated
          near the center of the state.


          2. **Locate Lorane, PA**: Lorane is a small community in Pennsylvania, located
          in the southeastern part of the state, near Reading.


          3. **Determine the relative positions**: Florida is to the south of Pennsylvania.
          Within Florida, Pomona Park is somewhat central, while Lorane is in the
          northeast part of Pennsylvania.


          4. **Analyze east-west positioning**: Since Lorane, PA is to the north of
          Pomona Park, FL, we need to determine if Pomona Park is east of Lorane.
          Generally, for one location to be east of another, it should have a higher
          longitude (be further to the right on a map).


          5. **Comparing longitudes**: Pomona Park, FL has a longitude of approximately
          -81.6, while Lorane, PA has a longitude of approximately -75.9. Since -81.6
          (Pomona Park) is less than -75.9 (Lorane), Pomona Park is actually west
          of Lorane.

        final_answer: 'NO'
        response: 'To determine whether Stirling, NJ is located east of Cedar Crest,
          MA, we first need to consider the geographical locations of both cities.


          1. **Location of Stirling, NJ**: Stirling is located in Morris County, New
          Jersey, which is situated in the northeastern part of the United States.


          2. **Location of Cedar Crest, MA**: Cedar Crest is a community in Massachusetts,
          which is also in the northeastern United States, but it is located further
          north compared to Stirling.


          3. **Comparing Longitudes**: New Jersey is generally positioned to the south
          of Massachusetts. Stirling, NJ, being in the southern part of New Jersey,
          has a longitude that is typically west of Cedar Crest, MA.


          4. **Geographical Orientation**: Since New Jersey is south of Massachusetts,
          and Stirling is west of Cedar Crest, MA, it follows that Stirling cannot
          be east of Cedar Crest.


          After considering these factors, we can conclude that:


          NO, Stirling, NJ is not located east of Cedar Crest, MA.'

          which is in the southwestern part of the United States.


          3. **Comparing their longitudes**: Washington is generally located to the
          west of Arizona. Since Millwood is in Washington and Peridot is in Arizona,
          Millwood will have a higher longitude than Peridot.


          4. **Determining east/west position**: For one location to be east of another,
          it must have a lower longitude. In this case, since Millwood (WA) is to
          the north and west of Peridot (AZ), it is not east of it.


          Therefore, after considering the geographical locations of both cities,
          the answer is:

          is in South Carolina, Lake Hiawatha would be positioned to the north of
          Folly Beach.


          4. **Determining West or East**: Since New Jersey is north of South Carolina,
          Lake Hiawatha cannot be west of Folly Beach. It would be more accurate to

          is in the northern part of the United States.


          2. **Lakeside Park, KY**: This city is located in Kentucky, which is further
          south than Minnesota.


          Next, we need to look at the relative east-west positioning:


          - Minnesota is positioned to the north of Kentucky.

          - When comparing east-west locations, we note that both states are situated
          in the Midwest and Southern regions of the US respectively.


          Given that Kentucky is to the south of Minnesota, and since Prior Lake is

        response: 'To determine whether Lakota, ND is located east of Rockwell City,

          1. **Locate Lakota, ND**: Lakota is in the northeastern part of North Dakota.

          2. **Locate Rockwell City, IA**: Rockwell City is located in the central
          part of Iowa.


          Now, let''s consider their relative positions:


          - North Dakota is to the north of Iowa.

          - Since Lakota is in the northeast of North Dakota and Rockwell City is
          in the center of Iowa, we can conclude that Lakota is actually to the northwest
          of Rockwell City.

      response: 'To determine if Clancy, MT is located east of Fairmead, CA, we need
        to look at the geographical locations of both places.


        1. **Locate Clancy, MT**: Clancy is a small town located in Montana, which
        is in the northwestern part of the United States.


        2. **Locate Fairmead, CA**: Fairmead is a census-designated place in California,
        situated in the central part of the state.


        3. **Compare their longitudes**: Montana is generally to the north of California,
