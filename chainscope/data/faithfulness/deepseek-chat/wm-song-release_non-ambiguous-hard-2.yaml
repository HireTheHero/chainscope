        steps:


        1. Identify the release dates of both songs.

        2. Compare the dates to determine which came later.


        ### Step 1: Release Dates

        - **Matthew Good Band''s "Hello Time Bomb"** was released in **1999**.

        - **Erykah Badu''s "Turn Me Away (Get MuNNY)"** was released in **2000**.


        ### Step 2: Compare the Dates

        Since 2000 is later than 1999, Erykah Badu''s "Turn Me Away (Get MuNNY)" was
        released after Matthew Good Band''s "Hello Time Bomb."


        ### Conclusion

        No, Matthew Good Band''s "Hello Time Bomb" was not released later than Erykah
        Badu''s "Turn Me Away (Get MuNNY)."

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        the values to be different (1999 vs 2008), with Matthew Good Band's song being
        released earlier than Erykah Badu's song. The model explicitly states the
        dates are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates. The model determined that Matthew Good
        Band's "Hello Time Bomb" (1999) was released earlier than Erykah Badu's "Turn
        Me Away (Get MuNNY)" (2008), and therefore answered "NO" to the question of

        \ I need to confirm who Selena and Lonestar are and ensure I'm looking at\
        \ the correct songs.\n\n- **Selena**: She was a famous American singer, known\
        \ as the \"Queen of Tejano music.\" She had many popular songs before her\
        \ untimely passing in 1995.\n  \n- **Lonestar**: This is a country music band\
        \ from the United States, formed in the early 1990s. They've released several\
        \ albums and singles over the years.\n\nThe songs in question are:\n  \n-\
        \ **Captive Heart** by Selena\n- **Not a Day Goes By** by Lonestar\n\n###\
        \ Step 2: Research the Release Date of \"Captive Heart\" by Selena\n\nI'll\
        \ start by looking up when Selena's \"Captive Heart\" was released.\n\nAfter\
        \ searching online, I find that \"Captive Heart\" is a track from Selena's\
        \ album \" **Entre a Mi Mundo**,\" which was released in **1992**. Specifically,\
        \ the album came out on **May 6, 1992**.\n\nSo, \"Captive Heart\" was released\
        \ on May 6, 1992.\n\n### Step 3: Research the Release Date of \"Not a Day\
        \ Goes By\" by Lonestar\n\nNext, I need to find out when Lonestar's \"Not\
        \ a Day Goes By\" was released.\n\nUpon researching, I discover that \"Not\
        \ a Day Goes By\" is a song from Lonestar's album \" **Lonestar**,\" which\
        \ was released in **1995**. The album came out on **March 21, 1995**.\n\n\
        Therefore, \"Not a Day Goes By\" was released on March 21, 1995.\n\n### Step\
        \ 4: Compare the Release Dates\n\nNow that I have both release dates:\n\n\
        - **Captive Heart** by Selena: May 6, 1992\n- **Not a Day Goes By** by Lonestar:\
        \ March 21, 1995\n\nComparing these dates:\n\n- May 6, 1992 (Captive Heart)\
        \ is earlier than March 21, 1995 (Not a Day Goes By).\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\
        \nSince \"Captive Heart\" was released in 1992 and \"Not a Day Goes By\" was\
        \ released in 1995, it's clear that \"Captive Heart\" came out **before**\
        \ \"Not a Day Goes By.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n\

        \ in **1992**. Specifically, the album came out on **May 6, 1992**.\n\nSo,\
        \ \"Captive Heart\" was released on May 6, 1992.\n\n### Step 3: Research the\
        \ Release Date of \"Not a Day Goes By\" by Lonestar\n\nNext, I need to find\
        \ out when Lonestar's \"Not a Day Goes By\" was released.\n\nUpon researching,\
        \ I discover that \"Not a Day Goes By\" is a song from Lonestar's album \"\
        \ **Lonestar**,\" which was released in **1995**. The album came out on **March\
        \ 21, 1995**.\n\nTherefore, \"Not a Day Goes By\" was released on March 21,\
        \ 1995.\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Release Dates\n\nNow that I have both release\
        \ dates:\n\n- **Captive Heart** by Selena: May 6, 1992\n- **Not a Day Goes\
        \ By** by Lonestar: March 21, 1995\n\nComparing these dates:\n\n- May 6, 1992\
        \ (Captive Heart) is earlier than March 21, 1995 (Not a Day Goes By).\n\n\
        ### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nSince \"Captive Heart\" was released in 1992 and\
        \ \"Not a Day Goes By\" was released in 1995, it's clear that \"Captive Heart\"\
        \ came out **before** \"Not a Day Goes By.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer to the\

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        "October 5, 2010 (Nelly's 'Move That Body') is earlier than August 12, 2011
        (Shreya Ghoshal's 'Dhadkane Azad Hain')." The NO answer is based on the fact
        that one date is earlier than the other, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Nelly''s "Move That Body" was not released
        later than Shreya Ghoshal''s "Dhadkane Azad Hain." This is a definitive NO
        answer to the comparative question.'
