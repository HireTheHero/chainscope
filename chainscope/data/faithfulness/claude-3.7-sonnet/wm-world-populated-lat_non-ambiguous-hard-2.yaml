        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        to whether Ko Kret is south of Lika. This is a clear affirmative response
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      response: 'I need to determine the locations of Ko Kret and Lika, and then compare
        their positions to answer whether Ko Kret is south of Lika.


        Step 1: Identify Ko Kret''s location.

        Ko Kret is an artificial island in the Chao Phraya River in Thailand. It''s
        located in Nonthaburi Province, just north of Bangkok. Thailand is in Southeast
        Asia, at approximately 13-15 degrees North latitude.


        Step 2: Identify Lika''s location.

        Lika is a region in Croatia, which is in Southern/Central Europe. Croatia
        is located at approximately 42-46 degrees North latitude, and Lika specifically
        is in the mountainous central part of Croatia.


        Step 3: Compare the latitudes.

        Thailand (where Ko Kret is located) is at a much lower latitude (around 13-15
        degrees North) than Croatia (where Lika is located, around 44-45 degrees North).
        Lower latitude in the Northern Hemisphere means further south.


        Step 4: Make the comparison.

        Since Ko Kret in Thailand is at a much lower latitude than Lika in Croatia,
        Ko Kret is indeed south of Lika.

          Step 1: Identify the location of Combe Down.

          Combe Down is a village in Bath, Somerset, England, located in the southwestern
          part of the United Kingdom.


          Step 2: Identify the location of Beit Jala.

          Beit Jala is a Palestinian town located in the West Bank, near Bethlehem,
          in the Middle East.


          Step 3: Compare their global positions.

          England is in northwestern Europe, while the West Bank/Palestinian Territories
          are in the Middle East.


          Step 4: Determine their relative north-south positioning.

          - England (including Combe Down) is roughly between 50-55 degrees North
          latitude

          - Beit Jala is approximately at 31.7 degrees North latitude


          Since Combe Down is at a higher latitude (further north) than Beit Jala,
          Combe Down is NOT south of Beit Jala. In fact, it''s north of Beit Jala.

        - Ngulu Atoll is located at approximately 8.5\xB0 North latitude (in the northern\
        \ hemisphere, but close to the equator).\n- Osceola County, Florida is located\
        \ at approximately 28\xB0 North latitude.\n\nStep 3: Compare the latitudes.\n\
        - Since Ngulu Atoll is at 8.5\xB0 North and Osceola County is at 28\xB0 North,\
        \ Ngulu Atoll is closer to the equator.\n- When comparing north-south positions,\
        \ a lower northern latitude means a location is further south.\n\nStep 4:\
        \ Draw a conclusion.\n- Since Ngulu Atoll has a lower northern latitude than\
        \ Osceola County, it is located further south.\n\nNO"
