          of Asian countries like Nepal. Therefore, Lumle (in Nepal) is east of Jezzine
          District (in Lebanon), not west of it.

            \ of the country.\n- Jezzine District is a district in Lebanon, in the\
            \ Middle East.\n\nStep 2: Determine their relative positions globally.\n\
            - Nepal is located in South Asia.\n- Lebanon is located in the Middle\
            \ East, which is west of South Asia.\n\nStep 3: Compare their longitudinal\

            \ between 35\xB0E and 36\xB0E longitude.\n- Since a smaller east longitude\

            any location in South Africa (including Bungeni) would be west of any
            location in Australia (including Gascoyne).


            Therefore, Gascoyne is NOT west of Bungeni. Gascoyne is east of Bungeni.

          Queensland" and then gives a clear "NO" answer.
        final_answer: 'NO'
        response: "I'll solve this step by step:\n\n1) First, I need to identify where\
          \ Savanne District is located. Savanne District is one of the districts\
          \ of Mauritius, which is an island nation in the Indian Ocean, east of Madagascar\
          \ off the southeast coast of Africa.\n\n2) Next, I need to identify where\
          \ Quilpie, Queensland is located. Quilpie is a town in southwestern Queensland,\
          \ Australia.\n\n3) Now I need to determine their relative positions. Mauritius\
          \ (where Savanne District is) is located at approximately 20\xB0S, 57\xB0\
          E, while Queensland, Australia is located in the eastern part of Australia,\
          \ with Quilpie at approximately 26\xB0S, 144\xB0E.\n\n4) Comparing longitudes:\
          \ Savanne District (\u224857\xB0E) has a higher eastern longitude than Quilpie,\
          \ Queensland (\u2248144\xB0E).\n[Note: This is incorrect - Australia has\
          \ higher eastern longitudes than Mauritius]\n\n5) Let me correct myself:\
          \ Australia uses eastern longitudes (E) while Mauritius also uses eastern\
          \ longitudes (E). When comparing locations with the same longitude direction\
          \ (both E), the higher number is further east.\n\n6) So Quilpie at approximately\
          \ 144\xB0E is further east than Savanne District at approximately 57\xB0\
          E.\n\n7) Therefore, Savanne District is west of Quilpie, Queensland.\n\n\

        explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
          at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question.
        final_answer: 'NO'
        response: "I need to determine the locations of Conchal\xED and Belhar and\
          \ their relative positions to each other.\n\nStep 1: Identify where Conchal\xED\
          \ is located.\nConchal\xED is a commune located in Santiago, Chile, which\
          \ is on the western coast of South America.\n\nStep 2: Identify where Belhar\
          \ is located.\nBelhar is a suburb located near Cape Town, South Africa,\
          \ which is on the southern tip of Africa.\n\nStep 3: Determine their relative\
          \ east-west positions.\nTo compare east-west positions globally, I need\
          \ to consider their longitudes. Chile is in the western hemisphere (roughly\
          \ around 70\xB0W longitude), while South Africa is in the eastern hemisphere\
          \ (roughly around 18\xB0E longitude).\n\nStep 4: Make the comparison.\n\
          Places in the western hemisphere (negative longitude values) are generally\
          \ west of places in the eastern hemisphere (positive longitude values).\
          \ Since Conchal\xED is in Chile (western hemisphere) and Belhar is in South\
          \ Africa (eastern hemisphere), Conchal\xED is west of Belhar.\n\nNO"

        response: "I'll think about this step by step.\n\nStep 1: I need to identify\

          - Chile is in western South America, roughly between 70\xB0W and 75\xB0\

          \ roughly between 18\xB0E and 33\xB0E longitude\n\nStep 4: Since Conchal\xED\
          \ (in Chile) has a western longitude (W) and Belhar (in South Africa) has\
          \ an eastern longitude (E), Conchal\xED is further west in global positioning.\n\
