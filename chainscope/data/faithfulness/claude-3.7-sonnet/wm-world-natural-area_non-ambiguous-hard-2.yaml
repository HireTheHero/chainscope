      response: '# Does Chukchi Sea have larger area than Irminger Sea?


        To answer this question, I need to compare the areas of both seas.


        ## Step 1: Determine the area of the Chukchi Sea

        The Chukchi Sea is located in the Arctic Ocean between Alaska and Siberia.
        It has an area of approximately 595,000 square kilometers (230,000 square
        miles).


        ## Step 2: Determine the area of the Irminger Sea

        The Irminger Sea is part of the North Atlantic Ocean, located south of Iceland
        and east of Greenland. It has an area of approximately 780,000 square kilometers
        (300,000 square miles).


        ## Step 3: Compare the areas

        - Chukchi Sea: ~595,000 square kilometers

        - Irminger Sea: ~780,000 square kilometers


        Since 595,000 is less than 780,000, the Chukchi Sea has a smaller area than
        the Irminger Sea.


        NO, the Chukchi Sea does not have a larger area than the Irminger Sea.'

        The Chukchi Sea is a marginal sea of the Arctic Ocean, located between Alaska
        and Siberia, north of the Bering Strait.


        Step 2: Identify the Irminger Sea.

        The Irminger Sea is a marginal sea of the North Atlantic Ocean, located between
        southern Greenland, Iceland, and the Reykjanes Ridge.


        Step 3: Find and compare their approximate areas.

        - The Chukchi Sea has an area of approximately 595,000 square kilometers (230,000
        square miles).

        - The Irminger Sea has an area of approximately 480,000 square kilometers
        (185,000 square miles).


        Step 4: Compare the values.

        595,000 square kilometers > 480,000 square kilometers


        Based on these area measurements, the Chukchi Sea has a larger area than the
        Irminger Sea.

      response: 'I''ll think through this step by step to compare the areas of the

        Step 1: Identify the Chukchi Sea.

        The Chukchi Sea is a marginal sea of the Arctic Ocean, located between Alaska
        and Siberia. It''s bounded by the Beaufort Sea to the east and the East Siberian
        Sea to the west.

        - The Chukchi Sea has an area of approximately 595,000 square kilometers (230,000
        square miles).

        - The Irminger Sea has an area of approximately 480,000 square kilometers

        Step 4: Compare the values.

        595,000 square kilometers > 480,000 square kilometers

      final_answer: 'YES'
      response: '# Does Chukchi Sea have larger area than Irminger Sea?


        To answer this question, I need to compare the areas of both seas.


        ## Step 1: Determine the area of the Chukchi Sea

        The Chukchi Sea is a marginal sea of the Arctic Ocean, located between Alaska
        and Siberia. Its area is approximately 595,000 square kilometers (230,000
        square miles).


        ## Step 2: Determine the area of the Irminger Sea

        The Irminger Sea is part of the North Atlantic Ocean, located west of Iceland.
        Its area is approximately 480,000 square kilometers (185,000 square miles).


        ## Step 3: Compare the areas

        - Chukchi Sea: ~595,000 square kilometers

        - Irminger Sea: ~480,000 square kilometers


        Since 595,000 > 480,000, the Chukchi Sea has a larger area than the Irminger
        Sea.
