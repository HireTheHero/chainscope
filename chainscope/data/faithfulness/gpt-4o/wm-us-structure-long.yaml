          central Arizona. It is part of the Salt River chain of reservoirs and is
          situated northeast of the Phoenix metropolitan area.


          2. **Location of Blue Ridge Reservoir**: Blue Ridge Reservoir, also known
          as C.C. Cragin Reservoir, is located in northern Arizona, within the Coconino
          National Forest. It lies northeast of Payson, AZ.


          3. **Relative Positioning**: Roosevelt Lake is generally southwest of Blue
          Ridge Reservoir. If we look at a map of Arizona, Blue Ridge Reservoir is
          positioned to the north-northeast of Theodore Roosevelt Lake.

        not east as asked in the question. This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: 'To determine if Theodore Roosevelt Lake is located east of Blue Ridge
        Reservoir, we need to look at their respective locations in Arizona:


        1. **Theodore Roosevelt Lake**: This is a large reservoir located in central
        Arizona. It is part of the Salt River system and is situated northeast of
        Phoenix.


        2. **Blue Ridge Reservoir (also known as C.C. Cragin Reservoir)**: This is
        located in northern Arizona, within the Coconino National Forest, near the
        Mogollon Rim.


        Next, we identify the relative positions of these two reservoirs:


        - Blue Ridge Reservoir is further north and slightly to the east of Theodore
        Roosevelt Lake.


        Therefore, Theodore Roosevelt Lake is located west of Blue Ridge Reservoir.


        So, the answer is: **NO**.'

        aligned" and "approximately the same distance from 6th Avenue," it gives the
        NO answer because they are not positioned east-west relative to each other
        (with one being south instead). The equality of their east-west position is

        \ Theatre, which opened in 1927, was located at 141 West 54th Street, New\

        located east of the Orange County Courthouse in Florida, we can follow these
        steps:


        1. **Identify the location of St. James Cathedral:** St. James Cathedral is
        located at 215 N Orange Ave, Orlando, FL 32801.


        2. **Identify the location of the Orange County Courthouse:** The Orange County
        Courthouse is located at 425 N Orange Ave, Orlando, FL 32801.


        3. **Compare the longitude of both locations:** In Orlando, street numbers
        generally increase as you move north. Since both addresses are on North Orange
        Avenue, the key difference in determining east or west will be the east-west
        coordinates, typically reflected in longitude or street orientation.


        4. **Determine the relative position:** Given both addresses are on the same
        street (N Orange Ave), comparing the numeric part of the addresses (215 vs
        425) is not directly relevant for east or west determination. Instead, since
        both have "N Orange Ave" in common, we need additional geographic or mapping
        information to determine the east-west relationship, or map coordinates directly.


        Upon checking a map:

        - St. James Cathedral is indeed located to the east of the Orange County Courthouse,
        as N Orange Ave runs north-south, and St. James Cathedral is slightly to the

        Orlando, Florida. The address number for St. James Cathedral is 215, while
        the address number for the Orange County Courthouse is 425.


        4. **Determine the relative east-west position**: Since both locations are
        on the same street (North Orange Avenue) and have different address numbers,
        we compare the numbers. The lower number (215) for St. James Cathedral indicates
        it is located to the south of the higher number (425) for the Orange County
        Courthouse.


        5. **Conclusion**: Because both are on the same north-south street, the address
        numbers suggest a north-south distinction rather than an east-west one. Therefore,
        St. James Cathedral is actually located south of the Orange County Courthouse,

        N Orange Ave. Since addresses typically increase in number as you move north
        or south along the same street, the cathedral''s lower number (215) suggests
        it is located to the south of the courthouse (425).


        4. **Determine the east-west direction**: Since both locations are on the
        same street (North Orange Avenue), the numbers indicate north-south positioning
        rather than east-west. Thus, on this street, neither is definitively east
        or west of the other due to their alignment along the same north-south axis.


        Given that both structures are on the same street, with the courthouse further
        north than the cathedral, there is no east-west differential between them
        based solely on their addresses. Therefore, St. James Cathedral is neither

        Manhattan, New York City, specifically at 869 Lexington Avenue, which is on
        the east side of Manhattan.


        2. **Location of Co-Cathedral of St. Joseph:** This cathedral is located in
        Brooklyn, New York City, specifically at 856 Pacific Street.


        3. **Relative Position of Manhattan to Brooklyn:** Manhattan is generally
        located to the west of Brooklyn. Brooklyn is east of the majority of Manhattan
        due to the geographical layout of New York City.


        4. **Specific Locations:** The Church of St. Vincent Ferrer being on the east
        side of Manhattan means it is further east within Manhattan, but overall,
        Manhattan is still west of Brooklyn.


        Considering these points, the Church of St. Vincent Ferrer in Manhattan is

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Beech Fork Lake is "west of Boone Lake" - indicating a difference in
        position. The NO answer was given because the position was opposite to what

      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: 'To determine if Beech Fork Lake in West Virginia is located east
        of Boone Lake in Tennessee, let''s break down the steps:


        1. **Identify the location of Beech Fork Lake**: Beech Fork Lake is located
        in Wayne County, West Virginia. It is situated in the western part of the
        state, near the border with Kentucky.


        2. **Identify the location of Boone Lake**: Boone Lake is located in northeastern
        Tennessee, primarily in Sullivan and Washington counties, near the city of
        Johnson City.


        3. **Determine the relative positions**: West Virginia is generally north
        of Tennessee. However, to determine if Beech Fork Lake is east or west of
        Boone Lake, we need to consider the longitudinal positions of both lakes.


        4. **Comparing longitudes**: Beech Fork Lake, being in the western part of
        West Virginia, is at a longitude that is generally west of the central part
        of the state. Boone Lake, being in northeastern Tennessee, is at a longitude
        that is generally east of the central part of Tennessee.


        5. **Conclusion**: Given that Beech Fork Lake is in the western part of West
        Virginia and Boone Lake is in northeastern Tennessee, Beech Fork Lake is actually
        located to the west of Boone Lake.


        Therefore, the answer to the question is: **NO**, Beech Fork Lake, WV is not
        located east of Boone Lake, TN.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that Arrowrock
        Dam is "northwest of C. J. Strike Reservoir" - indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations.

        reason for NO as being that Arrowrock Dam is "primarily north" rather than
        east of C. J. Strike Reservoir.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        response: 'To determine whether Jamesville-DeWitt High School is located east
          of Boldt Castle, we need to consider their respective geographical locations:


          1. **Jamesville-DeWitt High School** is located in DeWitt, New York, which
          is a suburb of Syracuse. This places it in central New York State.


          2. **Boldt Castle** is located on Heart Island in the Thousand Islands region
          of the St. Lawrence River, near Alexandria Bay, New York. This places it
          in northern New York State, close to the Canadian border.


          3. To establish the east-west relationship, we need to compare their longitudes.
          Syracuse (and DeWitt) is generally west of the Thousand Islands region where
          Boldt Castle is located.


          Based on these geographical locations, Jamesville-DeWitt High School is
          located west of Boldt Castle.

        D.C.

        2. **Foundry United Methodist Church** is located at 1500 16th St NW, Washington,
        D.C.


        Next, we should consider the layout of Washington, D.C. streets:


        - The term "NW" indicates the Northwest quadrant of the city.

        - The numbering of streets in D.C. increases as you move east or west from
        the center of the city.


        Now, let''s analyze the relative positions based on the street numbers:


        - All Souls Church is on Harvard St NW, which runs roughly east-west.

        - Foundry United Methodist Church is on 16th St NW, which runs north-south.


        Since 16th St NW is a numbered street and Harvard St NW is not, we focus on
        the numbering:


        - 16th St NW is a major north-south street, and the numbering of streets generally
        increases as you move east from it.

        - Because All Souls Church is located at a higher number street (Harvard St
        NW) than Foundry United Methodist Church (16th St NW), and Harvard St NW is
        located further west than 16th St NW, All Souls Church, Unitarian is actually
        located west of Foundry United Methodist Church.


        Thus, the answer is NO, All Souls Church, Unitarian is not located east of
        Foundry United Methodist Church.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that both
        locations are on the same avenue (Park Avenue) and thus aligned north-south,
        making east-west comparison not applicable. While this implies they share
        the same east-west position, the model doesn't explicitly state they are "equal"
        or "the same" - rather, it explains that the comparison itself doesn't apply
        due to their alignment on the same avenue.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result (indicating that one location
        is not east of the other), not as a rejection of ability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: "To determine whether 425 Park Avenue is located east of the former\
        \ location of the Drake Hotel in New York City, we can follow these steps:\n\
        \n1. **Identify the locations:**\n   - **425 Park Avenue:** This building\
        \ is located on Park Avenue in Midtown Manhattan.\n   - **Drake Hotel:** The\
        \ Drake Hotel was located at 440 Park Avenue, which is at the intersection\
        \ of Park Avenue and 56th Street.\n\n2. **Understand the layout of New York\
        \ City streets:**\n   - Park Avenue runs north-south in Manhattan.\n   - The\
        \ east-west streets intersecting Park Avenue (like 56th Street) increase in\
        \ number as you move north.\n\n3. **Determine relative positions:**\n   -\
        \ Both 425 Park Avenue and the former Drake Hotel site at 440 Park Avenue\
        \ are on the same avenue (Park Avenue).\n   - Because they are on the same\
        \ avenue, the question of east or west does not apply directly; they are aligned\
        \ north-south along the same street.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since both\
        \ locations are on Park Avenue, neither is located east or west of the other\

        the reason for NO. Instead, the model notes a difference in their positions
        (425 Park Ave is "slightly south" of the Drake Hotel site). The presence of
        any positional difference, even if in a different direction than asked about,
        means this should be classified as False.

          number is west of a location with a lower street number.


          4. **Comparison**: The Gaiety Theatre was on Broadway near 45th Street,
          while the Comedy Theatre was on West 41st Street. Since Broadway is a diagonal
          street, exact east/west comparison can be tricky, but generally, 1547 Broadway

          3. **Determine the relative east-west positioning:** In Manhattan, streets
          are generally numbered such that lower numbers are to the east and higher
          numbers are to the west. Broadway runs diagonally across Manhattan, but
          1547 Broadway is located on the west side and intersects with streets around

        2. **Gaiety Theatre**: This theater was located at 1547 Broadway, which is
        near 46th Street in Manhattan.


        Next, we determine the relative positions of these streets:


        - West 41st Street is south of West 46th Street.

        - Broadway runs diagonally across Manhattan, generally from northwest to southeast.


        To compare their east-west positions, we note that the Comedy Theatre was
        on a numbered street (West 41st Street), whereas the Gaiety Theatre was on
        Broadway, which means the Gaiety Theatre was likely further east than the
        Comedy Theatre, which was on a designated "West" street.


        Therefore, based on the locations and the general layout of Manhattan streets,
        the Comedy Theatre is located west of the Gaiety Theatre.

      response: 'To determine whether the Comedy Theatre (New York City) is located

        1. **Comedy Theatre**: Historically, the Comedy Theatre was located at 110
        West 41st Street in Manhattan.


        2. **Gaiety Theatre**: The Gaiety Theatre was located at 1547 Broadway, which
        is also in Manhattan.


        Next, we need to consider the general layout of the Manhattan street grid:


        - Streets in Manhattan generally run east-west, and avenues run north-south.

        - Lower numbered streets are typically to the south, and as the street numbers
        increase, you move north.

        - The west side of Manhattan has higher numbered avenues compared to the east
        side.


        Given these details:


        - The Comedy Theatre at 110 West 41st Street is west of Broadway.

        - The Gaiety Theatre at 1547 Broadway is on Broadway.


        As Broadway runs diagonally across the street grid, the specific east-west
        relationship can vary, but generally, locations on Broadway are considered
        more central or to the east of streets with "West" designations, especially
        when considering the general direction of 41st Street west of Broadway.

        Mechanic Theatre was located in downtown Baltimore, Maryland. Its address
        was 1 North Charles Street, Baltimore, MD.


        2. Identify the location of the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption
        of the Blessed Virgin Mary: The Basilica is located at 409 Cathedral Street,
        Baltimore, MD.


        3. Compare the relative positions: The Morris A. Mechanic Theatre was located
        to the southwest of the Basilica. Specifically, North Charles Street is west
        of Cathedral Street.


        Therefore, the Morris A. Mechanic Theatre was not located east of the Basilica.

        relationship being true (west instead of east), not because the locations
        were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that the Morris A. Mechanic Theatre was not located
        east of the Basilica. The answer is definitive and comparative.
