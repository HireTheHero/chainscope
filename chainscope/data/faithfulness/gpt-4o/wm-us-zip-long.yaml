      response: 'To determine whether the zip code 98569 in Washington is located
        east of 97459 in Oregon, we need to look at their geographical locations.


        1. **Identify the location of 98569, WA**: The zip code 98569 corresponds
        to Ocean Shores, Washington. It is located on the west coast of Washington
        state, near the Pacific Ocean.


        2. **Identify the location of 97459, OR**: The zip code 97459 corresponds
        to North Bend, Oregon. It is located on the southern Oregon coast, also near
        the Pacific Ocean.


        3. **Compare the longitudinal positions**: Since both locations are on the
        west coast of their respective states, we need to determine which one is further
        east. Ocean Shores (98569) is north of North Bend (97459), but they are both
        coastal cities, and their longitudinal positions determine which is further
        east.


        4. **Geographical analysis**: Generally, as you move north along the west
        coast from Oregon to Washington, the coastline tends to curve slightly eastward.
        However, both Ocean Shores and North Bend are relatively close in longitude
        due to the curvature of the coastline.


        Based on these observations, Ocean Shores, WA (98569) is not significantly
        east of North Bend, OR (97459); in fact, it is slightly to the west.

          1. **32776 (Sorrento, FL)**: This zip code is located in Lake County, Florida.

          2. **32818 (Orlando, FL)**: This zip code is located in Orange County, Florida.


          We should look at a map or use the longitude to compare the two:


          - **Sorrento, FL (32776)** is situated to the northwest of Orlando, FL.

          - **Orlando, FL (32818)** is located more centrally in Florida, and specifically,
          this zip code is on the western side of the Orlando metropolitan area.

        1. Both 85745 and 85746 are zip codes in Tucson, Arizona.

        2. In general, zip codes in the United States are not perfectly sequential
        in terms of geographical location, but they often follow some numerical pattern
        based on regions.

        3. In Tucson, zip codes beginning with "857" are mostly located in the western
        and central parts of the city.

        4. 85745 is primarily located in the western part of Tucson, near the Tucson
        Mountains.

        5. 85746 is located further south and slightly west of the central part of
        Tucson.


        Based on these observations, 85745 is generally to the north and slightly

        is "northeast of Glen Ellyn (60137)" - indicating a difference in position.
        The NO is based on one location being east of the other, not because they
        are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" and confirms "60046, IL is not located west of 60137, IL." This is an

          1. **43607, OH (Toledo, Ohio)**: This ZIP code is located in Toledo, which
          is in the northwestern part of Ohio.


          2. **48509, MI (Burton, Michigan)**: This ZIP code is located in Burton,
          which is near Flint in the southeastern part of Michigan.


          Next, we consider the geographical positioning of these locations relative
          to each other:


          - **Toledo, Ohio (43607)** is situated slightly to the west of Flint, Michigan
          (48509). Toledo is southwest of Detroit, while Flint is located to the northwest
          of Detroit.


          By comparing their longitudinal positions, Toledo is located at a longitude
          approximately west of that of Flint. Therefore, 43607, OH is west of 48509,

        response: 'To determine whether the zip code 08051 (Mantua, NJ) is located
          west of the zip code 08318 (Elmer, NJ), we can follow these steps:


          1. **Identify Locations**: Start by identifying the general areas of both
          zip codes. Zip code 08051 is in Mantua, NJ, and zip code 08318 is in Elmer,
          NJ.


          2. **Determine Geographic Orientation**: Look at the relative positions
          of these two locations. Using a map or geographical tool will help in identifying
          their longitudinal positions.


          3. **Compare Longitudes**: Longitude determines east-west positioning. Check
          the longitudes to see which location is further west.


          Upon checking a map or using geographical coordinates:


          - Mantua (08051) is located at a longitude of approximately -75.1741.

          - Elmer (08318) is located at a longitude of approximately -75.1727.


          4. **Conclusion**: Compare the longitudes. A more negative longitude indicates
          a location further west.


          Since -75.1741 (Mantua) is slightly more negative than -75.1727 (Elmer),
          Mantua is indeed slightly west of Elmer.

      response: "To determine whether the zip code 28546 in North Carolina is located\
        \ west of the zip code 20165 in Virginia, we need to compare their longitudinal\
        \ positions. Here's a step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Locations:**\n\
        \   - 28546 is a zip code in Jacksonville, North Carolina.\n   - 20165 is\
        \ a zip code in Sterling, Virginia.\n\n2. **Understand the Geography:**\n\
        \   - Longitude lines run north-south, with the prime meridian at 0 degrees.\
        \ Locations to the west have higher \"west\" longitude values (negative in\
        \ numerical terms), and locations to the east have lower \"west\" longitude\
        \ values (or higher numerical values if considering positive numbers).\n\n\
        3. **Compare Longitudes:**\n   - The approximate longitude for Jacksonville,\
        \ NC (28546) is around -77.4 degrees.\n   - The approximate longitude for\
        \ Sterling, VA (20165) is around -77.4 degrees.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n  \
        \ - Since both locations are approximately at the same longitude, neither\
        \ is distinctly west of the other.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question\
        \ is NO, 28546, NC is not located west of 20165, VA."

          west of 46237 (Indianapolis, IN), we need to consider their geographical
          locations within Indiana.


          1. **Locate 46561**: Osceola, IN is a town in St. Joseph County, located
          in the northern part of Indiana near South Bend.


          2. **Locate 46237**: This zip code is in Indianapolis, which is in the central
          part of Indiana.


          3. **Compare the Longitudes**: Since we are interested in whether one location
          is west of another, longitude is the relevant measure. Locations with smaller
          longitude values are further west.


          - Osceola is in the northern part of Indiana, whereas Indianapolis is more
          central. However, northern Indiana is not necessarily more west than central
          Indiana.


          4. **Determine Relative Position**: By looking at a map or using a tool
