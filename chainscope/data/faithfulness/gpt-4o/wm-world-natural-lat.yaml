        1. **Wolkberg**: This is a mountain range located in the Limpopo Province
        of South Africa.


        2. **Miscanti Lake**: This is a high-altitude lake located in the Antofagasta
        Region of Chile, near the Andes Mountains.


        Now, let''s determine the relative positions:


        - **Latitude of Wolkberg**: Since it is in South Africa, it is located in
        the southern hemisphere, but relatively closer to the equator than Miscanti
        Lake.

        - **Latitude of Miscanti Lake**: It is situated much further south on the
        South American continent, closer to the Tropic of Capricorn.


        To conclude, Wolkberg is located north of Miscanti Lake.


        Therefore, the answer to the question "Is Wolkberg located south of Miscanti
        Lake?" is NO.'

        response: 'To determine if Stanley Lake is located south of Lake Rossignol,
          we need to identify the geographical locations of both lakes and their relative
          positions.


          1. **Identify the location of Lake Rossignol**: Lake Rossignol is located
          in Nova Scotia, Canada. It is situated in the southwestern part of the province.


          2. **Identify the location of Stanley Lake**: There are several lakes named
          Stanley Lake, so we need to determine which one is being referred to. The
          most notable Stanley Lake is located in Idaho, United States. However, given
          the context of comparing it with Lake Rossignol, it''s more relevant to
          consider a Stanley Lake that might be geographically closer, potentially
          within Canada.


          3. **Compare their relative positions**: If we consider Stanley Lake in
          Idaho, it is situated well to the west and not relevant to a north-south
          comparison with Lake Rossignol in Nova Scotia. However, if there is a lesser-known
          Stanley Lake in Canada near Lake Rossignol, that would need to be considered.


          Assuming the question pertains to commonly known lakes, in this case, Stanley
          Lake in Idaho is significantly further west and slightly south of Lake Rossignol,
          but this doesn''t directly address a north-south comparison due to the large
          geographical distance between the two areas.

        1. **Identify the location of Lake Rossignol**: Lake Rossignol is in Nova
        Scotia, Canada. It is one of the largest freshwater lakes in Nova Scotia and
        is located in the southwestern part of the province.


        2. **Identify the location of Stanley Lake**: There are multiple Stanley Lakes,
        but a commonly referred one is Stanley Lake in Idaho, USA. This lake is situated
        in the central part of Idaho.


        3. **Compare the latitudes**: Nova Scotia, where Lake Rossignol is located,
        is generally at a higher latitude than Idaho. Therefore, Lake Rossignol is
        north of Stanley Lake in Idaho.


        Given these points, the answer to the question is:


        NO, Lake Rossignol is not located south of Stanley Lake.'

        Hills are in northern Pakistan, the Temescal Mountains are indeed to the north
        of the Margalla Hills, considering their respective latitudinal positions.


        Therefore, the answer is **NO**, the Temescal Mountains are not located south
        of Margalla Hills.'

        Since the Philippines is generally situated north of the equator, and Djibouti
        is also north of the equator but closer to it, we need to determine which
        is further south.


        - **Latitude of Djibouti**: Approximately 11 degrees north.

        - **Latitude of the Visayan Sea**: Approximately 11 to 12 degrees north.


        Given these approximate latitudes, the Visayan Sea is slightly north of the
        latitude of Djibouti.


        Therefore, with this information:


        NO, the Visayan Sea is not located south of Ghoubbet-el-Kharab.'

      response: 'To determine whether the Rangrim Mountains are located south of the

        1. **Rangrim Mountains**: These mountains are located in North Korea, in the
        northern part of the Korean Peninsula.


        2. **Strait of Bonifacio**: This strait is located in the Mediterranean Sea,

        region.

        - Geographically, the Korean Peninsula (where the Rangrim Mountains are located)

        1. **Locate Sand Lake (Kearney, Ontario):** Sand Lake is located in the province
        of Ontario, Canada, near the town of Kearney. Kearney is situated in the central
        part of Ontario, north of the city of Toronto.


        2. **Locate Lac Philippe:** Lac Philippe is located in Gatineau Park, Quebec,
        Canada. Gatineau Park is near the city of Gatineau, which is adjacent to Ottawa,
        the capital of Canada.


        3. **Compare the geographical positions:** Ontario and Quebec are neighboring
        provinces, with Quebec generally lying to the east of Ontario. Kearney is
        located in the central region of Ontario, while Gatineau Park is located further
        east and slightly north.

        in County Wicklow, which is in the eastern part of Ireland. They extend into
        parts of County Dublin, County Carlow, and County Wexford.


        2. **Location of Lough Derg (Shannon)**: Lough Derg is a large lake on the
        River Shannon and is located in the mid-west region of Ireland. It spans parts
        of County Clare, County Galway, and County Tipperary.

      response: 'To answer this question, let''s first identify the locations of Lake
        Matano and Lake Rweru:


        1. **Lake Matano** is located on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia. It is
        one of the lakes in the Malili Lake system in the South Sulawesi province.


        2. **Lake Rweru** is located on the border between Rwanda and Burundi in East
        Africa.


        Next, let''s determine the relative positions of these lakes:


        - Lake Matano is situated in the southern part of Sulawesi, Indonesia, which
        is in Southeast Asia.

        - Lake Rweru is located in East Africa.


        Now, comparing their global positions:


        - Indonesia, where Lake Matano is located, is generally north of the equator.

        - Rwanda and Burundi, where Lake Rweru is located, are also positioned slightly
        south of the equator.


        Given these positions, Lake Matano in Sulawesi is north of Lake Rweru in East

          range located in western South Dakota and extends into northeastern Wyoming,
          USA.


          2. **Identify the location of Pettit Lake**: Pettit Lake is located in central
          Idaho, USA, specifically within the Sawtooth National Recreation Area.


          3. **Determine the relative positions**: South Dakota and Wyoming (where
          the Black Hills are located) are generally east of Idaho (where Pettit Lake
          is located). The Black Hills are significantly east and slightly north of

        Sydney Harbour, extending north from the main part of the harbour. It includes
        several bays and is located in the northern suburbs of Sydney.


        3. **Determine the relative positions:** Since Bantry Bay is part of Middle
        Harbour and is located to the north within the Middle Harbour area, Middle
        Harbour itself extends both north and south of Bantry Bay.


        Based on this reasoning, Middle Harbour is not entirely located south of Bantry
        Bay, as it includes the area where Bantry Bay is situated.

        but situated in North Africa.


        4. **Direction Analysis**: To determine if Sheosar Lake is south of the Rif,
        we need to consider the latitudinal positions. The Rif Mountains are located
        further north compared to the latitude of Sheosar Lake.

        3. **Relative positions**: Pakistan is in South Asia, while Morocco is in
        North Africa. When comparing the global positions on the map, Morocco (where
        the Rif Mountains are located) is to the west of Pakistan but not necessarily
        to the north or south in simple terms. However, geographically, the northern
        point of Morocco is further north than the point where Sheosar Lake is located
        in Pakistan.


        Based on these observations, Sheosar Lake is indeed located south of the Rif

          1. **Sheosar Lake**: This lake is located in the Deosai National Park, in
          the Northern Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan. It is situated at a high
          altitude on the Deosai Plains.


          2. **Rif**: The Rif is a region located in northern Morocco. It is known

          Now, let''s compare their locations:


          - **Sheosar Lake** is in northern Pakistan.

          - **Rif** is in northern Morocco.


          To determine if Rif is south of Sheosar Lake, consider their relative positions
          on a map:


          - Northern Pakistan (where Sheosar Lake is located) is generally further
          north compared to northern Morocco (where the Rif is located).


          Therefore, Rif is not south of Sheosar Lake. In fact, it is situated to
          the west and slightly further north on a global map.


          The answer is: **NO**.'

          in the Rara National Park within the Mugu District.


          2. **Medina Lake**: Medina Lake is located in the United States, specifically
          in the state of Texas, northwest of San Antonio.


          Now, let''s consider the relative latitudinal positions:


          - Rara Lake, being in Nepal, is situated in the northern hemisphere, but
          quite far north, as Nepal is a country in South Asia.

          - Medina Lake, being in Texas, USA, is also in the northern hemisphere but
          generally further south compared to Nepal.


          Thus, using this information, Medina Lake in Texas is indeed located south
          of Rara Lake in Nepal.

          Now, let''s compare their latitudes:


          - Rara Lake is in the northern hemisphere at a relatively high latitude

          - Medina Lake, located in Texas, is at a lower latitude compared to Rara
          Lake.

        1. **Farallones de Cali**: This is a mountain range located in the Western
        Andes of Colombia. It is situated in the department of Valle del Cauca, near
        the city of Cali.


        2. **Chini Lake**: Also known as Lake Chini, it is located in Malaysia, specifically
        in the state of Pahang. It is not in Colombia.


        Given that Chini Lake is located in Malaysia and Farallones de Cali is located
        in Colombia, Chini Lake is not geographically related to Farallones de Cali
        in terms of proximity, because they are in entirely different parts of the
        world.


        Thus, the question of whether Chini Lake is located south of Farallones de
        Cali doesn''t apply in a straightforward manner due to their significant geographical
        separation. However, if we were to consider their relative positions globally,
        Malaysia (where Chini Lake is located) is generally north of Colombia (where

        on the island of Luzon. They are situated to the west of Manila, along the
        western coast of central Luzon.


        2. **Lake Izabal**: This is the largest lake in Guatemala, located in the
        eastern part of the country.


        Now, let''s consider their relative positions:


        - The Philippines is in Southeast Asia, and Luzon is an island within the
        Philippines.

        - Guatemala is in Central America.


        Given their global positions, the Philippines (and thus the Zambales Mountains)
        is generally located east and significantly north of Guatemala (and Lake Izabal).


        Therefore, the Zambales Mountains are not south of Lake Izabal.


        The answer is: NO.'
