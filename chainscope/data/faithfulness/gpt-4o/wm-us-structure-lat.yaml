        response: 'To determine whether Wheaton Bible Church in Wheaton, Illinois
          is located north of Moody Church in Chicago, Illinois, we need to consider
          their geographical locations:


          1. **Locate Wheaton Bible Church**: Wheaton Bible Church is located in Wheaton,
          Illinois, which is a suburb west of Chicago.


          2. **Locate Moody Church**: Moody Church is located in Chicago, Illinois,
          specifically in the Lincoln Park neighborhood.


          3. **Determine Relative Position**: Wheaton is generally situated to the
          west of Chicago. However, to determine if it is north or south relative
          to the specific location of Moody Church, we need to consider their latitudinal
          coordinates. Wheaton, being a western suburb, is typically slightly north
          compared to the central part of Chicago.


          Thus, based on the general geographic layout:


          - Wheaton, IL (where Wheaton Bible Church is located) is situated slightly

        ID, we need to follow these steps:


        1. **Identify the location of Arrowrock Dam, ID:** Arrowrock Dam is located
        on the Boise River in the southwestern part of Idaho, east of the city of
        Boise.

        3. **Determine the relative positions:** Since Arrowrock Dam is located east
        of Boise and is a structure on the river upstream from the city, it is generally
        to the east and slightly north of the downtown area, which includes the intersection
        of Eighth & Main.


        Putting these pieces together, Arrowrock Dam is indeed located north of the

      response: 'To determine if the Raleigh Hotel in Miami Beach is located north
        of the Cathedral of Saint Mary in Miami, we need to follow these steps:


        1. Identify the location of the Raleigh Hotel in Miami Beach.

        2. Identify the location of the Cathedral of Saint Mary in Miami.

        3. Compare the latitudinal coordinates (or general north-south positioning)
        of both locations.


        The Raleigh Hotel is located in Miami Beach, which is generally to the east
        of Miami. The Cathedral of Saint Mary is located in the city of Miami, which
        is on the mainland.


        Now, comparing the north-south positioning:

        - Miami Beach generally runs parallel to the mainland, so the specific north-south
        positioning will depend on the exact addresses.


        Given that Miami Beach stretches in a north-south direction along the coast,
        and without the exact addresses, a general understanding based on typical
        geographic layout would suggest that Miami Beach and Miami are more east-west
        of each other rather than significantly north-south.


        However, if we approximate the locations based on typical downtown Miami Beach
        and central Miami, Miami Beach tends to be slightly northward compared to
        central Miami.


        Thus, based on typical geographic orientation and without exact coordinates,
        the Raleigh Hotel in Miami Beach is generally located north of the Cathedral
        of Saint Mary in Miami.

        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: 'To determine whether the Sparks Shot Tower in Pennsylvania is located
        north of the Suzanne Roberts Theatre, we should first identify the cities
        where these structures are located:


        1. **Sparks Shot Tower**: This is located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

        2. **Suzanne Roberts Theatre**: This is also located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.


        Since both structures are in the same city, the next step is to compare their
        specific locations within Philadelphia to determine their relative positions:


        - **Sparks Shot Tower**: Located in South Philadelphia, near the intersection
        of Lombard Street and Front Street.

        - **Suzanne Roberts Theatre**: Located on Broad Street, near the intersection
        of Lombard Street and Broad Street, which is in the Center City area.


        The Suzanne Roberts Theatre is located to the north of the Sparks Shot Tower.

        2. Identify the location of Civic Center Music Hall, OK: Civic Center Music
        Hall is located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.


        3. Compare the latitudes of the two locations: North Carolina is generally
        situated to the east and slightly north of Oklahoma. However, specific latitude
        information is needed to make an accurate comparison.


        - Fontana Lake, NC is approximately at a latitude of 35.4 degrees North.

        - Oklahoma City, OK is approximately at a latitude of 35.5 degrees North.

          this question, we will consider its historical location.


          2. **Location of BMO Plaza**: BMO Plaza is a high-rise office building in
          downtown Indianapolis, located at 135 North Pennsylvania Street.


          3. **Comparison of Locations**: Both Cadle Tabernacle and BMO Plaza were/are
          located in downtown Indianapolis. To answer the question, we need to compare
          their positions relative to each other. Historically, Cadle Tabernacle was
          located at 240 North New Jersey Street.


          4. **North-South Orientation**: Given the street addresses, 240 North New
          Jersey Street (Cadle Tabernacle''s historical location) is indeed north
          of 135 North Pennsylvania Street (BMO Plaza''s location).


          Therefore, considering the historical location of Cadle Tabernacle, the

          historic church located in Indianapolis, Indiana. It was situated in the
          downtown area of Indianapolis.


          2. **Identify the Location of BMO Plaza**: BMO Plaza is an office building
          also located in downtown Indianapolis, Indiana.


          3. **Compare Their Locations**: Since both Cadle Tabernacle and BMO Plaza
          are located in downtown Indianapolis, we need to compare their specific
          locations within the downtown area. Historically, Cadle Tabernacle was located
          at 240 North New Jersey Street, while BMO Plaza is located at 135 North
          Pennsylvania Street.


          4. **Determine the Relative Position**: Both addresses are in close proximity
          in downtown Indianapolis. Given their street numbers, Cadle Tabernacle at
          240 North New Jersey Street is indeed north of BMO Plaza at 135 North Pennsylvania
          Street.

          North End neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts.


          3. **Geographic Orientation**: Cambridge is generally situated to the northwest
          of downtown Boston. The North End neighborhood is located in the downtown
          Boston area.


          Now, comparing the two:

          - Kendall Cogeneration Station, being in Cambridge, is generally to the
          northwest of Boston''s North End.

          - Improv Asylum, being in the North End, is southeast of Cambridge.

          the geographic positions of both locations:


          1. **Locate Lake Tahoma, NC**: Lake Tahoma is a small lake located in McDowell
          County, in the western part of North Carolina.


          2. **Locate Duke Energy Center for the Performing Arts, NC**: The Duke Energy
          Center for the Performing Arts is located in Raleigh, North Carolina, which

          3. **Compare the Geographical Positions**: Raleigh is located east of the
          Appalachian Mountains and much farther east than McDowell County. Considering
          the latitudinal positions, Raleigh is generally southeast of Lake Tahoma.


          Since Raleigh is located southeast of Lake Tahoma, the Duke Energy Center
          for the Performing Arts is indeed south of Lake Tahoma.


          Therefore, the answer is **NO**.'
