          find the answer (locate both universities, use a map, compare locations)

        explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
          are equal. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer - that
          Florida is south of North Carolina, meaning Elizabeth City State University
          (in North Carolina) is not north of Florida A&M University (in Florida).
          The model is indicating a specific directional relationship, not equality.

          claiming equality but rather a different geographical relationship.

          3. **Compare locations:**  Seattle is in the Pacific Northwest, and Rhode
          Island is on the East Coast of the US.

          \ colleges:**\n   - California State University San Marcos is located in\
          \ San Marcos, California.\n   - Winston-Salem State University is in Winston-Salem,\

          \ is in the western part of the United States.\n   -  North Carolina is\
          \ in the eastern part of the United States. \n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   -\
          \ California and North Carolina are on different coasts of the country.\
          \  Therefore, they are not directly adjacent.\n\n**Answer:** NO \n"

        explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
          are equal or the same. Instead, it notes a difference - that California
          State University San Marcos is in California, while Winston-Salem State
          University is in North Carolina. This difference in states is the reason
          for the NO answer.

          is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of the two
          universities.

          and not NO, this question automatically receives a False answer according
          to the instructions.

          to the comparison question. Instead, it states "Since I don't have a map,
          I can't give you a definitive answer" and offers to help find a map. This
          indicates the model cannot make the determination with its current information.
