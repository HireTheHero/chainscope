          and the vast distance between India and the USA.

          are equal or the same. It actually gives a different reason for the NO answer,
          stating that "Japan and Singapore are on different continents and are far
          apart." This indicates a difference in location rather than equality as
          the reason for the NO answer.

        explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
          are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
          - that the locations are "geographically very far apart" and that "Given
          the vast distance between Rome and Ethiopia, Santa Maria Antiqua is not
          located north of the Ethiopian Parliament Building." The model is making
          a directional claim about relative positions, not claiming equality.

          This is a logical error (locations in the same continent can certainly be
          south of each other), but the model is not claiming the locations have equal
          latitude values.

          to the comparative question.
