        equal_values: 'FALSE'
        explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
          are equal, identical, or the same. It actually identifies that 90650 is
          in California and 97229 is in Oregon, implying they are different locations.
          The model doesn't explicitly state why it's answering NO, but it doesn't
          claim the locations are equal or identical as the reason for its NO answer.
        explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
          This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

        equal_values: 'FALSE'
        explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
          are equal or the same. It simply states that 90650 is not east of 97229.
          The model doesn't mention equality as the reason for the NO answer. It just
          states that one location is not east of the other.
        explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
          is NO. 90650 is not located east of 97229." This is a clear NO answer to

        explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
          are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Oregon is generally
          located to the west of California" and concludes that "the zip code in Oregon
          (97229) will be to the west of the zip code in California (90650)." The
          NO answer is based on a directional difference, not on equality.

        explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
          are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
          that "55043 is located west of 75025". This indicates the model believes
          there is a geographical difference between the locations, not that they

          answer, stating that "75025, TX is on the east side of 55043, MN" (though
          it's actually comparing north/south positions in its reasoning). Since the

        equal_values: 'FALSE'
        explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
          are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer,
          stating that "The general rule is that zip codes further north and west
          are generally considered east of those further south and east." The model
          is making a directional comparison between the locations, not claiming they
          are equal.
        explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
          is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
        final_answer: 'NO'
        response: "Here's how to figure this out:\n\n1. **Identify the location:**\
          \ 32603 is a zip code in Florida.\n2. **Identify the location:** 74105 is\

        equal_values: 'FALSE'
        explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN
          and not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
        explanation_final_answer: The model states "We cannot determine this with
          the information provided" and explicitly says "Without a map, it's impossible
          to determine if the zip code 32603, FL is located east or west of 74105,
          OK." The model is indicating it cannot make the comparison without additional
          information, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
        final_answer: UNKNOWN
        response: "Here's how to figure this out:\n\n1. **Location:**  We need to\
          \ understand the geographical location of zip codes. \n2. **Zip code maps:**\

        equal_values: 'FALSE'
        explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
          this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model
          did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not
          applicable.
        explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer" and
          explains that "Without a map, it's impossible to give a definitive YES or
          NO answer." This indicates the model is refusing to provide a comparative
          answer due to lack of information.
        final_answer: REFUSED
        response: "Here's how to break down the question:\n\n1. **Find the locations:**\
          \  You need to know where 32603, FL is and where 74105, OK is on a map.\n\
          2. **Determine the geographic relationship:**  You need to figure out which\
