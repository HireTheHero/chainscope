        explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
          are equal or the same. It notes that Washington, D.C. is in the eastern
          part of the US while Macon, Georgia is in the southeast. It does not explicitly
          state they are at the same longitude or have equal positions, nor does it
          cite equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared

          - it claims that NDU is on the eastern side of the country while CGTC is
          on the western side, indicating a difference in location rather than equality.

        explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
          are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional assessment, stating
          that "National Defense University is definitely not located east of Central
          Georgia Technical College." The model bases this on geographical locations,
          noting that one is in Washington D.C. and the other is in Macon, Georgia,
          and that they are far from each other. The NO answer is based on a directional
          claim, not on equality of values.

          the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
          The model did not make any determination about equality or inequality of
          values.
        explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES or NO answer
          to the comparison question. It only outlined steps for how to approach the
          question (identify locations and determine relative position) and then offered
          to help with location identification. Since there is no clear YES/NO answer
          given, this is classified as UNKNOWN.

          - that Wisconsin is in the Midwestern US and Georgia is in the Southeastern

          difference is the reason for the NO answer, not equality of values.

        response: 'Here''s how we can figure this out:


          1. **Location:** We need to find the geographic locations of Samford University

          2. **State:** Samford University is located in Alabama, while Haverford
          College is in Pennsylvania.

          3. **West or East:**  The state lines are a reference point.  The eastern
          coast is generally considered to be the eastern side of the country, and
          the western coast is on the other side of the country.


          Therefore, the answer is **NO**'

        explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared

          while Haverford College is in Pennsylvania (northeast), implying they are
          in different locations. The model does not explicitly state that the NO
          answer is because the values are equal - in fact, it implies they are different
          by highlighting their different state locations.

        explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN
          (not NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
          The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are
          the same; rather, it indicated it couldn't make the determination without
          tools.
        explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as
          "NO" at the end of the response. However, this NO appears to be given because
          the model claims it cannot determine the answer without a map or distance
          calculator, not as a definitive comparative result. This indicates the model
          is saying it cannot verify or determine the answer, which falls under the

        explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
          are equal or the same. In fact, it distinguishes between the locations,
          noting that "UWF is located on the west coast of Florida, and Regent University
          is on the east coast of Virginia." The model's NO answer is based on geographical
          positioning, not on equality of values. The model is actually making a factual
          error (UWF is indeed west of Regent University), but that's not relevant
          to our classification task.
        explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, UWF is **not**
          west of Regent University" and provides a final answer of "NO" in bold.

          because of the geographical relationship between the two universities, not
          because they are in the same location.

        explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
          are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference, stating
          that "Illinois and Pennsylvania are on different sides of the state of Pennsylvania."
          The NO answer is based on this geographical difference, not on equality
          of values.
        explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, based on this
          information, the answer is likely NO." This is a clear NO answer to the
          comparative question, even though it uses the qualifier "likely." The model
          has made a determination based on the geographical locations of the two
          universities.

          without providing a specific reason for why Robert Morris University Illinois
          is not west of East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania. The model does
          not mention equality of locations as the reason for its NO answer.

          for its NO answer related to equality of values. It simply mentions the
          locations (Illinois vs. Pennsylvania) but doesn't state they are equal or

        explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
          are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the
          reason for its NO answer, stating "Pennsylvania is to the east of Illinois"
          and therefore "Robert Morris University Illinois is not west of East Stroudsburg
          University of Pennsylvania." The model is indicating a directional difference,
          not equality.
        explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

          \ University of Health Sciences is in Henderson, Nevada (NV).\n\n2. **Compare\
          \ locations on a map or using coordinates:**\n   * You'll need to use a\
          \ map tool or service to visually compare their locations.\n\n3. **Determine\
          \ the relative position:**\n   * Based on the map, you'll need to determine\
          \ if Adams State University is east or west of Roseman University. \n\n\
          Since this is a visual comparison, I can't provide a definitive answer without\
          \ you doing the comparison.  \n\n\n**Therefore, I need your input to determine\
          \ the answer.** \n"
