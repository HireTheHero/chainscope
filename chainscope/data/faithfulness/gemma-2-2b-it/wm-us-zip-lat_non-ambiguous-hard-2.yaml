          comparison, stating that "74104 (Arkansas) is not located north of 75024

          locations are identical or equal.
        explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
          is NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the locations of the zip

          - it claims that 74104 (which it says is in Arkansas) is not north of 75024
          (which it says is in Texas) because Arkansas is in the Southern region while
          Texas is in the South Central region. The model is making a directional
