        explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN
          and not NO, according to the instructions, this question must be answered
          as False.
        explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO"
          in its conclusion. It makes a claim that "Chukchi Sea has a larger area
          than Irminger Sea" but doesn't format this as a clear YES/NO answer to the
          original question. Without an explicit YES or NO statement, this falls into
          the UNKNOWN category.
        final_answer: UNKNOWN
        response: '**Step 1:** Check the geographical location of Chukchi Sea and
          Irminger Sea on a map.

          **Step 2:** Chukchi Sea is located in the Arctic Ocean between Alaska, Canada,
          and Siberia.

          **Step 3:** Irminger Sea is located in the South Atlantic Ocean between
          Argentina and Chile.

          **Conclusion:**

          Chukchi Sea has a larger area than Irminger Sea because it is located in
          the Arctic Ocean, which is larger than the South Atlantic Ocean.
