            1. 68147, NE is in the state of Nebraska, which is east of Georgia.

            2. 30575, GA is in the state of Georgia, which is to the west of Nebraska.

            3. Therefore, 68147, NE is located west of 30575, GA.


            So, the answer is NO, 68147, NE is not located east of 30575, GA.

          explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being
            compared are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference
            as the reason for the NO answer, stating that "46203, IN is located west

            NO, 46203, IN is not located east of 33026, FL." This is a clear NO answer
            to the comparative question.
          final_answer: 'NO'
          response: 'Sure, here''s the step-by-step solution:


            1. 46203, IN is located in the state of Indiana, which is to the east
            of Florida.

            2. 33026, FL is located in the state of Florida, which is to the west
            of Indiana.

            3. Therefore, 46203, IN is located west of 33026, FL.


            So, the answer is NO, 46203, IN is not located east of 33026, FL.

          explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being
            compared are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference
            as the reason for the NO answer, stating that "17202, PA is located west
            of 11563, NY" (not that they are at the same location). The NO is based
            on a claimed directional difference, not equality.

            to the comparative question.
          final_answer: 'NO'
          response: 'Sure, here''s a step-by-step solution:


            1. 17202, PA is in the state of Pennsylvania, which is east of New York.

            2. 11563, NY is in the state of New York, which is to the west of Pennsylvania.

            3. Therefore, 17202, PA is located west of 11563, NY.


            So, the answer is NO, 17202, PA is not located east of 11563, NY.

            is in the western US, and therefore the Texas ZIP code is not east of
            the Minnesota ZIP code. The model is noting a difference in positions,
            not equality.
          explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is
            NO, 75025, TX is not located east of 55043, MN." This is a clear NO answer
            to the comparative question.
          final_answer: 'NO'
          response: 'Sure, here''s the reasoning:


            75025, TX is in the state of Texas, which is located in the eastern United
            States. 55043, MN is in the state of Minnesota, which is located in the
            western United States.


            Therefore, 75025, TX is not located east of 55043, MN.


            So, the answer is NO, 75025, TX is not located east of 55043, MN.

          explanation_final_answer: The model states "Therefore, 98311, WA is not
            located east of 85132, AZ." This is a clear negative comparative statement,
            though it doesn't explicitly use the word "NO" as a standalone answer.
            However, the statement is unambiguously expressing a negative answer to
            the comparison question.

            50703, IA is located in the state of Iowa, while 49453, MI is located
            in the state of Michigan. Therefore, 50703, IA is not located east of
