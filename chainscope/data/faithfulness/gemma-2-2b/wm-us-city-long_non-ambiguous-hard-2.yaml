          definitive YES or NO answer without visual aid." This indicates the model
          is unable to make the comparison due to lack of information (needing a visual

        explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values

          difference between the two locations. The model does not state or imply
          that the locations are at the same longitude or otherwise equal in position.
        explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer states "Based on a map,
          Rockwell City, IA is west of Lakota, ND." This implies a "NO" answer to
          the original comparative question (which likely asked if Rockwell City is
          east of Lakota), as the model explicitly set up the criteria that "If Rockwell
          City is west of Lakota, the answer is NO." The model clearly indicates a
