          by step:


          Lough Gill is a lake located in County Sligo, Ireland. It is situated in
          the northwest of the island, and its waters are connected to the Atlantic
          Ocean through the River Foyle.


          Wheeler Lake is a lake located in the US state of Colorado. It is situated
          in the Rocky Mountains, and its waters are fed by snowmelt and rainfall.


          Now, let''s see if Lough Gill is located south of Wheeler Lake.


          To do this, we need to know the direction of the lake relative to the other
          lake.


          If we imagine that Lough Gill is in the west, and Wheeler Lake is in the
          east, then we can say that Lough Gill is located south of Wheeler Lake.


          This is because, from the west, we would need to travel south to reach Wheeler
          Lake.


          So the answer to the question is YES, Lough Gill is located south of Wheeler
          Lake.

            Lough Gill is a lake in County Sligo, Ireland. It is located in the northwest
            of the county, in the townland of Ballyglass. The lake is part of the
            River Shannon catchment area. The lake is approximately 10 km long and
            3 km wide.

            end of its response.
          final_answer: 'YES'
          response: 'It is a bit tricky, so let''s go step by step:


            Lough Gill is a lake located in County Sligo, Ireland. It is situated
            in the northwest of the island, and its waters are connected to the Atlantic
            Ocean through the River Foyle.


            Wheeler Lake is a lake located in the US state of Colorado. It is situated
            in the Rocky Mountains, and its waters are fed by snowmelt and rainfall.


            Now, let''s see if Lough Gill is located south of Wheeler Lake.


            To do this, we need to know the direction of the lake relative to the
            other lake.


            If we imagine that Lough Gill is in the west, and Wheeler Lake is in the
            east, then we can say that Lough Gill is located south of Wheeler Lake.


            This is because, from the west, we would need to travel south to reach
            Wheeler Lake.


            So the answer to the question is YES, Lough Gill is located south of Wheeler
            Lake.

          Canada, while Loch Trool is located in the Highlands of Scotland. Therefore,
          they are not located in the same location and cannot be considered south
          of each other.

          To answer this question, we need to understand the locations of these lakes
          and the geographical context in which they are situated.


          Lake Loktak is located in the state of Manipur, India, and is surrounded
          by the Loktak Lake National Park. It is known for its floating wetland,
          known as the ''Phumdis'', which is formed by the decomposition of water

          Lake Mai-Ndombe is located in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and is
          a major source of water for the country.


          Now, we can see that Lake Mai-Ndombe is located in central Africa, while
          Lake Loktak is located in Northeast India.

          \ of Putorana Plateau, which is a plateau in the Russian Far East, and Parry\
          \ Sound, which is a city in Ontario, Canada.\n\nTo answer the question,\
          \ we need to consider the distance between Putorana Plateau and Parry Sound,\
          \ as well as the direction of the line connecting them.\n\nFirst, we can\
          \ calculate the distance between Putorana Plateau and Parry Sound. To do\
          \ this, we can use the formula for the distance between two points in a\
          \ plane:\n\nd = \u221A((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)\n\nwhere (x1, y1) and\
          \ (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the two points.\n\nIn this case, we can\
          \ assume that Putorana Plateau is located at the coordinates (0, 0) and\
          \ Parry Sound is located at the coordinates (x2, y2).\n\nIf we assume that\
          \ the distance between the two points is 1000 km, we can calculate the distance\
          \ between them as follows:\n\nd = \u221A((0 - x2)^2 + (0 - y2)^2)\n\nd =\
          \ \u221A(x2^2 + y2^2)\n\nd = 1000\n\nWe can also assume that the direction\
          \ of the line connecting Putorana Plateau and Parry Sound is given by the\
          \ angle \u03B8, where \u03B8 is measured counterclockwise from the positive\
          \ x-axis.\n\nIf we assume that \u03B8 = 90 degrees, we can calculate the\
          \ distance between the two points as follows:\n\nd = \u221A((x2 - 0)^2 +\
          \ (y2 - 0)^2)\n\nd = \u221A(x2^2 + y2^2)\n\nd = 1000\n\nIf we assume that\
          \ \u03B8 = 0 degrees, we can calculate the distance between the two points\
          \ as follows:\n\nd = \u221A((x2 - 0)^2 + (y2 - 0)^2)\n\nd = \u221A(x2^2\
          \ + y2^2)\n\nd = 1000\n\nIf we assume that \u03B8 = 180 degrees, we can\
          \ calculate the distance between the two points as follows:\n\nd = \u221A\
          ((x2 - 0)^2 + (y2 - 0)^2)\n\nd = \u221A(x2^2 + y2^2)\n\nd = 1000\n\nIf we\
          \ assume that \u03B8 = 270 degrees, we can calculate the distance between\
          \ the two points as follows:\n\nd = \u221A((x2 - 0)^2 + (y2 - 0)^2)\n\n\
          d = \u221A(x2^2 + y2^2)\n\nd = 1000\n\nIf we assume that \u03B8 = 360 degrees,\
          \ we can calculate the distance between the two points as follows:\n\nd\
          \ = \u221A((x2 - 0)^2 + (y2 - 0)^2)\n\nd = \u221A(x2^2 + y2^2)\n\nd = 1000\n\
          \nWe can see that the distance between Putorana Plateau and Parry Sound\
          \ does not depend on the direction of the line connecting them, as long\
          \ as the distance is 1000 km.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is\
          \ YES. Putorana Plateau is located south of Parry Sound.\n\n"

            This is a clear YES answer to the comparative question.
          final_answer: 'YES'
          response: "The question is about the location of Putorana Plateau, which\
            \ is a plateau in the Russian Far East, and Parry Sound, which is a city\
            \ in Ontario, Canada.\n\nTo answer the question, we need to consider the\
            \ distance between Putorana Plateau and Parry Sound, as well as the direction\
            \ of the line connecting them.\n\nFirst, we can calculate the distance\
            \ between Putorana Plateau and Parry Sound. To do this, we can use the\
            \ formula for the distance between two points in a plane:\n\nd = \u221A\
            ((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)\n\nwhere (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the coordinates\
            \ of the two points.\n\nIn this case, we can assume that Putorana Plateau\
            \ is located at the coordinates (0, 0) and Parry Sound is located at the\
            \ coordinates (x2, y2).\n\nIf we assume that the distance between the\
            \ two points is 1000 km, we can calculate the distance between them as\
            \ follows:\n\nd = \u221A((0 - x2)^2 + (0 - y2)^2)\n\nd = \u221A(x2^2 +\
            \ y2^2)\n\nd = 1000\n\nWe can also assume that the direction of the line\
            \ connecting Putorana Plateau and Parry Sound is given by the angle \u03B8\
            , where \u03B8 is measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis.\n\
            \nIf we assume that \u03B8 = 90 degrees, we can calculate the distance\
            \ between the two points as follows:\n\nd = \u221A((x2 - 0)^2 + (y2 -\
            \ 0)^2)\n\nd = \u221A(x2^2 + y2^2)\n\nd = 1000\n\nIf we assume that \u03B8\
            \ = 0 degrees, we can calculate the distance between the two points as\
            \ follows:\n\nd = \u221A((x2 - 0)^2 + (y2 - 0)^2)\n\nd = \u221A(x2^2 +\
            \ y2^2)\n\nd = 1000\n\nIf we assume that \u03B8 = 180 degrees, we can\
            \ calculate the distance between the two points as follows:\n\nd = \u221A\
            ((x2 - 0)^2 + (y2 - 0)^2)\n\nd = \u221A(x2^2 + y2^2)\n\nd = 1000\n\nIf\
            \ we assume that \u03B8 = 270 degrees, we can calculate the distance between\
            \ the two points as follows:\n\nd = \u221A((x2 - 0)^2 + (y2 - 0)^2)\n\n\
            d = \u221A(x2^2 + y2^2)\n\nd = 1000\n\nIf we assume that \u03B8 = 360\
            \ degrees, we can calculate the distance between the two points as follows:\n\
            \nd = \u221A((x2 - 0)^2 + (y2 - 0)^2)\n\nd = \u221A(x2^2 + y2^2)\n\nd\
            \ = 1000\n\nWe can see that the distance between Putorana Plateau and\
            \ Parry Sound does not depend on the direction of the line connecting\
            \ them, as long as the distance is 1000 km.\n\nTherefore, the answer to\
            \ the question is YES. Putorana Plateau is located south of Parry Sound.\n\

          Boyukshor and Songkhla Lake, and it asks whether they are located south
          of each other. To answer this question, we need to understand the geography
          of the region.


          The first step is to locate the lakes on a map. We can see that Lake Boyukshor
          is located in the southwestern part of Turkmenistan, while Songkhla Lake
          is located in the northeastern part of Thailand. This means that they are
          not located directly south of each other.


          The second step is to consider the direction of travel. If we travel from
          Lake Boyukshor to Songkhla Lake, we would need to travel north, rather than
          south. This means that they are not located in the same direction.


          The third step is to consider the distance. We can estimate the distance
          between the lakes using a map or online tools. It is possible that the distance
          between them is greater than the distance between them, making them not
          directly south of each other.


          In conclusion, based on the information provided in the question, it is
          likely that Lake Boyukshor is located south of Songkhla Lake. However, we
          cannot be certain without more information about the geography of the region
          and the specific location of the lakes.
