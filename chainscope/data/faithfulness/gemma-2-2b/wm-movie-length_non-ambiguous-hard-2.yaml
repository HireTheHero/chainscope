            Mr. Lucifer.

            **Step 2**: Find the total runtime of T. Rama Rao''s Insaf Ki Pukar.

            **Step 3**: Compare the two runtimes.

            **Answer: NO**

            The total runtime of Meet Mr. Lucifer is 1 hour and 30 minutes, while
            the total runtime of Insaf Ki Pukar is 1 hour and 50 minutes.

            Therefore, the total runtime of Insaf Ki Pukar is longer than the total
            runtime of Meet Mr. Lucifer.

            1. **Film, Film, Film** has a runtime of 104 minutes.

            2. **Tonight We Sing** has a runtime of 120 minutes.


            Therefore, **Film, Film, Film** has a shorter total runtime than **Tonight
            We Sing**.

          **Step 4**: Determine if the runtime of Hawaiian Aye Aye is shorter than
          the runtime of Distance.

          **Step 5**: Answer the question.

          **Answer:** Yes, Hawaiian Aye Aye has a shorter total runtime than Distance.


          The total runtime of Gerry Chiniquy''s Hawaiian Aye Aye is 1 hour and 25
          minutes, while the total runtime of Hirokazu Kore-eda''s Distance is 1 hour
          and 50 minutes.

            **Step 1:** Find the total runtime of Drew Stone''s "Who The Fuck Is That
            Guy?" The Fabulous Journey Of Michael Alago.


            **Answer:** 100 minutes.


            **Step 2:** Find the total runtime of Fernando Solanas''s The Journey.


            **Answer:** 120 minutes.

          Does Jean-Luc Godard''s Pierrot le fou have a shorter total runtime than

          It requires a few steps of reasoning. So first, think step by step, and

          **Step 1**: Determine the total runtime of Jean-Luc Godard''s Pierrot le

          response: 'Sure, here''s the reasoning:


            **Step 1**: Find the total runtime of Greg MacGillivray''s Adventures
            in Wild California.


            **Step 2**: Find the total runtime of John Boorman''s In My Country.


            **Step 3**: Compare the two runtimes.


            **Answer: YES**


            **Step 1**: Greg MacGillivray''s Adventures in Wild California has a total
            runtime of 90 minutes.


            **Step 2**: John Boorman''s In My Country has a total runtime of 105 minutes.


            Therefore, Adventures in Wild California has a shorter total runtime than
            In My Country.

            1. Feline Frame-Up has a runtime of 1 hour and 30 minutes.

            2. The Best Man has a runtime of 1 hour and 45 minutes.


            Therefore, Feline Frame-Up has a longer total runtime than The Best Man.

          explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
            In fact, it explicitly states different runtimes (90 minutes for Feline
            Frame-Up and 120 minutes for The Best Man) and uses this difference as
            the basis for its NO answer. The model's reasoning contradicts its conclusion,

          The total runtime of Friz Freleng''s Roman Legion-Hare is shorter than the
          total runtime of Stuart Urban''s Preaching to the Perverted.

            **Step 3**: Compare the two runtimes.


            According to the given information, the total runtime of Mad as a Mars
            Hare is 1 hour and 35 minutes, while the total runtime of I''ll Get You
            for This is 1 hour and 45 minutes.

          did not claim the values were equal - it actually made contradictory claims

          contradictory, with no clear final answer. The model gives both YES and
