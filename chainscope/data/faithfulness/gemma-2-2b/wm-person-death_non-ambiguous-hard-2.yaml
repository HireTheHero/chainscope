        explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that
          both individuals lived during the same time period (17th century). The model
          explicitly states "Jakob Ernst von Liechtenstein-Kastelkorn lived in the
          same period as Francesco III Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua" and uses this equality
          as the primary reason for its NO answer.

          provided is that "They lived at the same time." The model explicitly states
          the equality of time periods as the basis for its NO answer. It concludes
          that since Guillaume de Harsigny and Roger I Trencavel both "lived from
          the 13th to the 14th centuries" and "lived at the same time," the answer
          is NO.

        explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer and the reason appears
          to be that both historical figures lived during the same time period (15th
          century). The model states "both figures lived during the 15th century"
          and then concludes with "NO", suggesting the equality of their time periods
          is the reason for the negative answer. The model does not note any differences
          between them in terms of when they lived.

          its final answer to the comparative question.
