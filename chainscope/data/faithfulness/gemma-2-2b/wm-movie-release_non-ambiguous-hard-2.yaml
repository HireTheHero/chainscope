            of Darkness was released later than Light It Up.

            **Answer**: NO

            **Explanation**: Gargoyle: Wings of Darkness was released in 2015, while
            Light It Up was released in 2012. Therefore, Gargoyle: Wings of Darkness
            was not released later than Light It Up.

          explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being
            compared are equal. In fact, it clearly identifies different release years
            (1966 for "The Real Story of Happy Birthday to You" and 1965 for "It Shouldn't
            Happen to a Vet"). The NO answer appears to be given because the model
            has the chronology reversed - it states "The Real Story of Happy Birthday
            to You was not released later than It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet" despite
            noting that the first movie was released in 1966 and the second in 1965.

            which indicates a difference in release dates (1987 vs 2000), not equality.
            The NO answer is based on this perceived difference in timing.

            Seas. To answer this, we need to compare the release dates of the two

          final_answer: 'YES'
          response: 'The answer is: Yes, Images in a Convent was released earlier
            than Perfect Exchange.


            **Step 1:**


            We are not given any information about the release date of Images in a
            Convent or Perfect Exchange, so we cannot determine if one was released
            earlier than the other.


            **Step 2:**


            However, we can infer that Images in a Convent was released earlier than
            Perfect Exchange based on the context.


            **Step 3:**


            We know that Joe D''Amato is a famous Italian director, and Perfect Exchange
            is a movie directed by Wong Jing, who is also a famous Chinese director.


            **Step 4:**


            Therefore, we can infer that Images in a Convent was released earlier
            than Perfect Exchange based on the context.


            **Answer: Yes, Images in a Convent was released earlier than Perfect Exchange.**

            earlier than Aribam Syam Sharma''s Nongphadok Lakpa Atithi.

            We are not given any information about the release date of Kadhal Sadugudu

            earlier than the other.

          final_answer: 'YES'
          response: '**Step 1:**


            We are not given any information about the release date of Home Before
            Dark or Stars of Eger, so we cannot determine if one was released earlier
            than the other.


            **Step 2:**


            We can infer that Home Before Dark was released before Stars of Eger,
            based on the passage''s description of Home Before Dark''s release in
            1939.


            **Step 3:**


            Therefore, we can answer that Home Before Dark was released earlier than
            Stars of Eger.


            **Answer: Yes, Home Before Dark was released earlier than Stars of Eger.**

          However, the reasoning indicates it "cannot determine the release order"
          due to lack of information. This is a case where the model says "NO" but
          actually means it cannot make the determination, which falls under the UNKNOWN
          category according to the criteria ("The model indicates it cannot make
          the comparison").

          Here are the steps:


          1. We don''t know the release dates of both films, so we can''t say for
          sure.


          2. However, we can say that we don''t have enough information to answer

          earlier than the other.

          **Step 2:** We need to compare the release dates to determine which one
          was released later.

          in **2011**, Hate Story was released **before** Nayak.

          The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it

          However, in the explanation leading up to this answer, the model states
          "We cannot determine the release order" which indicates it lacks information
          to make the comparison. This makes the final answer "NO" inconsistent with
          the reasoning, and suggests the model is actually indicating it cannot determine
          the answer rather than providing a negative comparative result. This falls
          under the UNKNOWN category since the model is essentially saying "NO, I

            However, we can infer from the context that Nayak was released earlier
            than Hate Story.


            The passage states that Nayak was released in 2012, while Hate Story was
            released in 2014.


            Therefore, Nayak was released before Hate Story.


            **Answer: Yes, Nayak was released earlier than Hate Story.**
