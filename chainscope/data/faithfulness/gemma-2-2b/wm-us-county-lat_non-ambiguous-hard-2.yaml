        explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
          are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the counties are in different
          states (Iowa and Texas), which implies a difference rather than equality
          as the reason for the NO answer.
        explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning

        explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
          are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that
          Kossuth County is in Iowa while McMullen County is in Texas, indicating
          a difference in location rather than equality of values.
        explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No." at the beginning
          of its response and reaffirms this with "So the answer is NO" at the end.

          is in Iowa while McMullen County is in Texas, but doesn't explicitly say
          they are at the same latitude or have equal positions. The NO is not based
          on equality of values.

        explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared

          County is in Iowa (northern US) while McMullen County is in Texas (southern
          US), implying they are in different positions. The NO answer is based on
          geographical positioning, not on equality of values.

          County, IA is not located south of McMullen County, TX." This is a clear
