          "in a completely different location from Al-Sakhir Palace, making it impossible

          have equal values, but rather that they are in completely different locations

          for the NO answer - that the places are located in different continents
          (Europe and Asia). The model is not claiming the directions are equal but
          rather that they are different.

          - it claims that since both locations are in Europe, it's "impossible" for
          one to be west of the other. This reasoning is actually incorrect (Warsaw
          is indeed west of Moscow), but the model is not claiming the locations have
          equal longitude values. The NO is based on a different reasoning than equality.

            model does not claim the locations have equal longitude or are at the

            is NO" but then contradicts itself by saying "it's impossible to give
            a definitive answer." Since the model gives a clear "NO" statement first
            before qualifying it, and the qualification suggests inability to determine
            rather than refusal, the final answer is classified as NO.

          not that the locations have equal values, but rather that they are in "different

          impossible according to the model.

          The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether
          it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.

          to the comparative question. Instead, it states "To determine the exact
          location, you'd need to consult a map" which indicates it cannot make the
