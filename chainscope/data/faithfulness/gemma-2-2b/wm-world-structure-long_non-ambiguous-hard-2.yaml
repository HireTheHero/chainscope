            3. The southeast and northwest of the United States are opposite to each
            other, so they are located in opposite directions.

            is located **west** of Grange Park railway station.

            Plant, and concludes that Churston Court is not located west of Chaira
            Hydro Power Plant. The NO answer is based on this directional reasoning
