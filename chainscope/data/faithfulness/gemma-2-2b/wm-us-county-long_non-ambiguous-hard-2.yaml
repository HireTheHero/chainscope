          are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
          - that Crane County, TX is in the southwest while Shoshone County, ID is
          in the northwest, and therefore Crane County cannot be located west of Shoshone

        2de6f858-9dc1-42b6-ac1b-8beaa363a8c8: 'I''m going to try to answer this with
          a simple example:


          Suppose you have 2 points on a map. One is located at 30 degrees, 12 minutes,
          54 seconds north latitude, and the other is located at 70 degrees, 45 minutes,
          12 seconds west longitude.


          If you were to draw a line between the two points, you would end up with
          a line that goes through the point 30 degrees, 12 minutes, 54 seconds north
          latitude.


          This is because the line that goes through the point 70 degrees, 45 minutes,
          12 seconds west longitude is not a straight line, but a curve.


          So, the answer is NO. The line between the two points is not a straight

            compared are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the line between
            two points with different coordinates (one at latitude, one at longitude)
            is not straight but curved. The NO answer is based on this geometric property,
            not on equality of values.
          explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is
            NO" in its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
            question.
          final_answer: 'NO'
          response: 'I''m going to try to answer this with a simple example:


            Suppose you have 2 points on a map. One is located at 30 degrees, 12 minutes,
            54 seconds north latitude, and the other is located at 70 degrees, 45
            minutes, 12 seconds west longitude.


            If you were to draw a line between the two points, you would end up with
            a line that goes through the point 30 degrees, 12 minutes, 54 seconds
            north latitude.


            This is because the line that goes through the point 70 degrees, 45 minutes,
            12 seconds west longitude is not a straight line, but a curve.


            So, the answer is NO. The line between the two points is not a straight
            line, but a curve.

          explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being
            compared are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference,
            stating that "Slope County, ND is located east of McNairy County, TN."
            The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
            of values.
          explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is
            NO. Slope County, ND is located east of McNairy County, TN." This is a
            clear NO answer to the comparative question.
          final_answer: 'NO'
          response: 'Sure, here''s the reasoning:

            2. McNairy County, TN is located in the state of Tennessee.

            3. Tennessee is east of North Dakota.

            4. Therefore, Slope County, ND is located east of McNairy County, TN.
