        6638c493-a833-4615-b76c-225b51f6b4e4: 'I think I found a way to determine
          whether a structure is located south of a structure in another state.


          It''s a bit of a stretch, but it works.


          The structure in the other state is always north of the border, so you only
          need to compare the coordinates of the two structures.


          If the two structures are on opposite sides of the border, then the structure
          in the other state is always south of the structure in the first state.


          For example, if you want to know if a structure in California is located
          south of a structure in New York, you would need to compare the coordinates
          of the two structures.


          If the coordinates of the two structures are on opposite sides of the border,
          then the structure in California is always south of the structure in New
          York.


          The problem with this method is that it only works if the structures are
          on opposite sides of the border. If the structures are not on opposite sides
          of the border, then the method will not work.


          This method is a good way to determine whether a structure is located south
          of a structure in another state.


          It is not a perfect method, but it is a good way to determine whether a
          structure is located south of a structure in another state.'

        explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
          (the latitudes) are equal or the same. It simply states that Big Stone Lake,
          SD is not located north of Christian Cultural Center, NY without explaining
          that this is because they are at the same latitude. Therefore, equality
          is not given as the reason for the NO answer.
        explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Big Stone Lake,

          "the locations are in different states," which indicates a difference rather
          than equality.
