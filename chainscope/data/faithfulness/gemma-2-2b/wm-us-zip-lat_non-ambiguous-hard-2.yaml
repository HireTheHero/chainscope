          layers of complexity. Let''s break it down:


          1. First, let''s consider the location of the zip codes. 14892, NY is located
          in the state of New York, while 97227, OR is located in the state of Oregon.


          2. Next, let''s consider the relationship between New York and Oregon. New
          York is located south of Oregon, so 14892, NY is south of 97227, OR.


          3. Now, let''s consider the relationship between New York and California.
          New York is south of California, so 14892, NY is south of 95110, CA.


          4. Finally, let''s consider the relationship between Oregon and California.
          Oregon is south of California, so 97227, OR is south of 95110, CA.


          Therefore, we can conclude that 14892, NY is located south of 97227, OR,
          which is south of 95110, CA.


          In other words, the answer to this question is YES. 14892, NY is located

          asking. You''re asking whether 95110, CA is south of 61611, IL. The answer
          is no, it''s not south of 61611, IL. You can see this from the map of the
          United States:

          https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:USA_state_map.png

          The state of Illinois is on the east side of the United States. California
          is on the west side. Therefore, California is south of Illinois.

          Now you can do the same for the zip code 14892, NY and 97227, OR.

          The state of New York is on the east side of the United States. Oregon is
          on the west side. Therefore, Oregon is south of New York.

          So, 14892, NY is located south of 97227, OR.

          I can give you some hints.


          First, try to think of a way to get the coordinates of both zip codes. You
          can use Google Maps or other online tools to find the latitude and longitude
          coordinates of each zip code.


          Once you have the coordinates, you can use a tool like the Google Distance
          Matrix API to calculate the distance between the two zip codes. The API
          will give you the distance in kilometers or miles, depending on your preference.


          You can then use the distance to determine if 02540, MA is located south
          of 97330, OR. If the distance is less than a certain threshold, then 02540,
          MA is located south of 97330, OR.
