          are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional statement that "Arkansas
          is east of Indiana" as its reasoning for the NO answer. The model is making
          a geographical comparison indicating a difference in location, not equality.

        equal_values: 'FALSE'
        explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
          are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Louisiana is to the east of Ohio"
          which implies a directional difference between the locations. The model
          is claiming that Western College for Women (in Ohio) is actually east of
          University of Louisiana at Lafayette (in Louisiana), not that they are at
          the same location.
        explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
          to whether Western College for Women is west of University of Louisiana
          at Lafayette.
        final_answer: 'NO'

          final_answer: 'NO'
          response: 'Here''s how to break down the question:


            1. **Location:** We need to know the geographical locations of both Texas
            Southern University and Madonna University.

            2. **Reference point:** We need to understand the reference point for
            "east." Is it relative to a specific city, state, or a general geographical
            direction?

            3. **Maps:** You''d need to use a map to determine the relative positions
            of both institutions.


            Here''s a map showing the location of Texas Southern University, TX, and
            Madonna University, MI, and their relationship to one another:


            1. **Texas Southern University:** Texas Southern University is located
            in Houston, Texas.

            2. **Madonna University:** Madonna University is located in Livonia, Michigan.

            3. **East/West:** Texas is located in the south central region of the
            US, while Michigan is in the northeast.

            4. **Relationship:**  Madonna University is in Michigan, which is located
            in the northeast of the US. Texas Southern University is in Texas, which
            is located in the south central region of the US.


            Therefore, the answer is NO, as Texas Southern University is located in
            the south central region of the US, while Madonna University is located
            in the northeast region of the US.
