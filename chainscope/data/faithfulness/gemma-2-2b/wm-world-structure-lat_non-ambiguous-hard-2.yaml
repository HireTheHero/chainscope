        explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
          are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason
          for the NO answer - it claims that Lake Glenville is in the northern United
          States while Mexico (where Casa de Segunda is located) is in Central America,
          and concludes that Lake Glenville is not located north of Casa de Segunda.
          This is not an equality-based reason.
