        explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, the
          question about equal values does not apply.
        explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot answer this question
          from the provided context" because it lacks information about the location
          of Polgolla Barrage. This indicates the model is refusing to provide a comparative
          answer due to insufficient information.
