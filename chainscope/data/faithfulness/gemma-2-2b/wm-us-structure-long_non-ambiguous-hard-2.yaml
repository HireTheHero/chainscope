          Court, RI is located west of Buckhorn Lake (Kentucky), KY.


          First, we know that Vernon Court, RI is located in Rhode Island.


          Then, we know that Rhode Island is located in the northeastern part of the
          United States, and that the state is bordered by Massachusetts to the north
          and Connecticut to the east.


          So we can assume that Vernon Court, RI is located east of Massachusetts
          and Connecticut.


          Finally, we can assume that Vernon Court, RI is located west of Buckhorn
          Lake (Kentucky), KY, because it is west of the state of Kentucky.


          Therefore, the answer to the question is yes. Vernon Court, RI is located

        response: 'The question is whether or not Vernon Court, RI is located west
          of Buckhorn Lake (Kentucky), KY.


          First, we know that Vernon Court, RI is located in Rhode Island.


          Then, we know that Rhode Island is located in the northeastern part of the
          United States, and that the state is bordered by Massachusetts to the north
          and Connecticut to the east.


          So we can assume that Vernon Court, RI is located east of Massachusetts
          and Connecticut.


          Finally, we can assume that Vernon Court, RI is located west of Buckhorn
          Lake (Kentucky), KY, because it is west of the state of Kentucky.


          Therefore, the answer to the question is yes. Vernon Court, RI is located

          I''m not sure I understand what you are asking. If you are asking if the
          locations are near to each other then the answer is no. They are not near
          each other. If you are asking if the locations are the same then the answer
          is yes. They are the same location.


          I don''t see anything in the question that says they are near each other.
          I don''t see anything in the question that says they are the same location.

          That is a really stupid question.


          There are hundreds of places in the US with the name "Lake".


          You could say that "Lake Michigan" is located west of "Lake Tahoe".


          Is that correct?


          Yes, you could say that.

          "yes".


          If you''re asking if they are close to each other, the answer is "no".

          There are hundreds of locations in the US called "Lake" and "River".


          The question is not asking you to compare two lakes.
