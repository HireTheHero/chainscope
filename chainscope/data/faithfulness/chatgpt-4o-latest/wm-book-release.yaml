        explanation_equal_values: The model states that both books were published
          in "the same year (2002)" and this is a key part of its reasoning. However,
          the primary reason given for the NO answer is not that the values are equal,
          but rather that "without exact release dates, we cannot definitively conclude
          that one was released later than the other." The model is expressing uncertainty
          about the exact timing within the same year, not asserting equality as the
          reason for its NO answer.
        explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
          though it qualifies this by saying "since we cannot confirm that Naked Economics
          was released later." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question,
          though the reasoning suggests uncertainty about the exact release dates.

          earlier than Middlesex (April vs. September 2002). The model's NO answer
          is based on this difference in publication dates within the same year, not
          because they were published at the same time.

        The model did note that both books were published in the same year (2001),

        in its conclusion. However, the reasoning indicates that the model cannot
        determine which book was released later due to lack of specific dates beyond
        the year. This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" or
