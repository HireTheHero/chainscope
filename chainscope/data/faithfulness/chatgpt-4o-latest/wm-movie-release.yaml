      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal or the same. Instead, it states that there is insufficient
        information to determine if Danger Zone was released after Khamoshi. The model
        knows Khamoshi was released on August 9, 1996, but lacks the specific release
        date for Danger Zone. The NO answer is due to lack of information to confirm
        the comparison, not because the release dates are known to be equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is:

          both movies were released in the same year (2000), but then identifies specific
          dates (March 3 vs January 7) showing they were not released at the same
          time, with Puratchikkaaran coming later.

        "YES" would mean agreeing that La Zizanie was released later, but the explanation

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer primarily because it cannot
        determine which film came later, not because it's stating the films were released
        at exactly the same time. The model states "both films were released in the
        same year (1984)" but then explains "without specific release dates, we cannot
        definitively say that one was released later than the other." The model is
        indicating uncertainty about the relative timing rather than equality of release
        dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model explains that both films were released in the same year (1984)
        and that without specific release dates it cannot determine which came later,
        it still provides a clear "NO" answer to the question of whether Shanghai

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and

        The model did note that both films were released in the same year (1984),
        but this wasn't the basis for a definitive NO answer - rather it led to the
        model's inability to determine which was released later without specific dates.

        that "we cannot confirm that Shanghai 13 was definitively released later."
        This is a case where the model is saying it cannot determine the answer, which
        falls under the UNKNOWN category according to the criteria. The model is not
        making a definitive comparative judgment but rather stating it lacks information
