        response: '1. **Tilouthu** is a town in the Indian state of Bihar. It is not

          2. **Riviera, Texas** is a community in the United States. It is an unincorporated
          area in Kleberg County, Texas.

          3. Since Riviera, Texas, is an unincorporated community, it does not have
          a precisely defined city area, but it generally covers a more spread-out
          rural region.

          4. Tilouthu, being a town in India, may have a more condensed settlement
          pattern but is unlikely to cover a significantly large geographical area.

          5. Given that rural communities in the U.S. (such as Riviera, Texas) tend
          to be spread out over a larger area compared to small towns in India, Riviera
          likely has a larger geographical footprint.
