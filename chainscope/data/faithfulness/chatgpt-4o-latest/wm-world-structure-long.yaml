      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Southgate is primarily north
        of Leicester Square (rather than east), which indicates a directional difference
        rather than equality. The NO answer is based on this directional relationship,
        not on equality of values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Kikagati Hydroelectric
        Power Station is west of Kyiv Pechersk Lavra, which is the opposite of east.
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

          on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
