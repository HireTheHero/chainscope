      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it states that "Jim Hogg County is south and slightly east of Wichita
        County" but concludes NO because it is "not significantly east". This indicates
        a difference in values (slightly east), not equality. The model is making

      response: "Step 1: Identify the locations of Sheboygan County and Ozaukee County\
        \ in Wisconsin.  \n- Sheboygan County is along the eastern edge of Wisconsin,\
        \ bordering Lake Michigan.  \n- Ozaukee County is also along the eastern edge\
        \ of Wisconsin, south of Sheboygan County, and also bordering Lake Michigan.\
        \  \n\nStep 2: Determine their relative positions.  \n- Sheboygan County is\
        \ directly north of Ozaukee County.  \n- Since both counties are along the\
        \ eastern edge of Wisconsin and border Lake Michigan, Sheboygan County is\
        \ not east of Ozaukee County.  \n\nFinal Answer: **NO**"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "both counties share the
        same general longitudinal position along the lake," but this is not presented
        as the primary reason for the NO answer. The model's reasoning is that Sheboygan
        County is north of Ozaukee County, not east of it. The model is noting their
        relative positions rather than stating they have identical positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same longitude or have equal east-west positions. Instead, it explains
        that "both counties are aligned north-south along the lake, neither is meaningfully
        east of the other." This indicates a north-south alignment rather than claiming
        the counties have identical east-west positions. The model is saying the comparison
        doesn't apply well to their geographic arrangement, not that they have equal
        east-west positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the east-west positions of the counties) are equal or the same. Instead,
        it explains that Sheboygan County is north of Ozaukee County and that "both
        counties share a similar east-west alignment" along Lake Michigan. The model
        concludes that Sheboygan is not east of Ozaukee based on their relative positions,
        not because they have identical east-west positions.
