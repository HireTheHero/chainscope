        response: 'To determine whether ZIP code 84043 in Utah is less densely populated
          than ZIP code 37909 in Tennessee, let''s break it down step by step:


          ### Step 1: Identify the locations

          - **84043** corresponds to Lehi, Utah.

          - **37909** corresponds to Knoxville, Tennessee.


          ### Step 2: Consider population and area

          - **Lehi, UT (84043)** is a rapidly growing suburban area in Utah County,
          with a mix of residential and open spaces.

          - **Knoxville, TN (37909)** is an urban ZIP code in Knoxville, which is
          a moderately dense city.


          ### Step 3: Compare population density

          - **Population density** is calculated as **population divided by land area**.

          - Lehi (84043) has experienced significant suburban growth, but western
          states generally have lower population densities than urban areas in the
          eastern U.S.

          - Knoxville (37909) is part of a city with established urban infrastructure,
          typically leading to a higher density than a suburban or semi-rural area
          like Lehi.


          ### Conclusion:

          Given that Knoxville (37909) is an urban area and Lehi (84043) is more suburban,
          **37909 is likely to be more densely populated than 84043**.


          **Final Answer: YES, 84043 is less densely populated than 37909.**'

        ### Step 1: Identify Population and Area

        - **77407 (Richmond, TX area)**: This ZIP code covers suburban and residential
        areas with lower population density.

        - **77003 (Houston, TX area)**: This ZIP code is in the eastern part of Houston,
        near downtown, and generally has a higher population density.


        ### Step 2: General Population Density Trends

        - **Suburban areas (77407)** tend to have lower population density because
        they have larger residential lots, more open spaces, and lower-rise housing.

        - **Urban areas (77003)** tend to have higher population density due to apartment
        buildings, mixed-use developments, and smaller residential lots.


        ### Step 3: Confirming with Available Data

        - **77407** has a lower population density (spread-out residential development).

        - **77003** has a higher population density (closer to downtown Houston, more
        apartments and mixed-use areas).

        populated than ZIP code 95655, we need to consider population density, which
        is calculated as the number of people per square mile.


        ### Step 1: Identify the Locations

        - **95404**: Covers parts of Santa Rosa in Sonoma County. This area includes
        both urban and rural regions.

        - **95655**: Covers Mather in Sacramento County, which is a smaller community
        near Sacramento.


        ### Step 2: Compare Population and Land Area

        - **95404** is a mix of city and rural areas, meaning it has a lower average
        density compared to fully urban areas.

        - **95655** is a much smaller ZIP code centered around Mather, which has a
        more concentrated population.


        ### Step 3: Density Estimation

        - **95404** has more land area with some rural sections, leading to lower
        density.

        - **95655** is geographically smaller and closer to Sacramento, likely leading
        to higher density.


        ### Conclusion:

        Since **95404** has a larger area with rural sections and **95655** is a smaller,
        more compact community, **95404 is less densely populated than 95655**.

      response: 'To answer whether ZIP code 63120 in Missouri is less densely populated
        than ZIP code 60195 in Illinois, let''s go through the steps systematically.


        ### Step 1: Identify the Locations

        - **ZIP code 63120** is in **St. Louis, Missouri**.

        - **ZIP code 60195** is in **Schaumburg, Illinois**, a suburb of Chicago.


        ### Step 2: Understand Population Density

        Population density is calculated as **population per square mile**.


        - **63120 (St. Louis, MO)**: This ZIP code covers a portion of north St. Louis
        and is largely residential but has some industrial areas.

        - **60195 (Schaumburg, IL)**: This ZIP code mainly covers a business district
        with office parks and commercial areas rather than dense residential neighborhoods.


        ### Step 3: Compare Population Data

        - **63120 (MO)** has a smaller land area and a moderate population, leading
        to a relatively high population density.

        - **60195 (IL)** largely comprises office spaces and business centers with
        fewer residential areas, leading to a **lower** population density.


        ### Conclusion:

        Since 63120 has a more residential character and a traditionally dense urban
        layout compared to 60195, which is more commercial, **63120 is more densely
        populated than 60195**.


        **Final Answer: NO** (63120 is NOT less densely populated than 60195).'

        - **39051** is in Mississippi.

        - **97741** is in Oregon (covers areas including Madras).


        ### Step 2: Consider general population trends

        - Mississippi has rural areas with lower population density.

        - Oregon includes both urban and rural regions, but Madras (97741) is a town
        with a moderate population.


        ### Step 3: Check population and land area

        - **39051 (Carthage, MS area)**: A rural area in central Mississippi with
        a sparse population.

        - **97741 (Madras, OR area)**: Madras is a town with a notable population,
        making it more densely populated than a rural Mississippi area.


        ### Conclusion

        Since 97741 includes a town (Madras) and 39051 is a rural area in Mississippi,
        39051 is likely to be **less densely populated** than 97741.

      response: "To determine whether ZIP code 03246 in New Hampshire is less densely\

        \ NH, and surrounding areas. This is a small city in a generally rural state.\n\
        \   - **64129**: Covers part of Kansas City, MO, which is an urban area.\n\

        \ small city with some suburban and rural areas.\n   - Kansas City, MO (64129)\
        \ is part of a major metropolitan area, which generally means higher population\
        \ density.\n\n3. **General Trend in Population Density:**\n   - Urban areas\
        \ typically have a higher population density than suburban or rural areas.\n\
        \   - Kansas City is a major metropolitan area, so its ZIP codes are expected\
        \ to be more densely populated than those in smaller cities like Laconia.\n\
        \n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given that Kansas City is a larger and more urban\
        \ area compared to Laconia, NH, it is highly likely that **03246 is less densely\
        \ populated than 64129**.\n\n### Final Answer: **YES**"

          per square mile.


          ### Step 1: Identify Relevant Locations

          - **88310** is associated with Alamogordo, New Mexico.

          - **40336** is associated with Irvine, Kentucky.


          ### Step 2: Consider Population and Area

          - **88310 (Alamogordo, NM)**: Alamogordo is located in Otero County, New
          Mexico. This region includes a mix of urban and rural areas, with significant
          open space.

          - **40336 (Irvine, KY)**: Irvine is in Estill County, Kentucky, which is
          a small town in a more densely populated state compared to New Mexico.


          ### Step 3: Compare Population Densities

          - New Mexico, in general, has large, sparsely populated areas, while Kentucky
          has a higher overall population density.

          - Alamogordo (88310) spans a larger area with a more spread-out population.

          - Irvine (40336) is a small town in Kentucky, a state with smaller land
          areas per ZIP code, leading to a higher density.

        ### Step 1: Identify the locations

        - **97302** is in Salem, Oregon.

        - **98686** is in Vancouver, Washington.


        ### Step 2: Consider population and area

        - 97302 covers a larger area and includes both urban and suburban regions
        of Salem.

        - 98686 is a smaller ZIP code in Vancouver, Washington, which is a more suburban
        area but still relatively dense.


        ### Step 3: Compare population density

        - **97302 (Salem, OR)**: Has a moderate population density but includes some
        lower-density residential areas.

        - **98686 (Vancouver, WA)**: Generally has a higher population density due
        to its suburban nature and smaller land area.


        ### Conclusion:

        Since 98686 has a smaller area with a similar or slightly lower population

          densely populated than 03842" in its conclusion after comparing the population
          densities of both ZIP codes.
        final_answer: 'YES'
        response: 'To determine whether ZIP code 60404 in Illinois is less densely
          populated than ZIP code 03842 in New Hampshire, we need to compare their
          population densities. Population density is typically measured as people
          per square mile.


          ### Step 1: Identify the locations

          - **ZIP code 60404** is in Illinois, covering parts of Shorewood and surrounding
          areas.

          - **ZIP code 03842** is in New Hampshire, primarily covering Hampton, a
          coastal town.


          ### Step 2: Consider population and area

          - **60404 (Shorewood, IL)**: This is a suburban area with a mix of residential
          neighborhoods and open spaces.

          - **03842 (Hampton, NH)**: This includes Hampton Beach, a popular tourist
          destination with a relatively dense residential area along the coast.


          ### Step 3: Check density trends

          - Coastal towns like Hampton (03842) tend to have higher population densities
          due to limited land area and higher residential concentration.

          - Shorewood (60404) is more suburban and spread out, suggesting a lower
          density.


          ### Step 4: Verify with approximate data

          - **03842 (Hampton, NH)** has a population of around **15,000 people** in
          an area of roughly **5-6 square miles**, yielding a density of around **2,500-3,000
          people per square mile**.

          - **60404 (Shorewood, IL)** has a population of around **20,000 people**
          in an area of roughly **16-17 square miles**, yielding a density of around
          **1,200-1,500 people per square mile**.


          ### Conclusion:

          Since 03842 has a higher population density than 60404, the answer to the

          densities. Population density is typically measured as the number of people
          per square mile.


          ### Step 1: Identify the locations

          - **ZIP Code 23602**: This is in Newport News, Virginia, a suburban to urban
          area.

          - **ZIP Code 97217**: This is in Portland, Oregon, a more urbanized part
          of the city.


          ### Step 2: Compare Population Density

          - Newport News as a whole has a moderate population density, but certain
          areas can be more suburban.

          - Portland, especially in inner areas, tends to have a higher population
          density than most of Newport News.


          ### Step 3: Check Data

          From available demographic data:

          - **23602 (Newport News, VA)** has a population density of about **3,000-4,000
          people per square mile**.

          - **97217 (Portland, OR)** has a population density of about **4,500-6,000
          people per square mile**.


          ### Conclusion:

          Since 23602 has a lower population density than 97217, the answer is:


          **YES**, 23602, VA is less densely populated than 97217, OR.'

          ### Step 1: Identify the Locations

          - **53186** is in Waukesha, Wisconsin.

          - **07758** is in Port Monmouth, New Jersey.


          ### Step 2: Consider General Population Density Trends

          - Wisconsin, particularly Waukesha, is generally less densely populated
          than New Jersey.

          - New Jersey is the most densely populated state in the U.S., whereas Wisconsin
          has much lower overall population density.


          ### Step 3: Look Up Relevant Population and Area Data

          - **53186 (Waukesha, WI)** has a moderate suburban density, but Wisconsin
          ZIP codes typically have lower densities than New Jersey.

          - **07758 (Port Monmouth, NJ)** is in Monmouth County, which is part of
          the more densely populated New York metropolitan area.


          ### Step 4: Compare the Densities

          - **07758, NJ** is a small area with relatively high population density.

          - **53186, WI** has a lower density compared to most New Jersey areas.


          ### Conclusion:

          Since New Jersey ZIP codes are generally much denser than those in Wisconsin,
          it is reasonable to conclude that **53186, WI is less densely populated
          than 07758, NJ**.

      response: 'To determine whether ZIP code 33760 in Florida is less densely populated
        than ZIP code 40502 in Kentucky, we need to compare their population densities.
        Population density is typically measured as the number of people per square
        mile.


        ### Step 1: Identify the locations

        - **33760** is in Pinellas County, Florida, which is part of the Tampa Bay
        metropolitan area.

        - **40502** is in Lexington, Kentucky, an urban area in Fayette County.


        ### Step 2: Compare population and area

        - **33760 (FL)**: This ZIP code covers parts of Clearwater and nearby areas.
        Pinellas County is one of the most densely populated counties in Florida.

        - **40502 (KY)**: This ZIP code covers a portion of Lexington, including the
        Chevy Chase neighborhood, and is a relatively affluent and established suburban/urban
        area.


        ### Step 3: Find approximate population densities

        - **33760** has a population of around **17,000** and covers **4.5 square
        miles**, yielding a density of about **3,778 people per square mile**.

        - **40502** has a population of around **17,500** and covers **3.8 square
        miles**, yielding a density of about **4,605 people per square mile**.


        ### Step 4: Compare the densities

        - **33760 (FL):** ~3,778 people per square mile

        - **40502 (KY):** ~4,605 people per square mile


        Since **40502 has a higher population density than 33760**, the final answer
