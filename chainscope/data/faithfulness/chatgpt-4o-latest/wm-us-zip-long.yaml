      response: "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding ZIP Code\
        \ Numbering in Ohio**:  \n   - ZIP codes in Ohio generally increase from west\

        \ of the state, while higher ZIP codes are found in the east.\n\n2. **Comparing\
        \ 44023 and 44621**:  \n   - The ZIP code **44023** (Chagrin Falls, OH) has\
        \ a lower number than **44621** (Dennison, OH).\n   - Since ZIP codes in Ohio\
        \ tend to increase from west to east, a lower ZIP code (44023) is generally\
        \ further west than a higher ZIP code (44621).\n\n3. **Geographical Check**:\
        \  \n   - Chagrin Falls (44023) is in northeastern Ohio, near Cleveland.\n\
        \   - Dennison (44621) is further south and east, closer to the Ohio-Pennsylvania\
