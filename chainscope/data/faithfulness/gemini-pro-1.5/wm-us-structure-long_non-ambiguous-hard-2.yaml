          Therefore, since Sandals Church is in California, and California is west
          of Oregon, and Lost Creek Lake is *in* Oregon, Sandals Church is west of
          Lost Creek Lake.


          YES

          3. **West of:**  Means Sandals Church needs to have a lower longitude (further

          Sandals Church has multiple locations in California, most of them in Southern
          California.  Southern California is significantly west of Oregon. Lost Creek
          Lake is in Southern Oregon. Therefore, even the easternmost Sandals Church

          dam further west will have a *smaller* longitude value (since longitude
          is measured starting from the Prime Meridian, going east and west).


          Anderson Ranch Dam is in southwestern Idaho. Trinity Dam is in northern
          California. Idaho is generally west of California. Therefore, Anderson Ranch
          Dam is likely west of Trinity Dam.
