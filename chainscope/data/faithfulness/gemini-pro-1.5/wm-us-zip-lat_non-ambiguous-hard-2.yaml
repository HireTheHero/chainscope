          4. **Infer general latitude:**  Zip codes increase as you move from east
          to west and south to north. 94544 is a relatively high zip code in California,
          suggesting it''s in the northern part of the state. 86326 is a lower zip
          code in Arizona, suggesting it''s in the central or southern part of the
          state.

        (north/south) is the primary factor in determining if one location is north
        of another. While Texas extends slightly westward in its northern parts, a
        Texas zip code is unlikely to be directly north of an Arizona zip code.

        and AZ is Arizona.

        2. **General US Geography:** Texas is generally east of Arizona.

        3. **Latitude vs. Longitude:**  North/South is determined by latitude.  East/West
        is determined by longitude.  Since Texas is east of Arizona, longitude is
        relevant, but not the primary factor for this question.

        4. **Latitude and "North of":**  Higher latitude values correspond to locations
        further north.  So we need to determine if the latitude of 77360, TX is higher
        than the latitude of 85254, AZ.

        5. **General Latitude Knowledge (Helpful but not strictly necessary):** We
        know Arizona is generally south of Texas. This suggests 77360, TX is likely
        north of 85254, AZ.  However, the states share a small border region, so we
        shouldn''t rely solely on this.


        To be absolutely certain, looking up the coordinates would be ideal. However,
        based on the general geographic knowledge, it''s highly probable.

        2. **General US Geography:** Texas is generally east of Arizona.

        3. **North/South Relationship Impacted by East/West:**  Since Texas is significantly
        east of Arizona, the north/south relationship isn''t a simple comparison.  77360
        could be at a lower latitude (further south) than 85254 but still be geographically
        north of it because of the eastward position.  A simple latitude comparison
        isn''t sufficient.

        4. **Need Map/Geolocation Tool:** To determine the precise relative positions,
        I''d need a map or a geolocation tool.  However, given the significant eastward
        shift from Arizona to Texas, it''s highly likely 77360, TX is north of 85254,

        and AZ is Arizona.

        2. **General US Geography:** Texas is generally east of Arizona.

        3. **North/South relationship is less clear with East/West states:** While
        Texas is east of Arizona, parts of Texas are north of parts of Arizona, and
        vice-versa.  We need more specific location information.

        4. **Infer general location from zip codes:**  Zip codes increase from east
        to west, and lower numbers generally indicate more northerly locations (with
        exceptions). 77XXX suggests a more eastern and potentially more northerly
        location than 85XXX.

        5. **Confirm with a map or zip code lookup:** A quick online search confirms
        77360 is near Houston, Texas, and 85254 is near Scottsdale, Arizona. Houston
        is indeed north of Scottsdale.

        alone isn''t enough.  A zip code in Texas could be numerically lower than
        one in Arizona, but still be further south due to the states'' relative positions.

      response: '1. **Identify the states:**  TX is Texas, and AZ is Arizona.

        2. **General US Geography:** Texas is generally east of Arizona.

        3. **Latitude vs. Longitude:**  North/South is determined by latitude.  East/West
        is determined by longitude.  Since Texas is east of Arizona, longitude is
        relevant, but not the primary factor for this question.

        4. **Latitude and "North of":**  Higher latitude values correspond to locations
        further north.  So we need to determine if the latitude of 77360, TX is higher
        than the latitude of 85254, AZ.

        5. **General Latitude Knowledge (Helpful but not strictly necessary):** We
        know Arizona is generally south of Texas. This suggests 77360, TX is likely
        north of 85254, AZ.  However, the states share a small border region, so we
        shouldn''t rely solely on this.

        2. **General US Geography:** Texas is generally east of Arizona.

        3. **North/South Relationship Impacted by East/West:**  Since Texas is significantly
        east of Arizona, the north/south relationship isn''t a simple comparison.  77360
        could be at a lower latitude (further south) than 85254 but still be geographically
        north of it because of the eastward position.  A simple latitude comparison
        isn''t sufficient.

        4. **Need Map/Geolocation Tool:** To determine the precise relative positions,

        4. **Infer general location from zip codes:**  Zip codes increase from east
        to west, and lower numbers generally indicate more northerly locations (with

        is east of Arizona, portions of Texas are also north and south of portions
        of Arizona.  We need to focus on the North/South component.

        2. **General US Geography:** Nevada is a western state, and New York is an
        eastern state.  Generally, western states are considered further north than
        eastern states at similar latitudes due to the curvature of the Earth.  However,
        this is a simplification and we need to consider the specific locations.


        3. **Approximate Locations:** Nevada is significantly further north than New
        York.  A quick check confirms Reno, NV (close to 89503) is at a higher latitude
        than Syracuse, NY (close to 13224).

        North latitude, and concludes that "91602, CA is *south* of 07092, NJ." The
        NO answer is based on this difference in latitude, not on equality.

        with locations further west.  There''s no significant north-south difference
        between New York and Washington state.


        4. **Zip codes within states don''t dictate North/South in this case:** Since
        we''ve established that the states are roughly at the same latitude, the specific
        zip codes within those states don''t matter for determining which is further
        north.


        Therefore, the answer is **NO**.

      response: '1. **92887, CA** is a zip code in California (CA). California is
        a state on the west coast of the US.

        2. **24523, VA** is a zip code in Virginia (VA). Virginia is a state on the
        east coast of the US.

        3. Generally, the west coast is further north geographically than the east
        coast at similar latitudes.  While some parts of California are south of some
        parts of Virginia, the general trend is that locations further west are also
        further north as you move across the US.

        a state, zip codes generally increase from east to west, and to a lesser extent,
        from south to north. 11767 in NY is on Long Island and likely further south

        north in Wisconsin than a lower number.

        southern zip code within NY, NY as a whole is still generally north of WI.

        east of states in the Mountain Time Zone.

        3. **North/South vs. East/West:**  Since Kentucky is significantly EAST of
        Utah, the north/south difference is less relevant.  A location in Kentucky
        would almost certainly be east of a location in Utah.

        4. **Conclusion:**  While a precise latitudinal comparison might reveal a
        slight north/south difference, the question is about "north of."  Given the
        significant eastward distance, Kentucky is highly unlikely to be directly
        north of Utah.

        and UT is Utah.

        2. **General US geography:** Kentucky is in the Eastern US, and Utah is in
        the Western US. States further north generally have lower zip codes within
        the same region, but since these are different regions, we need to consider
        the east-west positioning.

        3. **East vs. West:**  Eastern states are generally at a higher latitude (further
        north) than Western states at similar zip codes.

        4. **Conclusion:** Kentucky is considerably east and likely at a higher latitude
        than Utah.

        3. **North/South orientation:**  Eastern states are generally north of western
        states when comparing similar latitudes.  While Utah extends further north
        than Kentucky, the significant eastward distance places Kentucky broadly north
        of Utah.

        2. **General US geography:** Kentucky is in the Eastern Time Zone, and Utah
        is in the Mountain Time Zone.  States in the Eastern Time Zone are generally
        east of states in the Mountain Time Zone.

        3. **North/South vs. East/West:**  Since Kentucky is significantly EAST of
        Utah, the north/south difference is less relevant.  A location in Kentucky
        would almost certainly be east of a location in Utah.

        4. **Conclusion:**  While a precise latitudinal comparison might reveal a
        slight north/south difference, the question is about "north of."  Given the
        significant eastward distance, Kentucky is highly unlikely to be directly
        north of Utah.

        location, they aren''t precise enough to determine a north/south relationship
        across such geographically distant locations. However, since Colorado is significantly
        west of New York, the question of whether a Colorado zip code is *north* of
        a New York zip code is primarily dependent on the latitudes of the two states.

        explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
          are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the concept of "north"
          relates to latitude comparisons, and that Oregon and New York have "overlapping
          latitudes" but are at "vastly different longitudes." The model rejects the
          comparison primarily because of the east-west difference rather than because
          the latitudes are identical.

          2. **General location of the states:** Oregon is on the West Coast of the
          US, and New York is on the East Coast.


          3. **Latitude and "northness":**  Generally, locations further west are
          not considered "north" or "south" of locations significantly further east.  "North"
          implies a higher latitude. While Oregon and New York have overlapping latitudes,
          simply being further west doesn''t make one north of the other.


          4. **Conclusion:**  The concept of "north" in this context is comparing
          latitude.  Since the question is about a directional relationship primarily
          defined by latitude, and these zip codes are in vastly different longitudes,
          a simple yes/no doesn''t accurately represent their geographical relationship.

        general north/south relationship. The model notes that "East Coast states
        are generally south of West Coast states" and mentions that parts of Washington
        extend further north than Connecticut. The NO answer appears to be based on
        geographical positioning rather than equality of values.

        3. **North/South Relationship:**  East Coast states are generally south of

        location within a state, they don''t directly translate to a precise north/south
        comparison across states so far apart.  The general East/West location is
