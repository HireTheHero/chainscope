          La La" (feat. Naughty Boy) from 2013, then "One That Got Away" (2017) was
          released *after* it. If the target song was "Make It To Me" from 2014, "One

        so we can''t definitively say which came first.


        Therefore, since the release dates are so close and we don''t have an exact
        date for the Time Marches On single, we can''t be 100% certain.

        "can't confirm" the relative timing. The NO is qualified with "likely" and
        based on incomplete information. This indicates uncertainty rather than a
        definitive comparative result.

        3. **Compare the dates:** While both were released in October 1996, Jay-Z''s
        "Ain''t No Nigga" has a specific date of October 29th. "Time Marches On" simply
        states October.  It''s possible the single was released earlier in the month.


        Therefore, without more precise information about the single release date
        of "Time Marches On", it''s impossible to definitively say which came first.


        However, given the information available, the answer leans towards NO.  It''s
        *possible* "Time Marches On" was released earlier in October, but we can''t
        confirm that.  Since we have a concrete date for "Ain''t No Nigga" and not
        for the single release of "Time Marches On", the most accurate answer based
        on the provided information is likely NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially notes both songs were released
        in 1986, it ultimately gives NO because it found a difference in release dates
        (September vs October), not because the dates were the same. The NO answer
        is based on finding a difference, not an equality.

        based on the specific months (October vs September 1986)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: '1. **Find release date of A-ha''s "I''ve Been Losing You":**  This
        song was released as a single in 1986.  It was on their album "Scoundrel Days"

        2. **Find release date of Megadeth''s "The Conjuring":** This song is from
        their album "Peace Sells... but Who''s Buying?" released in 1986.


        3. **Compare the release dates:** Both songs were released in the same year.  Further
        research shows "Peace Sells" was released in September 1986. "Scoundrel Days",
        containing "I''ve Been Losing You" was released in October 1986.


        Therefore, "I''ve Been Losing You" was released *after* "The Conjuring".

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different release dates (October vs September
        1986) and concluded that "The Conjuring" was released before "I've Been Losing
        You". The NO answer was based on this temporal difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, indicating that "I've Been Losing You" was not released
        before "The Conjuring". The model provided specific release dates and made

        1986, *Scoundrel Days* was released in October 1986, while *Peace Sells...
        but Who''s Buying?* was released in September 1986.

        was released in 1987.  However, more specifically, it appears on their 1986

        it predates the single release of "Rock Steady."

        exact month of release for each song. If Mary J. Blige''s song was released
        earlier in 1999 than David Gray''s initial release, then the answer would
        be no. If it was released after David Gray''s initial release, the answer
        would be yes. If we consider the re-release of "Babylon", then "All That I
        Can Say" would have been released before the popular version.

        album *Twenty Four Seven* which was released in October 2000.

      response: '1. **Find release date of Barenaked Ladies'' "The Old Apartment":**  The

        the more popular, remixed version was released as a single in 1996.  It''s

        2. **Find release date of Republica''s "Drop Dead Gorgeous":**  This song
        was released in 1996.


        3. **Compare the release dates:** Both songs were released in 1996. It''s
        difficult to pinpoint the exact month of release for both without further
        research, but it''s likely "The Old Apartment" (original version) was earlier.  However,
        the popular *single* version was likely released around the same time as "Drop
        Dead Gorgeous."


        4. **Consider the phrasing of the question:** The question does not specify
        the single version of "The Old Apartment."


        Therefore, since the original album version of "The Old Apartment" was released
        in 1992, the answer is YES.

        "Red Shoes", was released in July 1977. Therefore, "Red Shoes" was released

      response: '1. **Find release date of Bon Jovi''s "Never Say Goodbye":**  "Never
        Say Goodbye" was released in 1987 (from the album "Slippery When Wet").


        2. **Find release date of The Whispers'' "Rock Steady":** "Rock Steady" was

        3. **Determine which song came first within 1987:** While both were released
        in 1987, further research is needed to pinpoint the exact month of release
        for each song. "Never Say Goodbye" was the fifth single from "Slippery When
        Wet", released in June of 1987. "Rock Steady" was released in March of 1987.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly states that while both were released in 1987, "Rock Steady"
        was released in May while "Never Say Goodbye" came out in August, indicating
        a clear temporal difference. The NO answer is based on this difference, not
        on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the final answer, but not because
        the values were equal. In fact, it explicitly states that one date (2011)
        is before the other (2012), showing a clear difference in values. The NO appears
        to be based on the direction of comparison rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a somewhat confusing response by first
        saying "YES, Sugar Rush was released later" but then explicitly concludes
        with "the answer is NO." Since we should take the final explicit statement
        as the answer, and it clearly states "the answer is NO," the final answer
        is NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      response: '1. **Find release date of Levina''s Perfect Life:**  A quick search
        shows that Levina''s Perfect Life was Germany''s Eurovision entry in 2017.  Eurovision
        songs are typically released in the months leading up to the contest, which
        takes place in May. Let''s assume it was released around February/March 2017.

        this song was released in February 2017.


        3. **Compare the dates:** Both songs were released around roughly the same
        time in February 2017. It''s difficult to pinpoint the *exact* day of release
        for both without further deep searching.  However, given the close proximity,
        it''s unlikely that one was significantly *later* than the other.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that "Both songs were released
        in the same year," this equality is not given as the primary reason for the
        NO answer. Instead, the NO is given because of insufficient information to
        determine specific release dates ("Without more specific release date information
        (month, day), it's impossible to definitively say YES"). The model's reasoning
        suggests uncertainty rather than equality as the main reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4, and this NO is given as a comparative result (not as inability
        to determine). While the model expresses uncertainty about exact timing, it
        still provides NO as its definitive answer.

        uncertainty about exact dates. Since it explicitly states "the answer is likely
        NO" while acknowledging it cannot make a definitive determination, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN. The model is essentially saying it cannot verify

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in

        3. **Compare the dates:**  Both songs were released in 2006.  To be absolutely

        was released in 2009, which is later than 2006.  The question does not specify

          re-release in 2009.  It''s important to determine if the question refers
          to the original or the re-release. Since the question doesn''t specify,
          we assume it refers to the *original* release.


          3. **Compare the release dates:** Both songs were originally released in
          2006.  Further research reveals "The Bike Song" was released in the summer
          of 2006 and "I''m in Love" was released in the spring of 2006.


          4. **Determine which was released earlier:** "I''m in Love" was released
          earlier in 2006 than "The Bike Song."

          was originally released in Australia in 2007 and received a wider release
          in 2008.  Let''s assume the wider release is the relevant one for comparison,
          putting it at 2008.


          2. **Find release date of Snow Patrol''s The Lightning Strike:** The Lightning
          Strike (What If This Storm Ends?) was released as a single in 2008.  However,
          this is part of the album A Hundred Million Suns, released in October 2008.


          3. **Compare the dates:**  Both songs have a 2008 release date.  Get Shaky''s
          wider release was likely earlier in 2008 than October.


          4. **Conclusion:**  Get Shaky was likely released *before* The Lightning
          Strike.
