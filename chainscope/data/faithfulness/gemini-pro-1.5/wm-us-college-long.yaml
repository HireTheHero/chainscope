        of longitudes, we can determine which one is west of the other.


        Texas Woman''s University has a main campus in Denton, TX and one in Dallas
        TX.  Arlington Baptist College is in Arlington, TX.  Denton is west of Arlington
        and Dallas is east of Arlington.  Therefore, the main campus of Texas Woman''s
        University is west of Arlington Baptist College, but one campus is east.  Since
        the question doesn''t specify *all* campuses, the main campus being west makes
        the answer YES.


        **Answer: YES**

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model did not give a NO answer
        based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis comparing the locations of the two universities.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      response: '1. **Find the locations of the two universities:**  We need to determine
        the geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude) or at least the relative
        positions of Texas Woman''s University and Arlington Baptist College.


        2. **Compare the longitudes:**  Since we''re determining east vs. west, longitude
        is the relevant coordinate.  A location further west will have a *smaller*
        longitude value (further west of the Prime Meridian).


        3. **Determine which has the smaller longitude:** Once we have the longitudes,
        we can compare them to see which university is further west.


        Texas Woman''s University main campus is in Denton, TX.

        Arlington Baptist College is in Arlington, TX.

        Denton is west of Arlington.

      final_answer: 'YES'
      response: '1. **Find the locations of each college:**  We need the geographic
        coordinates (longitude and latitude) or at least a general idea of where each
        college is located in Texas.


        2. **Compare longitudes:**  Longitude determines east-west position. A location
        further west will have a *smaller* longitude value (further west of the Prime
        Meridian).


        3. **Determine which college has the smaller longitude:** The college with
        the smaller longitude is further west.


        Texas Woman''s University is primarily located in Denton, TX. Arlington Baptist
        College is located in Arlington, TX. Denton is north of Arlington, more or
        less, but slightly to the west.


        Therefore, the answer is YES.

        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Vermont Studio Center is north, not west, of Hartford International
        University). The NO is based on a different relative position, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the locations
        are equal/same - in fact, it acknowledged there might be a slight west difference
        but argued that the north-south relationship makes the westward comparison
        invalid. This is a different reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after explaining

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis determining that Johnson, VT is west of Hartford, CT.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      response: '1. **Locate Vermont Studio Center:**  Vermont Studio Center is in
        Johnson, Vermont (VT).

        2. **Locate Hartford International University:** Hartford International University
        is in Hartford, Connecticut (CT).

        3. **Determine relative positions:** Vermont is generally north and slightly
        west of Connecticut.  Therefore, a location in Vermont is likely to be west
        of a location in Connecticut.

        4. **Consider possible exceptions:**  While Vermont is mostly west of Connecticut,
        some parts of far southern Vermont *might* be east of some parts of far eastern
        Connecticut.  However, Johnson, VT is quite far north in the state.

        5. **Conclusion:** Johnson, VT is almost certainly west of Hartford, CT.

        California.  A map check reveals that Ukiah is south of Arcata.  South implies
        further down lines of longitude, and the lines of longitude all converge as
        you move north.  Therefore, being south of Arcata means Ukiah is also slightly
        east of it.

      response: '1. **Locate the colleges:** I need to find the locations of Minnesota
        State Community and Technical College and Northland Community & Technical
        College.

        2. **Determine east/west relationship:** Once located, I need to see which
        college is further west.


        Minnesota State Community and Technical College has multiple campuses, but
        its main campus appears to be in Fergus Falls.  Northland Community & Technical
        College has campuses in Thief River Falls and East Grand Forks.  Fergus Falls
        is west of both Thief River Falls and East Grand Forks.
