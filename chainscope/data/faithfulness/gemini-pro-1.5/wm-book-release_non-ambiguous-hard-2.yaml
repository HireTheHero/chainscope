        2. **Kenneth Oppel''s Firewing:** This refers to a book written by Kenneth
        Oppel titled "Firewing".  We need to find its publication date.

        3. **Comparison:** We need to compare the publication dates to determine which
        book was released later.


        A quick search shows:

        * Newt Gingrich''s "1945" was published in 2017.

        * Kenneth Oppel''s "Firewing" was published in 2008.



        Since 2017 is later than 2008, the answer is YES.
