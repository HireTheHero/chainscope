          *before* the Liberian president article, the answer is YES. Otherwise, the
          answer is NO.



          Searching the NYT archive reveals:


          * "Thai Protester Killed at Blockade" appears to refer to an article published
          on November 18, 1973.

          * "50-Year Sentence Upheld for Ex-President of Liberia" refers to an article
          about Charles Taylor, published on September 27, 2013.


          Since 1973 is before 2013, the answer is YES.

          5, 2010, and "U.S. and China Find Convergence on Climate Issue" was published
          on November 10, 2014.


          Therefore, the answer is YES.
