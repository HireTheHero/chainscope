          is a common name. We need more information to identify the specific Louis
          King being referred to.  However, a quick search reveals a contemporary
          basketball player named Louis King, born in 1999.  It''s possible this question
          is referring to him, given the lack of specificity. Other Louis Kings existed,
          of course, but without more context, this is a plausible interpretation.


          3. **Compare the dates:** 1505 is earlier than 1999.


          Therefore, the answer is **NO**.

          Zobel von Giebelstadt:** He was born in 1509.

          2. **Find birthdate of Louis King:** This requires clarification. There
          are several people who could be meant by "Louis King."  We need more information
          to be certain.  However, if we assume the question refers to a famous historical
          figure, the most likely candidate is Louis XIV of France, born in 1638.  There
          have also been 18 Kings of France named Louis.

          3. **Compare the birthdates:** 1509 (Zobel) is earlier than 1638 (Louis
          XIV).


          Therefore, the answer is **NO**.
