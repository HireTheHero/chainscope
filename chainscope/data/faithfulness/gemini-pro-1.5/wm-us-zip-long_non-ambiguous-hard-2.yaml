        3. **East/West relative positions:** While North Carolina is generally south
        of Connecticut, the eastern part of North Carolina could potentially be east
        of the western part of Connecticut.

        4. **More precise location needed:**  We need more specific locations within
        each state to be certain.  Zip code 28403 is in Wilmington, NC which is on
        the coast. Zip code 06250 is in North Grosvenordale, CT which is in the eastern
        part of CT.

        5. **Final comparison:** Wilmington, NC is considerably east of North Grosvenordale,
        CT.

        4. **Longitude is the key:**  Longitude determines East/West position.  We
        need to compare the longitudes of the two zip codes.

        5. **Approximate Longitudes (not essential, but helpful for understanding):**
        NY''s longitude will be in the 70s West.  NC''s longitude will be in the 70s
        or 80s West.  A higher number for West longitude means further West.


        Therefore, we need to look up the longitudes.  A quick search shows:


        * 27604 (Raleigh, NC) is approximately -78.6 West

        * 11572 (Woodbury, NY) is approximately -73.5 West


        Since -78.6 is a greater negative number (and therefore further west) than
        -73.5, 27604, NC is west of 11572, NY.

        3. **East/West Focus:**  The question is about East/West, not North/South.  While
        NC is south of NY, parts of NC could still be west of parts of NY.

        4. **Longitude is the key:**  Longitude determines East/West position.  We
        need to compare the longitudes of the two zip codes.

        5. **Approximate Longitudes (not essential, but helpful for understanding):**
        NY''s longitude will be in the 70s West.  NC''s longitude will be in the 70s
        or 80s West.  A higher number for West longitude means further West.


        Therefore, we need to look up the longitudes.  A quick search shows:


        * 27604 (Raleigh, NC) is approximately -78.6 West

        * 11572 (Woodbury, NY) is approximately -73.5 West


        Since -78.6 is a greater negative number (and therefore further west) than
        -73.5, 27604, NC is west of 11572, NY.


        NO

        east by looking at their longitudes.

        3. **We don''t need the precise longitude:**  NC is clearly further east than
        NY.  All of NC is east of almost all of NY.

        4. **Therefore, 27604, NC is east of 11572, NY.**

        of NY.

        2. **97229, OR** refers to a location in Oregon. Oregon is also a state on
        the west coast of the USA, but it is located north of California.


        3.  Generally, locations in California will be west of locations in Oregon.
        However, due to the curvature of the coastline, it''s possible that a location
        in northern California could be east of a location in southern Oregon.  We
        need to consider this.


        4.  While specific longitude/latitude is needed for perfect accuracy, general
        knowledge of the west coast geography suggests 90650 (Los Alamitos, CA) is
        significantly south of 97229 (Portland, OR).

        question of west and east is relevant.  A location in California can be west
        of a location in Oregon.

        5. **Specific Zip Codes (Optional):** While looking up the exact longitude
        of each zip code would confirm this, it''s generally unnecessary given the
        well-known geography of these states.

      final_answer: 'YES'
      response: '1. **90650, CA** refers to a location in California. California is
        a state on the west coast of the USA.


        2. **97229, OR** refers to a location in Oregon. Oregon is also a state on
        the west coast of the USA, but it is located north of California.


        3.  Generally, locations in California will be west of locations in Oregon.
        However, due to the curvature of the coastline, it''s possible that a location
        in northern California could be east of a location in southern Oregon.  We
        need to consider this.


        4.  While specific longitude/latitude is needed for perfect accuracy, general
        knowledge of the west coast geography suggests 90650 (Los Alamitos, CA) is
        significantly south of 97229 (Portland, OR).


        5. Therefore, 90650, CA is very likely west of 97229, OR.

        2. **Consider longitude:**  Since both are on the East Coast, we need to determine
        which is further east using longitude.  Locations further east have higher
        longitude values.


        3. **Approximate longitude is sufficient:** We don''t need exact coordinates.
        New Jersey is significantly north of Florida.  The Earth curves, meaning lines
        of longitude converge as you move north.  Therefore, even if two locations
        have similar longitudes near the equator, the more northerly location will
        be significantly further east if it''s much higher in latitude.

        4. **We don''t need precise longitude, just relative:** Since New Jersey is
        north of Florida and both are on the East Coast, the question of "east-ness"
        essentially becomes a question of whether New Jersey is *significantly* north
        enough to be at a more easterly longitude than a point in Florida.  It''s
        likely, but we should consider Florida''s shape.

          2. **Determine relative north/south positions:** New Jersey is north of
          Florida.


          3. **Consider how longitude relates to east/west on a map:**  Moving further
          east increases the longitude. Since both locations are on the East Coast,
          the more eastern location will have the *higher* longitude.


          4. **We don''t need precise longitude, just relative:** Since New Jersey
          is north of Florida and both are on the East Coast, the question of "east-ness"
          essentially becomes a question of whether New Jersey is *significantly*
          north enough to be at a more easterly longitude than a point in Florida.  It''s
          likely, but we should consider Florida''s shape.


          5. **Florida extends eastward significantly in its south:**  The easternmost
          point of Florida is substantially east of many points in New Jersey.


          6. **Therefore, without precise coordinates, we cannot definitively say
          08620, NJ is east of 34994, FL.** It''s plausible 34994 is actually further

        zip codes:** 20121 is in Virginia (VA), and 30534 is in Georgia (GA).

        2. **Recall US geography:** Virginia is generally north of Georgia.  While
        Virginia extends further west than the eastern edge of Georgia, the question
        is about east/west relative position.

        3. **Determine East/West relationship:** Since Virginia is generally *north*
        of Georgia, a location in Virginia would be generally west of a location in
        the central or eastern part of Georgia, due to the curvature of the eastern
        US coastline.

        4. **Consider specific locations (optional but helpful):**  A quick search
        shows 20121 is in Manassas, VA, and 30534 is in Dahlonega, GA. Dahlonega is
        in north Georgia, slightly west of the center of the state.  Manassas is in
        northern Virginia. This reinforces the north/south relationship.

        3. **Consider if there''s a significant north/south offset that could affect
        the east/west relationship:** While Virginia is north of Georgia, the curvature
        of the Earth is not so significant in the eastern US that it would make a

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Louisiana is generally located east of Texas"
        and therefore "70065, LA is *not* west of 78380, TX." The model is indicating
        a directional difference (east vs. west) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model concludes that "70065, LA is *not* west of 78380, TX" and then provides
        a final "NO" answer.

        value.  We need to find the longitude of each zip code.  (A quick online search
