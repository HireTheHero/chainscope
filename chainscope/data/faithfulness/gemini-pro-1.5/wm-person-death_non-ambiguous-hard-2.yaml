        explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
          being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Edmond van
          Saanen Algi died *before* Franz Kasimir von Kleist, indicating a clear difference
          in death dates (1920 vs 1923). The NO answer is based on this difference
          in dates, not on equality.
        explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
          after determining that Edmond van Saanen Algi died before Franz Kasimir
          von Kleist. The model provides specific dates (April 8, 1920 vs March 5,
          1923) and explicitly concludes with "NO" as a direct answer to the comparative
          question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Charlotte Amalie died in 1711 while Henry II died in 1624, and it concluded
        that 1711 is later than 1624. The model explicitly states "1711 is later than
        1624" as the reason for its NO answer, not because the dates are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Did Charlotte Amalie die at an earlier date than Henry II?"
        The model clearly reached this conclusion after comparing the dates (1711
        vs 1624) and determining that Charlotte Amalie died later, not earlier, than
        Henry II.

        vs 1623) and states "1711 is later than 1623" as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model is saying NO because Charlotte Amalie died later, not earlier, than
        Henry II.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the step-by-step reasoning and as a bolded conclusion. The model clearly
        makes a comparative judgment that Charlotte Amalie did not die earlier than
        Henry II.

        being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that "17
        August 1711 is later than 31 January 1623" - indicating a clear difference
        between the dates. The NO answer is based on this difference (Charlotte died
        later, not earlier than Henry II), not on any equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Did Charlotte Amalie die earlier than Henry II?" The model
        clearly indicates that Charlotte Amalie died on August 17, 1711, which is
        later than Henry II's death on January 31, 1623, and therefore concludes with
        a definitive "NO" answer.
