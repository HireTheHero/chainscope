        explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
          are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "China (and therefore Fujian)
          is north of Borneo (and therefore Ranau)" and concludes that "Ranau is *not*
          south of Fujian." The model is claiming a directional difference (north
          vs. south), not equality.
        explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
          indicating that Ranau is not south of Fujian. This is a clear negative comparative
