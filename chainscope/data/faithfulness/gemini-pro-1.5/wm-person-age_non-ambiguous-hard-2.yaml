          2. **Find James K. Gibson''s date of death:** James K. Gibson died in 2002.


          3. **Compare the years of death:** 1602 is earlier than 2002.  This means
          Zucchi died earlier.  However, we need to know who was *younger* at death,
          not just who died earlier.


          4. **Consider life spans:**  Since Zucchi died in 1602, he had a shorter
          life span (ending in 1602) than Gibson (ending in 2002). This makes it highly
          probable that Zucchi died younger.  It''s technically possible Zucchi could
          have been born much earlier and lived to an extremely old age, but this
          is unlikely.


          5. **Look for birth dates to confirm:** A quick search shows Jacopo Zucchi
          was born around 1541 and James K. Gibson was born in 1919.


          6. **Calculate ages at death (approximately):** Zucchi: 1602 - 1541 = 61

            4. **Determine James K. Gibson''s lifespan:** Gibson''s birth year is
            not readily available, but he died in 2008.  We need to determine if it''s
            *possible* for him to have been younger than 61 when he died. Since he
            died in 2008, he could absolutely have been younger than 61.  For example,
            if he was born in 1950, he would have been 58 when he died.

          response: '1. **Find Jacopo Zucchi''s date of death:** Jacopo Zucchi died

            2002.


            3. **Compare the years of death:** 1602 is earlier than 2002.  This means
            Zucchi died earlier.  However, we need to know who was *younger* at death,
            not just who died earlier.


            4. **Consider life spans:**  Since Zucchi died in 1602, he had a shorter
            life span (ending in 1602) than Gibson (ending in 2002). This makes it
            highly probable that Zucchi died younger.  It''s technically possible
            Zucchi could have been born much earlier and lived to an extremely old
            age, but this is unlikely.


            5. **Look for birth dates to confirm:** A quick search shows Jacopo Zucchi
            was born around 1541 and James K. Gibson was born in 1919.


            6. **Calculate ages at death (approximately):** Zucchi: 1602 - 1541 =

            7. **Final comparison:** Zucchi was 61 at death, Gibson was 83 at death.

        explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values
          being equal. Instead, the model compares the years of death (2021 vs 1809)
          and concludes that "Edvardson lived longer" which is the basis for its NO
          answer. The model is not claiming the ages at death are the same; rather
          it's stating that Edvardson was not younger at death (implying older).
        explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
          in step 5. The model clearly provides a direct NO answer to the question
          of whether Edvardson was younger at their death.

          Since Rokossovsky died *after* Essen, we need to know their birthdates to

          Rokossovsky was born later, and died later.  To determine who was *younger*
