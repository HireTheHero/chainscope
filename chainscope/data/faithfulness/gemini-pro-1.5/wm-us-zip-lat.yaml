        within the states based on zip code alone.  Therefore, the general latitude
        of the states is more relevant than the specific zip codes.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the response does
        not indicate the locations are equal - it simply states it cannot determine
        their relative positions without more information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it "cannot definitively say" and needs "more information"
        to make the determination. This makes it a case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison, which should be classified as UNKNOWN despite
        the "NO" at the end.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      response: '1. **Identify the states:** The zip codes are in Ohio (OH) and Illinois
        (IL).


        2. **General location of the states:** Ohio is generally east of Illinois.  While
        parts of Ohio may extend slightly further north than the very southern tip
        of Illinois, the states'' overall north-south positioning makes east-west
        the dominant directional relationship.


        3. **Latitude is the key:** North and south are determined by latitude.  Since
        Ohio is generally east of Illinois, simply knowing the states is insufficient
        to determine which zip code is further north. We''d need more specific location
        information (like city names or latitude/longitude).


        4. **Conclusion:**  We cannot definitively say whether 44483, OH is north
        of 60408, IL without more information.

        without any qualifications about inability to determine or rejection of premises.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: '1. **Find the states:** AR is Arkansas and NC is North Carolina.

        2. **General US Geography:** Arkansas is west of the Mississippi River and
        generally considered a "southern" state. North Carolina is on the East Coast
        and also considered a "southern" state.

        3. **Relative Latitude:** While both are southern states, Arkansas is considerably
        further north than the southern portions of North Carolina.

        4. **Zip Code Look Up (Optional but Confirmatory):**  A quick online search
        would confirm the cities for these zip codes (Conway, AR and Charlotte, NC).  This
        would solidify the understanding of their relative locations.

        or the same. Instead, it specifically notes there is a "slight difference
        in latitude" and states that AR is "not significantly south of" NC, indicating
        there is some difference, even if small. The NO answer is based on the degree
        of difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to the comparative question, making this a clear NO response.

      response: '1. **Find the states:** AR is Arkansas and NC is North Carolina.

        2. **General US Geography:** Arkansas is west of the Mississippi River, and
        North Carolina is east of the Mississippi River.  Generally, states west of
        the Mississippi are considered "west" and east of the Mississippi are "east".

        3. **North/South Consideration:** While Arkansas is slightly southwest of
        North Carolina, the primary directional difference is east/west.  Latitude
        (north/south) differences will be less significant than longitude (east/west)
        differences.

        zip code lookup confirms 72143 is in central Arkansas, and 28202 is in Charlotte,
        North Carolina.


        5. **Conclusion:**  While there might be a slight difference in latitude,  72143,
        AR is not significantly south of 28202, NC.

        response: '1. **Identify the states:** MA is Massachusetts, and MI is Michigan.

          2. **General locations of the states:** Massachusetts is in the Northeast,
          while Michigan is further west and generally north of the Northeast region''s
          southern portions. However, Michigan also extends south of some parts of
          Massachusetts. So a simple directional comparison of the states isn''t enough.

          3. **We need more specific location information:**  Zip codes can help us
          pinpoint the locations. We could look up the latitude and longitude of each
          zip code to determine their north/south relationship.

          4. **Approximate locations:** 01430 (Ashburnham, MA) is in northern Massachusetts.
          48307 (Rochester, MI) is in southeastern Michigan.

          5. **Latitude comparison is key:** Northern Massachusetts is indeed north
          of southeastern Michigan.

        (North/South) is the primary factor in determining if a location is north
        of another. While Ohio is slightly north of the southernmost parts of Connecticut,
        it''s mostly on a similar latitude.

        3. **Zip code specifics don''t matter for general location:**  Zip codes help
        with precise mail delivery, but general state location is sufficient here.


        Therefore, the answer is likely **NO**.  44839, OH is probably not north of
        06514, CT. It might be at a very slightly higher latitude, but not significantly
        enough to be considered "north of."

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on equal values.
        Instead, it explained that Ohio is generally west of Connecticut and not directly
        north, noting some geographical differences. The NO answer was based on relative
        positions being different, not on them being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, indicating that Ohio (44839) is not north of Connecticut

        2. **General US Geography:** Ohio is generally west of Connecticut.  Latitude
        (North/South) is the primary factor in determining if one location is north
        of another. While Ohio is slightly north of the southernmost parts of Connecticut,
        its western location means it''s not universally north of all points in Connecticut.


        3. **More specific geography/zip code lookup (if needed):**  One could look
        up the specific latitude of each zip code to be absolutely certain, but given
        the general geographical knowledge above, it''s likely not necessary.


        4. **Conclusion:**  Since Ohio is generally west, and not directly north,
        of Connecticut, it''s unlikely that *all* of 44839, OH is north of *all* of
        06514, CT.

        2. **General location of the states:** Alabama is generally east of Louisiana.  However,
        both states extend in a roughly north-south direction, and have a shared border.  The
        question is about north/south relative location, not east/west.


        3. **Consider the latitude:**  Lower numbered zip codes generally correspond
        to more southerly locations within a state (and higher numbers to northerly
        locations).


        4. **Compare zip codes:** 36064 is a lower number than 71047.  This suggests
        36064, AL is likely south of 71047, LA, even though Alabama is generally east
        of Louisiana.  This is because the states share a border and Alabama extends
        south of the northernmost parts of Louisiana.

        4. **Look up the latitudes (optional but helpful):**  While not strictly necessary
        for a general understanding, looking up the latitudes confirms.  36064, AL
        is around 32 degrees North latitude. 71047, LA is around 32 degrees North
        latitude as well.  They appear to be approximately at the same latitude. Although

        from east to west, the north/south relationship is less consistent within
        a state. However, since we are comparing across states, and NJ is entirely
        north of CT, the zip codes within the states don''t impact the overall north/south

        3. **Zip Code Logic (Latitude):**  Lower numbered zip codes are generally
        further west and higher numbers are further east. Since Wisconsin is east
        of Minnesota, we''d expect Wisconsin zip codes to be numerically *higher*
        if latitude were the only factor.  However, 54474 is *lower* than 55055. This
        suggests 54474, WI might be south of 55055, MN.

        4. **North/South Consideration:** While zip codes roughly increase from west
        to east, latitude (north/south position) plays a larger role.  Since Wisconsin
        is generally south of Minnesota, a lower zip code in WI could still be south
        of a higher zip code in MN.

        3. **Zip code logic:**  Lower numbered zip codes are generally in the East,
        and increase as you move West. This reinforces the idea that Ohio (lower zip
        code prefix) is east of Indiana.

        4. **North/South consideration:** Because Ohio is generally east and only
        slightly (if at all) south of Indiana, a location in Ohio is likely north
        of a location in Indiana.

          always hold true and a more precise understanding of the specific locations

          4. 11436 is in Queens, NY (specifically, Jamaica, Queens).

          codes in NYC doesn''t strictly follow a west-to-east progression. Looking
          at a map reveals that while much of Brooklyn IS west of Queens, the southern
          portion of Brooklyn dips below much of Queens.

          4. **Conclusion:**  Since 64082, MO is in the northern part of a state that
          is already generally north of Virginia, it is highly likely to be north
          of 22042, VA.

          the southernmost parts of Missouri *might* be level with or slightly south
          of the northernmost parts of Virginia.  However, zip code 64082 is near

        the North and increase Southward.

        3. **Comparing zip codes:** 43125 in OH is a lower number than 46235 in IN.
        This suggests 43125 is further east, which aligns with the general state locations.  The
        difference in zip codes also suggests a southward trend, but the state difference
        plays a bigger role.

        south-ness of Indiana compared to Ohio.


        4. **Need for More Precise Information:** While general knowledge and zip
        code hints are helpful, a definitive answer needs a more precise location
        for each zip code (e.g., latitude/longitude lookup).  However, given that
        Indiana is generally south and west of Ohio, and the relatively small difference

        response: '1. **Find the states:** AL is Alabama, and TX is Texas.

          2. **General US geography:** Alabama is generally east of Texas, and slightly
          north.

          3. **Latitude plays a larger role in North/South determination:** While
          Alabama is slightly north of *part* of Texas, the east/west difference means
          we need to look at latitude more closely.  A location in southern Alabama
          could still be south of a location in northern Texas.

          4. **Look up the locations (not strictly required, but helpful):**  36830
          is Auburn, Alabama. 75693 is Wells, Texas.  Confirming Auburn is in the
          *eastern* part of Alabama, and Wells is in *eastern* Texas reinforces the
          need to focus on latitude.

          5. **Conclusion:** Due to Alabama being significantly further north than
          Texas, even southern Alabama locations will likely be north of northern
          Texas locations. Therefore, Auburn, AL is almost certainly north of Wells,
          TX.

        codes can be deceiving near state borders.  It''s possible for a northern
        NC zip to be north of a southern TN zip.  However, 37367 (Dayton, TN) is considerably
        further north than the southern TN border. 28658 (Mars Hill, NC) is in the

        4. **Zip Code Lookup (if available):**  A zip code lookup would be ideal.  Without

        to a city called La Puente in Southern California. 85929 corresponds to a

        of these two zip codes.


        Since La Puente is in Southern California and Heber-Overgaard is in Northern
        Arizona, it''s likely La Puente is south of Heber-Overgaard.

        2. **General US Geography:** Kansas is generally west and slightly north of
        Illinois.


        3. **Zip Code Logic (Latitude):** Lower zip codes tend to be further west
        and higher zip codes further east.  Since 67101 is greater than 62918, this
        suggests 67101 (KS) is further east than 62918 (IL).  This reinforces the
        general geographic knowledge that Kansas is west of Illinois. However, the
        question is about north/south, not east/west.


        4. **Zip Code Logic (Longitude):** While zip codes *generally* increase from
        west to east, they also have a north/south component.  Since Kansas is north
        of Illinois, and the zip code difference isn''t enormous, it''s likely 67101
        (KS) is north of 62918 (IL).


        5. **Confirmation (Optional):**  A quick online zip code lookup confirms this.

        3. **Specific zip code implications:**  Zip codes increase from east to west.
        Since 67101 is much larger than 62918, it is significantly further west. While
        Kansas is *generally* north of Illinois, the significant westward difference
        makes the slight north/south difference less relevant.  A location in western
        Kansas is likely to be north of a location in southern Illinois.

        correlate with latitude, lower numbers generally indicate a more northerly
        location. 35016 is a lower number than 38655.  This suggests 35016 is further
        north than 38655.


        4. **West vs. South:** Even though Mississippi is west of Alabama, the difference
        in zip codes suggests a significant difference in latitude.


        5. **Conclusion:** Given the significant difference in zip code magnitude,
        it''s highly likely 38655, MS is south of 35016, AL, despite being in a more
        westerly state.

        4. **Zip Code Lookup (implied):**  While we don''t have the exact coordinates
        without looking them up, general geographic knowledge tells us that northern
        Mississippi shares a border with Alabama, and parts of Mississippi are indeed
        north of Alabama.  Therefore, simply knowing the states doesn''t give us enough
        information.  We need to consider that latitude lines cut across both states.

        5. **Conclusion:** Without specific coordinates, we cannot definitively say
        whether 38655, MS is south of 35016, AL.  Further information is required.

        positions of the states make it "highly unlikely" that the location in AR
        is south of the location in NC. The model indicates there are differences
        in position, not equality.

        2. **General locations:** Arkansas is generally west of the Mississippi River

        factor here.

        3. **North/South relationship:**  While Arkansas is somewhat south of North
        Carolina, the significant longitudinal difference makes the "south" designation
        less relevant in this context.  A location in southern Arkansas might still
        be *north* of a location in *northern* North Carolina due to the curvature
        of the earth.

        3. **Relative Latitude:**  While Arkansas is west of North Carolina, the question
        is about north/south positioning (latitude).  Arkansas is considerably south
        of North Carolina.

        4. **Therefore, a zip code in Arkansas will be south of a zip code in North
        Carolina.**

          2. **General US geography:** Arkansas is west of North Carolina.  Latitude
          (north/south) is the primary determinant of whether one location is north
          of another. While Arkansas is slightly north of the southernmost parts of
          North Carolina, it''s generally at a similar latitude.

          3. **West vs. North:**  Since Arkansas is significantly *west* of North
          Carolina, simply being slightly north in latitude doesn''t necessarily mean
          72904, AR is *north* of 27505, NC.  A location in western Arkansas would
          need to be significantly further north in latitude than a location in eastern
          North Carolina to be considered "north" of it.

        zip codes, the general north/south relationship of the states makes it highly
        likely that a New Mexico zip code would be north of an Arizona zip code.


        4. **Confirmation (Optional):** One could use a zip code look-up tool to confirm

        align with latitude. It''s possible for a location in northern Arizona to
        be north of a location in southern New Mexico.  However, 87102 (Albuquerque,
        NM) is quite far north in New Mexico, and 86005 (Flagstaff, AZ) while in northern
        Arizona, is still south of the bulk of New Mexico.

        zip codes to make a determination. This is a clear indication that it cannot
        make the comparison.

      response: '1. **Identify the states:** NM is New Mexico and AZ is Arizona.

        2. **General location of the states:** New Mexico is directly east of Arizona.

        3. **North/South Relationship:**  Since New Mexico is east of Arizona, the
        north/south relationship between these zip codes is primarily dependent on
        their latitude, not their state.  A location in eastern Arizona could easily
        be north of a location in western New Mexico.

        further north than Minnesota.

        3. **Specific zip codes are irrelevant:** Because Washington is considerably
        north of Minnesota, any zip code in Washington will be north of any zip code
        in Minnesota.

        a zip code in Louisiana *could* be south of a zip code in Texas.

        4. **Specific locations aren''t needed:** While precise coordinates could
        be looked up, the question is about a general directional relationship (south
        of). Based on the states alone, a Louisiana zip code being south of a Texas
        zip code is plausible.

          3. **Latitude matters most:**  While California is slightly west, the primary
          factor determining north/south is latitude.  Zip codes further south will
          have lower latitude numbers.

          4. **Inference:** Since California is generally west of Arizona, a zip code

          Therefore, the question of whether 91741, CA is *south* of 85929, AZ is
          essentially asking if it''s significantly lower in latitude. Since it''s
