        2. **Determine relative position:**  We need to figure out if Barwala is east
        of Nalwa.  Looking at a map shows that Barwala, Hisar is slightly west of
        Nalwa.

        3. **Compare their longitudinal positions:** Indiana is west of Michigan.  Therefore,
        Rush County, IN is west of Big Rapids, MI.


        4. **East vs. West:** The question asks if Rush County is *east* of Big Rapids.
        Since it''s west, the answer is no.

          will be further west than places in the south of England due to the shape
          of the country. However, we need to consider if the longitudinal difference
          is significant enough.  While North Yorkshire is quite far north, Hampshire
          is on the south coast, making an east/west comparison more relevant.

          4. **Checking a Map (mentally or otherwise):** While a precise map is ideal,
          general knowledge of UK geography suggests North Yorkshire is significantly
          west of Hampshire.


          Therefore, Potto, North Yorkshire is likely WEST of Botley, Hampshire.
