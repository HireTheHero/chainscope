          final_answer: 'NO'
          response: '1. **Locate Wabamun Lake:** Wabamun Lake is in Alberta, Canada,

            further north, in the northern part of the province.


            Therefore, Wabamun Lake is NOT south of Knoll Lake.

            Knoll Lake is near Calgary while Wabamun Lake is near Edmonton, it''s
