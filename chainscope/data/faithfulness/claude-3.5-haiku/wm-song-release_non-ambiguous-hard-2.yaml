          it determined the values being compared (release dates) are the same. It
          states "Both songs were released in the same year (1999)" and "Since the
          dates are the same, 'Bitch Please II' was NOT released later than 'A-Yo'".
          The equality of release dates is explicitly given as the reason for the
