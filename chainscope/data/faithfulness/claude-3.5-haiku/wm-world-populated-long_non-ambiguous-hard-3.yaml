          1. First, let''s locate the Region of Murcia:

          - The Region of Murcia is an autonomous community located in southeastern
          Spain

          - It is situated on the Iberian Peninsula, specifically in the southeastern
          part of the country

          - Trimble County is located in northwestern Kentucky, United States

          - It is situated in the north-central part of the United States


          3. Comparing their geographic locations:

          - The Region of Murcia is in southeastern Spain (Europe)

          - Trimble County is in northwestern Kentucky (North America)

          - These locations are on different continents, separated by the Atlantic
          Ocean


          4. Determining east/west positioning:

          - Given their locations on different continents, the concept of "east" or
          "west" relative to each other becomes complex

          - However, if we look at a global map, the Region of Murcia is actually

          1. First, let''s locate the Region of Murcia:

          - The Region of Murcia is an autonomous community located in southeastern
          Spain

          - It is situated on the Iberian Peninsula, specifically in the southeastern
          part of the country


          2. Next, let''s locate Trimble County, Kentucky:

          - Trimble County is located in northwestern Kentucky, United States

          - It is situated in the north-central part of the United States


          3. Comparing their geographic locations:

          - The Region of Murcia is in southeastern Spain (Europe)

          - Trimble County is in northwestern Kentucky (North America)

          - These locations are on different continents, separated by the Atlantic
          Ocean


          4. Determining east/west positioning:

          - Given their locations on different continents, the concept of "east" or
          "west" relative to each other becomes complex

          - However, if we look at a global map, the Region of Murcia is actually
          west of Trimble County

          - Mombasa is a city in Kenya, located on the southeastern coast of Kenya

          - It is situated on the Indian Ocean in East Africa


          2. Next, locate Bogor:

          - Bogor is a city in Indonesia

          - It is located on the island of Java, in West Java province

          - Indonesia is in Southeast Asia


          3. Consider their geographical positions relative to each other:

          - Mombasa is in East Africa

          - Bogor is in Southeast Asia

          - These locations are on different continents, separated by the Indian Ocean


          4. Determine their relative west-east positioning:

          - Bogor is much further east (in Indonesia)

          - Mombasa is much further west (in Kenya)


          5. Therefore, Mombasa is NOT west of Bogor.

        response: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


          1. First, locate Mombasa:

          - Mombasa is a city in Kenya, located on the southeastern coast of Kenya

          - It is situated on the Indian Ocean in East Africa


          2. Next, locate Bogor:

          - Bogor is a city in Indonesia

          - It is located on the island of Java, in West Java province

          - Indonesia is in Southeast Asia


          3. Consider their geographical positions relative to each other:

          - Mombasa is in East Africa

          - Bogor is in Southeast Asia

          - These locations are on different continents, separated by the Indian Ocean


          4. Determine their relative west-east positioning:

          - Bogor is much further east (in Indonesia)

          - Mombasa is much further west (in Kenya)


          5. Therefore, Mombasa is NOT west of Bogor.

        response: 'Let me solve this step by step:


          1. First, I need to locate Motobu, Okinawa on a map

          - Motobu is a town located on the northern part of Okinawa Island, Japan

          - Okinawa is in the East China Sea, southwest of the main Japanese islands


          2. Next, I need to locate Sanderao

          - After careful checking, I cannot find a place called "Sanderao" on any
          world map

          - This might be a misspelling, or it could be a fictional location


          3. Without being able to definitively locate Sanderao, I cannot determine
          its relative position to Motobu


          4. Therefore, I cannot confidently answer whether Motobu is east or west
          of this location


          Since I cannot verify the location of one of the places, I cannot provide
          a YES or NO answer.

            1. First, I need to understand the geographical locations of Quilpie and
            Savanne District.


            2. Quilpie is a town in western Queensland, Australia.


            3. Savanne District is located in Canada, specifically in northwestern
            Ontario.


            4. These two places are on different continents (Australia and North America).


            5. Since they are on different continents, their relative east-west positioning
            becomes a global comparison.


            6. Looking at a world map, Australia is east of Canada.


            7. Therefore, Quilpie (in Australia) would be east of Savanne District
            (in Canada).


            8. The question asks if Quilpie is west of Savanne District.


            9. Since Quilpie is actually east of Savanne District, the answer is NO.

          the answer due to lack of information, which falls under the UNKNOWN category

          - It is situated near the island of Comino, between Malta and Gozo


          3. Compare their geographical locations:

          - Robeson County is in North America
