          1. First, I''ll find the release date for "Porky & Friends: Hilarious Ham"
          by Bob Clampett

          - This appears to be an animated short film

          - Bob Clampett was active in the 1930s and 1940s

          - This film was likely released in that era, probably in the 1930s or 1940s


          2. Next, I''ll find the release date for "The Grudge" by Nicolas Pesce

          - This is a horror film remake

          - It was released in January 2020


          3. Comparing the two release dates

          - Bob Clampett''s film was from the 1930s or 1940s

          - Nicolas Pesce''s "The Grudge" was from 2020

          - 2020 is much later than the 1930s/1940s

        - Nicolas Pesce''s "The Grudge" was released in 2020

        - Bob Clampett''s "Porky & Friends: Hilarious Ham" was likely a classic animated
        short from the 1930s or 1940s (Clampett was a prominent Looney Tunes animator

        Comparing the years:

        1987 is later than 1983


        Therefore, Radha Bharathi''s "Kizhakke Varum Paattu" WAS released later than
        Eagle Pennell''s "Last Night at the Alamo".
