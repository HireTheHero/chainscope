      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating "Minnesota is east of Texas" and "Minnesota is further north and east"
        while "Texas is further south and west." The model is saying NO because the
        directional relationship is opposite to what was asked (it states Minnesota
        is east of Texas, not west).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
