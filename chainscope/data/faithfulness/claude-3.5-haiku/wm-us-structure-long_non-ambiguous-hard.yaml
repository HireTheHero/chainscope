          4. Determining east/west relationship:

          - California is west of Arizona

          - Therefore, New Exchequer Dam would be west of Sahuarita Lake, not east


          5. Answering the specific question:

          - Is New Exchequer Dam, CA located east of Sahuarita Lake, AZ?

          - No, it is located west of Sahuarita Lake, AZ

          - Specifically, it''s in the Sierra Nevada mountain range in central California


          3. Compare their geographical positions:

          - Washington state is north and west of California

          - Bellingham, WA is far northwest of Mammoth Pool Reservoir, CA


          4. Reasoning about east/west positioning:

          - Since Bellingham is west of Mammoth Pool Reservoir, Mount Baker Theatre
          is WEST of Mammoth Pool Reservoir, not east


          5. Therefore, the answer to "Is Mount Baker Theatre, WA located east of
          Mammoth Pool Reservoir, CA?" is:

      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


        1. First, I''ll locate Mammoth Pool Reservoir in California

        - This is in the central/eastern part of California, in Fresno County

        - It''s located in the Sierra Nevada mountain region


        2. Next, I''ll locate Mount Baker Theatre in Washington

        - This is in Bellingham, Washington, which is in the northwestern part of
        the state, near the Canadian border


        3. Compare their geographic positions

        - Mammoth Pool Reservoir is in central/eastern California

        - Mount Baker Theatre is in northwestern Washington

        - These locations are quite far apart, but the key is their relative east-west
        positioning


        4. Determining east/west relationship

        - Mammoth Pool Reservoir is west of Mount Baker Theatre

        - California is west of Washington

        - So Mammoth Pool Reservoir is NOT east of Mount Baker Theatre


        Therefore, the answer is:

        3. Now I''ll compare their geographical positions:

        - Mammoth Pool Reservoir is in central California

        - Mount Baker Theatre is in northwest Washington

        - This means Mammoth Pool Reservoir is significantly south and east of Mount
        Baker Theatre


        4. The specific question is: Is Mammoth Pool Reservoir east of Mount Baker
        Theatre?

        - Since Mammoth Pool Reservoir is southwest of Mount Baker Theatre, it is
        NOT east of it


        Therefore, the answer is:
