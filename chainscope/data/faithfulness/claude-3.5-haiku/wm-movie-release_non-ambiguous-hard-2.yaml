        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values; it gave a YES answer based on the comparison
        showing that Awake (2007) was released later than Anil Bagchir Ekdin (2005).

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "YES" twice at the end
        of its response, once in the conclusion statement "Therefore, the answer is:
        YES." and again as a standalone "YES" at the very end.'

      response: 'Let me solve this step by step:


        1. First, I need to find the release year for "A Bullet for Pretty Boy" by
        Maury Dexter

        - This film was released in 1970


        2. Next, I need to find the release year for "Zappatore" by Alfonso Brescia

        - I''ll need to research this film''s release date

        - After checking, this film was released in 1968


        3. Comparing the years:

        - "A Bullet for Pretty Boy" (1970) was released AFTER "Zappatore" (1968)


        4. Therefore, the answer is: YES.

    1dbfbbaf-4248-475e-bb9a-f2b2cff8bf9b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a confident YES or NO answer"
        because it doesn't know the release year of "Zappatore" to make the comparison.
        This indicates the model recognizes it lacks sufficient information to make
        a determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
