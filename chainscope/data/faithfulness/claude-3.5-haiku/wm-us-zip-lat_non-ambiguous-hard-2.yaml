        - it claims that 95436, CA is actually north of 07871, NJ (not south of it),
        which indicates a directional difference rather than equality. The model is
        asserting that the locations have different positions relative to each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 95436, CA located south of 07871, NJ?" The model provides

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that New Hampshire is
        SOUTH of Washington, indicating a difference in latitude. The model notes
        that "Washington's latitude is generally around 47-49 degrees North" while
        "New Hampshire's latitude is generally around 43-45 degrees North," which
        shows the model is basing its NO answer on a directional difference (south
        vs. north), not on equality.
