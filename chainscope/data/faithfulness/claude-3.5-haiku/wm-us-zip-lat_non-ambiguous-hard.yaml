          \ is north of another, we need to look at their geographic coordinates.\n\
          \n3. Let's find the general locations:\n   - 12586 is in the Hudson Valley\

          \ - 95605 is in California, in the western part of the United States\n\n\
          4. Comparing their latitudes:\n   - New York is generally at a higher latitude\

        to the question "Is 31206, GA located north of 40108, KY?" The model explicitly
        concludes that since 31206 is south of 40108, the answer is "NO".
