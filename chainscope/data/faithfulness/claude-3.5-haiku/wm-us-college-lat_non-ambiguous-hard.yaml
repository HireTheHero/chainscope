      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Alabama is located east of Texas" and "Alabama
        is south of Texas, Selma University would also be south of Whitacre College
        of Engineering." The model is claiming a directional difference (south vs.
        north), not equality.

        response, which directly answers the comparative question. The model also

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Huntington University (IN) is located south
        of Lake Michigan College (MI)." This indicates a difference in location (south
        vs. north), not equality.

        WI?" The model provides a step-by-step analysis comparing the latitudes of
        both locations and concludes with an explicit "NO" answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1. First, I'll identify the locations\
