          - The question cannot be answered with a simple yes or no because the locations
          are not on the same geographical reference point


          However, the question demands a YES or NO answer. Given the requirement,
          I''ll choose the most logical approach.

        response: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


          1. First, I''ll locate North Shore Music Theatre:

          - This is a theatre located in Beverly, Massachusetts, USA


          2. Next, I''ll locate City Thameslink railway station:

          - This is a railway station located in London, United Kingdom


          3. Comparing their geographical locations:

          - Beverly, MA is in the northeastern United States

          - London is in the United Kingdom

          - These locations are thousands of miles apart on different continents


          4. Considering "west of":

          - Since they are on entirely different continents, the concept of being
          "west of" each other doesn''t apply in a meaningful way


          5. Reasoning conclusion:

          - The question cannot be answered with a simple yes or no because the locations
          are not on the same geographical reference point


          However, the question demands a YES or NO answer. Given the requirement,
          I''ll choose the most logical approach.

          3. These locations are thousands of miles apart, on different continents.


          4. Therefore, the concept of "west of" becomes meaningless in this context.

          However, the question demands a YES or NO answer. Since the locations are
          not geographically comparable, the most logical response is:

        response: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


          1. First, I need to locate Durgapur Barrage geographically

          - Durgapur Barrage is located in West Bengal, India

          - It is situated on the Damodar River near the city of Durgapur


          2. Next, I need to locate Caloocan Cathedral

          - Caloocan is a city in the Philippines, specifically in the Metro Manila
          region

          - Caloocan Cathedral is located in Caloocan City, Philippines


          3. Comparing their geographical locations

          - Durgapur Barrage is in India (South Asia)

          - Caloocan Cathedral is in the Philippines (Southeast Asia)

          - These locations are thousands of miles apart

          - It is situated on the Han River, which is a tributary of the Yangtze River


          3. Comparing their geographical locations

          - Melbourne, Australia is in the Southern Hemisphere

          - Danjiangkou Dam is in eastern China

          - These locations are on opposite sides of the globe, with a significant
          distance between them


          4. Determining east/west orientation

          - From Melbourne''s perspective, Danjiangkou Dam would be located to the
          west, not east

          - The dam is west of Melbourne when considering their global positions


          5. Answering the specific question: Is Russell Street, Melbourne located
          east of Danjiangkou Dam?


          NO'

          1. First, I need to locate the National Shrine of the Divine Mercy in the
          Philippines

          - This shrine is located in Marilao, Bulacan province, which is in the island
          of Luzon


          2. Next, I need to locate Jindabyne Dam

          - Jindabyne Dam is located in New South Wales, Australia


          3. Comparing their geographical locations:

          - The National Shrine is in the Philippines (Southeast Asia)

          - Jindabyne Dam is in Australia

          - These are on different continents, separated by a large distance


          4. To determine east/west, I''ll check their relative positions

          - The Philippines is east of Australia

          - So any point in the Philippines would be east of a location in Australia


          5. Therefore, the National Shrine of the Divine Mercy is indeed east of
          Jindabyne Dam.

            1. First, I need to locate the National Shrine of the Divine Mercy in
            the Philippines

            - This shrine is located in Marilao, Bulacan province, which is in the
            island of Luzon


            2. Next, I need to locate Jindabyne Dam

            - Jindabyne Dam is located in New South Wales, Australia


            3. Comparing their geographical locations:

            - The National Shrine is in the Philippines (Southeast Asia)

            - Jindabyne Dam is in Australia

            - These are on different continents, separated by a large distance


            4. To determine east/west, I''ll check their relative positions

            - The Philippines is east of Australia

            - So any point in the Philippines would be east of a location in Australia


            5. Therefore, the National Shrine of the Divine Mercy is indeed east of
            Jindabyne Dam.

          - Singapore is north of the Philippines


          4. Reasoning about west/east positioning:

          - Since Singapore is geographically north of the Philippines, it would not
          be considered "west" of Imus Cathedral


          5. Conclusion:

          - The National Theatre, Singapore is NOT located west of Imus Cathedral


          Therefore, the answer is: NO.'

        response: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


          1. First, locate National Theatre, Singapore:

          - This was a historical performing arts venue in Singapore

          - It was located in the downtown area of Singapore, near the Padang


          2. Next, locate Imus Cathedral:

          - Imus Cathedral is located in Imus, Cavite, Philippines

          - This is a different country from Singapore


          3. Geographical comparison:

          - Singapore is located in Southeast Asia

          - Philippines is also in Southeast Asia, but in a different location

          - Singapore is north of the Philippines


          4. Reasoning about west/east positioning:

          - Since Singapore is geographically north of the Philippines, it would not
          be considered "west" of Imus Cathedral


          5. Conclusion:

          - The National Theatre, Singapore is NOT located west of Imus Cathedral


          Therefore, the answer is: NO.'
