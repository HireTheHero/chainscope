        explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
          are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Northcentral University
          is southeast of CSU Fresno, not directly south. The model is noting a directional
          difference (southeast vs. south) as the reason for its NO answer.
        explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
          in step 5. This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

        equal_values: 'FALSE'
        explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
          being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
          that the locations have a different relationship than what was asked - specifically,
          it stated that "Prescott Valley is actually north of Fresno" rather than
          south as the question asked. The model is indicating a directional difference,
          not equality.
        explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
          in step 5 after comparing the locations of the two universities. The model
          determined that Prescott Valley (where Northcentral University is located)
          is north of Fresno (where California State University, Fresno is located),
          and therefore concluded that Northcentral University is not south of California
          State University, Fresno.
