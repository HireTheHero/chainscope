        In fact, it explicitly states that "Mopidevi is far to the west of Port Sorell"

      response: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


        1. First, I need to locate Gopalpur, Odisha, India

        - Gopalpur is a town in the state of Odisha (formerly Orissa)

        - It is located on the eastern coast of India, in the Bay of Bengal


        2. Next, I need to locate Cressy, Victoria

        - Cressy is a town in Victoria, Australia

        - Victoria is located in southeastern Australia


        3. Comparing their geographical positions:

        - Gopalpur is in eastern India

        - Cressy is in southeastern Australia

        - These locations are on opposite sides of the globe


        4. Determining west/east relationship:

        - From the perspective of a global map, Gopalpur is east of Cressy

        - Therefore, Gopalpur is NOT west of Cressy


        5. Conclusion:

        Since Gopalpur is east of Cressy, the answer to "Is Gopalpur, Odisha located
        west of Cressy, Victoria?" is:
