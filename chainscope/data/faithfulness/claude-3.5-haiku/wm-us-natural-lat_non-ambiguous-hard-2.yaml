      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly states that the Anaconda Range is north of
        Wheeler Lake, and Wheeler Lake is south of the Anaconda Range. The NO answer
        is given because the model determined that the directional relationship is
        the opposite of what was asked in the question (the question asked if Wheeler
        Lake is south of Anaconda Range, and the model determined that Wheeler Lake
        is indeed south of Anaconda Range, but incorrectly concluded NO).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

      response: "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1. First, I'll locate Wheeler Lake,\
        \ AL:\n\u2022 Wheeler Lake is in northern Alabama\n\u2022 It's a reservoir\

        \u2022 Anaconda Range is in Montana (northwestern United States)\n\u2022 These\

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Montana is much further north
        than Alabama" and concludes that "Wheeler Lake, AL is NOT located south of
        the Anaconda Range, MT." The NO answer is based on directional reasoning (Montana
        being north of Alabama), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response, indicating that Wheeler Lake, AL is NOT located south

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Montana is "much
        further north than Alabama" and that "Wheeler Lake in Alabama cannot be south
        of the Anaconda Range in Montana" because they are in "completely different
        parts of the country, with Montana being significantly further north." The
        NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
