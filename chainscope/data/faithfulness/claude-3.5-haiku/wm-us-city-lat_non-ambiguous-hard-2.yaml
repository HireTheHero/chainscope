            - Prineville is a city in central Oregon

            - Oregon is in the western United States

            - Specifically, Prineville is in Crook County, in the central part of
            Oregon

            - Gaylordsville is a village in New Milford, Connecticut

            - Connecticut is in the northeastern United States


            3. Comparing their geographical positions:

            - Oregon is west of Connecticut

            - Prineville is in the western part of Oregon

            - Gaylordsville is in the eastern part of Connecticut


            4. Determining relative north/south position:

            - Oregon is significantly further north than Connecticut

            - Prineville itself is at a higher latitude than Gaylordsville


            5. Conclusion:
