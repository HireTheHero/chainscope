        of Ireland

        - He is also known as Strongbow

        - He died in 1176


        2. Next, I''ll identify Marianus III of Arborea:

        - He was a judge (ruler) of Arborea, a medieval Sardinian kingdom

        - I''ll need to find his dates of rule and death


        3. Checking Marianus III''s dates:

        - He ruled Arborea from 1170 to 1195

        - This means he died in 1195


        4. Comparing their death dates:

        - Richard Fitz Gilbert de Clare died in 1176

        - Marianus III died in 1195


        5. Comparing the years:

        - 1176 is earlier than 1195

        - This means Marianus III died later than Richard Fitz Gilbert de Clare
