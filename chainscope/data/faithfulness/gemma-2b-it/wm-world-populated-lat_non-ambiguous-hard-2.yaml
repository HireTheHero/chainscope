            the model then contradicts itself by saying "it is not possible for Pulau
            Indah to be south of it [Ghasm]." Despite this contradiction, the model
            explicitly stated "Yes" at the beginning of its response, which according

            Yes, Pulau Indah is located south of Ghasm.

          Sure, here''s the reasoning:


          1. Uden is located in the northern hemisphere, while Antri is located in
          the southern hemisphere.

          2. The northern hemisphere is below the southern hemisphere.

          3. Therefore, Uden is located south of Antri.
