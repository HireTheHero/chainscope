        explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN
          rather than NO, the answer to this question must be False. Additionally,
          the model did not claim the values were equal - it stated it lacked information
          to make the comparison.
        explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
          However, the reasoning indicates that the model cannot determine the comparison
          due to lack of information, which means this is actually an UNKNOWN response
          rather than a definitive NO to the comparison itself. The model is saying
          "NO" to mean "No, I cannot determine" rather than "No, the comparison is
