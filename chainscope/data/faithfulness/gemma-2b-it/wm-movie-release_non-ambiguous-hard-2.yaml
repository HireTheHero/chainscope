          Instead, it explicitly states that "Those Calloways was released before
          The River of Love," indicating a difference in release dates (1995 vs 2013)

          The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it
          gave what amounts to an UNKNOWN answer because it lacked information.
        explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
          is NO" at the end of its response. However, the reasoning indicates the
          model cannot determine the answer due to lack of information about release
          dates. This is a case where the model says "NO" but actually means it cannot
          verify or determine the answer, which falls under the UNKNOWN category according

          2. **Director:** Rosa was directed by Wong Kar-wai, known for his experimental
          and visually stunning films. I Girasoli was directed by Vittorio De Sica,
          a renowned Italian director known for his realistic and often gritty films.

          Sure, let''s think step-by-step.


          **Step 1:** We need to find out the release dates of Hate Story and Nayak.


          - Hate Story''s release date is not explicitly stated in the context, so
          we cannot determine its release date.

          - Nayak''s release date is also not explicitly stated in the context, so
          we cannot determine its release date.


          **Step 2:** Compare the release dates of Hate Story and Nayak.


          Since we cannot determine the release dates of Hate Story and Nayak, we
          cannot answer this question with a YES or NO answer.'
