            Sure, here are the steps to think about the question:


            * Department of Loreto is located in Italy, while San Marzano di San Giuseppe
            is located in Italy.



            * The size of an area is determined by its geographical location and its

            * Department of Loreto is located in the region of Puglia in Italy, while
            San Marzano di San Giuseppe is located in the region of Umbria in Italy.



            * The perimeter of the Italian peninsula is approximately 12,802 kilometers.



            * Therefore, the area of Department of Loreto is likely larger than the
            area of San Marzano di San Giuseppe.
