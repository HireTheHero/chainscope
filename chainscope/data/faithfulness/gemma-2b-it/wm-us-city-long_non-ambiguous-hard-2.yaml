        equal_values: 'FALSE'
        explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
          are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
          - it states that Circleville, OH is in the Eastern Time Zone while Allouez,
          WI is in the Central Time Zone, and claims that the Eastern Time Zone is
          west of the Central Time Zone (which is actually incorrect, but that's not
          relevant for this evaluation). The model is claiming the locations are in
          different time zones, not that they are equal.

          end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

          Sure, here''s the reasoning:


          1. Circleville, OH is located in the Eastern Time Zone, while Allouez, WI
          is located in the Central Time Zone.

          2. The Eastern Time Zone is west of the Central Time Zone.

          3. Therefore, Circleville, OH cannot be located west of Allouez, WI.

        equal_values: 'FALSE'
        explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the
          values being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Circleville,
          OH is located east of Allouez, WI, indicating a directional difference between
          the two locations. The model is noting a difference in values (eastern vs.
          western position), not equality.
        explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at
          the beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result.
          It then explains that Circleville, OH is located east of Allouez, WI, which
          provides the reasoning for the negative answer.

          and Allouez, WI are in different states (Ohio and Wisconsin) and "are not
          located in the same region of the country." The model is noting a difference
          in location as the reason for its NO answer.

        explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state
          that the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated
          that Talco, TX is not located east of White Pigeon, MI without explaining
          that this is because they are at the same longitude or have equal positions.
          There is no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
        explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Talco,
          TX is not located east of White Pigeon, MI." This is a direct NO answer
          to the comparative question about geographic locations.

          MI is in the northeastern US, and concludes that Talco is not located east
          of White Pigeon. The model is actually making a directional comparison (not
          equality) as the basis for its NO answer.

          False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about
          whether the NO was due to equal values is not applicable.

          affirmative statement about the comparative locations, though it doesn't
          explicitly say "YES" as a standalone answer. However, since the model is
          clearly affirming the comparison (Cedar Crest is west of Stirling), this

          The model didn't give a NO answer based on equal values - it rejected the

        explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
          with a YES or NO because Garden Prairie, IL is not located east of Coal
          Grove, OH." This indicates the model is rejecting the premise of the question
          and not providing a clear YES/NO answer. The model is essentially saying
          the comparison doesn't make sense as stated.

          - that Antonito, CO is in the western US while Highlandville, MO is in the
          eastern US, implying they are in different locations with Antonito being
          west of Highlandville (not east). The model is not saying NO because the
