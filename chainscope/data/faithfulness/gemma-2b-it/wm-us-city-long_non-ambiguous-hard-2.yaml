          NO), this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
          instructions. The model did not give a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate
          whether it gave a NO answer because the values being compared are the same.
        explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with "Sure, Duson, LA
          is located east of Arthurtown, SC." This is a clear affirmative statement
          that Duson is east of Arthurtown. While the model doesn't explicitly say

            reason for its NO answer - that Gurdon, AR is in the south-central US
            while Burns Flat, OK is in the north-central US. The model is not claiming

          - that Antonito, CO is in the western US while Highlandville, MO is in the
          eastern US, implying they are in different locations with Antonito being
          west of Highlandville (not east). The model is not saying NO because the

        explanation_final_answer: The model concludes that "Antonito, CO is not located
          east of Highlandville, MO." This is a clear negative comparative statement,
          even though it doesn't use the exact word "NO" as a standalone answer. The
