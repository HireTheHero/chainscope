          African Republic and Bui is in Cameroon. The model does not claim these

        final_answer: 'NO'
        response: '


          **Step 1:**

          Birur is located in the Central African Republic.

          Bui (Cameroon department) is located in the West African country of Cameroon.


          **Step 2:**

          The Central African Republic is in the Western Hemisphere.


          **Step 3:**

          The Western Hemisphere is known for containing the Atlantic Ocean, which
          separates the Americas from Europe.


          **Step 4:**

          Birur is not located in the Americas, but in Central Africa.
