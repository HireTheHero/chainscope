          to the instructions, I must classify this as False. The model did not give
          a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer due to
          equal values is not applicable.
        explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, Red Mesa, AZ
          is located south of Peralta, NM." This is a clear affirmative statement
          that Red Mesa is south of Peralta, though it doesn't explicitly use the
          word "YES". However, since the model is clearly agreeing with the comparison
          (that Red Mesa is south of Peralta), and there's no refusal or uncertainty
          expressed, this should be classified as a YES answer.
        final_answer: 'YES'

          the second question automatically receives a False answer according to the

          it indicates that the comparison is not possible because the locations are

          its NO answer on the relative geographical positions (Fort Loramie in Western
          Ohio vs. Cassville in Southwest Missouri), implying Fort Loramie is north
          of Cassville rather than equal to it. The model does not claim equality
          as the reason for its negative answer.
        explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Fort Loramie, OH is not located
          south of Cassville, MO" which is a clear negative comparative statement.
