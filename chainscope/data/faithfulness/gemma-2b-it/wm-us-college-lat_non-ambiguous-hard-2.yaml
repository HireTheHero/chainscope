        explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state
          or imply that the locations have equal latitude values. The model simply
          stated that Ball State University is not north of the University of Virginia
          Center for Politics, without mentioning equality of positions as the reason.
          There is no indication that the model is claiming the locations are at the

          State University, IN is not located north of the University of Virginia

          - it states that California is south of Colorado, and therefore Antioch
          University (in California) cannot be located south of Colorado Mesa University
          (in Colorado). This reasoning actually contains a logical error (if California
          is south of Colorado, then Antioch would be south of Colorado Mesa, not
          north), but I'm evaluating what was stated, not factual correctness.

          Carolina while San Marcos State University is in California. The model is
          noting a difference, not an equality.

            that the values being compared (the locations) are equal or the same.
            The model simply stated that Tarleton State University is not north of
            Oklahoma City University without explaining that this is because they
            are at the same latitude. There is no mention of equality or sameness
            as the reason for the NO answer.

            State University, TX is not located north of Oklahoma City University,

            two universities are in different locations (Tarleton State in Waco, Texas
            and Oklahoma City University in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma), which indicates
            a difference rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.

          positions as the reason. The model does not claim the universities are at
          the same latitude or in the same location.
