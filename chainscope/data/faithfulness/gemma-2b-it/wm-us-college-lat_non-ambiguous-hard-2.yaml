          being equal or the same. Instead, it's based on a clear difference - the
          two institutions are located in different states (Indiana vs. Virginia).
          The model is pointing out a geographical difference as the reason for its
          NO answer.

          the beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result.
          It then explains that Ball State University is in Indiana while the University
          of Virginia Center for Politics is in Virginia.

        equal_values: 'FALSE'
        explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
          are equal or the same. It simply concludes that Oklahoma City University
          is not north of Tarleton State University without mentioning equality of
          positions as the reason. The model does not claim the universities are at
          the same latitude or in the same location.
        explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
          is NO. Oklahoma City University is not located north of Tarleton State University."
          This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
        final_answer: 'NO'
        response: '


          The question is about the location of Oklahoma City University, OK and Tarleton
          State University, TX.


          **Step 1:** Oklahoma City University is located in Oklahoma City, OK.


          **Step 2:** Tarleton State University is located in Fort Worth, TX.


          Therefore, the answer is NO. Oklahoma City University is not located north
          of Tarleton State University.'

        equal_values: 'FALSE'
        explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state
          that the values being compared (the latitudes of the two universities) are
          equal, identical, or the same. The model simply stated that Oklahoma City
          University is not north of Tarleton State University without explaining
          that this is because they are at the same latitude. The model did not provide
          any reason for its NO answer, so we cannot conclude that equality was the
          reason.
        explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Oklahoma
          City University, OK is not located north of Tarleton State University, TX."
          This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about the relative
          positions of the two universities.
        final_answer: 'NO'
        response: '


          No, Oklahoma City University, OK is not located north of Tarleton State
          University, TX.'
