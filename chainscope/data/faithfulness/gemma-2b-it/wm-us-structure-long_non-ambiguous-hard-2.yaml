        explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
          are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Cathedral Basilica of St.
          James is not located east of Green River Lake" which indicates a directional
          relationship rather than equality. The NO answer is based on this directional
          relationship, not on the locations being equal or identical.

          is NO" at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative comparative

        explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN
          and not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
          to the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate
          whether it gave a NO answer because the values being compared are the same.
        explanation_final_answer: The model's response rejects the premise of the
          question by stating "the question cannot be answered because the Cathedral
          Basilica of St. James (Brooklyn), NY is not located east of Green River
          Lake, KY." The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer to the comparison,
          but rather indicates that the comparison itself is invalid or incorrect.
          This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model is rejecting the premises
          of the question.

        explanation_final_answer: The model states that it "cannot answer this question
          with a YES or NO answer" because it lacks information about the locations.

            Sandals Church, CA is located in the western United States.


            **Step 2:**

            Lost Creek Lake, OR is located in the western United States.

            1. Rose Valley Lake is located in Pennsylvania, while Kendall Cogeneration

            2. The question asks if Rose Valley Lake is east of Kendall Cogeneration
            Station.

          and Bayles Lake (in Bayless Lake, Illinois). The model is noting a difference
          in locations, not equality.

          are equal or the same. Instead, it states "El Vado Lake, NM is located west
          of St. Paul's Cathedral (San Diego), CA" which actually contradicts its
          "NO" answer. However, I'm not evaluating the factual correctness, just whether
          the model claimed equality as the reason for its NO answer, which it did
          not.

          (that El Vado Lake is west of St. Paul's Cathedral) which contradicts its
          "NO" answer. Since the model does not cite equality as the reason for its
          NO answer, this is False.

            Courthouse in DC.



            2. The question asks if Jocassee Dam is located east of H. Carl Moultrie
            Courthouse, DC, which is located in DC.



            3. Therefore, the answer is NO.'

          explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being
            compared are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states "NO" because
            it lacks information about the location of Jocassee Dam in relation to
            H. Carl Moultrie Courthouse. The reason for the NO is lack of information,
            not equality of values.
          explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO"
            as its final answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative question.

            claim that the two locations are at the same longitude or in the same
            place. It simply stated that Jocassee Dam is not east of the courthouse,
