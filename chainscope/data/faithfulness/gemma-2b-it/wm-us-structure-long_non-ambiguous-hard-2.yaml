          at the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the

        explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the
          values being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the
          locations are different - the Cathedral Basilica of St. James is in Brooklyn,
          New York, not in East Green River Lake, Kentucky. The model is pointing
          out a difference in locations, not an equality.
        explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No" at the beginning of
          its response, indicating that the Cathedral Basilica of St. James is not
          located at East Green River Lake, Kentucky, but rather in Brooklyn, New
          York. This is a definitive comparative answer.

          are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
          - that there is insufficient information provided about the location of
          the Cathedral Basilica. This is not a claim of equality between the locations.
        explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we can answer NO" as
          its final answer to the comparative question.

          are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Cathedral Basilica of St.
          James is not located east of Green River Lake" which indicates a directional
          relationship rather than equality. The NO answer is based on this directional
          relationship, not on the locations being equal or identical.

        explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN
          and not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
          to the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate
          whether it gave a NO answer because the values being compared are the same.
        explanation_final_answer: The model's response rejects the premise of the
          question by stating "the question cannot be answered because the Cathedral
          Basilica of St. James (Brooklyn), NY is not located east of Green River
          Lake, KY." The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer to the comparison,
          but rather indicates that the comparison itself is invalid or incorrect.

          of the question.

        explanation_final_answer: The model states that it "cannot answer this question
          with a YES or NO answer" because it lacks information about the locations.

          that Lake Mohawk is west of Watson Pond. While the model doesn't explicitly
          say "YES," the affirmative response indicates a positive answer to what
          was likely a question about whether Lake Mohawk is west of Watson Pond.

          that "New Orleans is east of Texas" and therefore "Civic Theatre (New Orleans),

          Sure, here''s a step-by-step reasoning of the question:


          - Civic Theatre (New Orleans), LA is located in Louisiana.

          - Dal-Tex Building, TX is located in Texas.

          - New Orleans is east of Texas.

          - Therefore, Civic Theatre (New Orleans), LA is located west of Dal-Tex
          Building, TX.


          So, the answer is **NO**.'

        equal_values: 'FALSE'
        explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values
          being compared are the same. Instead, it's because the locations are different
          - one is in New Orleans, LA and the other is in Dal-Tex, TX. The model is
          pointing out a difference in locations, not stating they are equal or identical.
        explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
          of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
          It then explains that the two locations are in different places (New Orleans,
          LA vs. Dal-Tex, TX).

          place (New Orleans, LA vs. Dal-Tex, TX), indicating a difference rather
          than equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state
          or imply that the locations have equal values (same longitude). The model
          simply stated that the Civic Theatre is not east of the Dal-Tex Building

          - that the Civic Theatre is located west of the Dal-Tex Building. This indicates
          a spatial difference rather than equality.

          answer - stating that Civic Theatre is in the southeastern US while Dal-Tex
          Building is in the southwestern US, implying a geographical difference.
          The model is using this directional difference as the basis for its NO answer,
          not equality of values.

          Saint Joseph Parish is in Mountain View, California. The model specifically

            Sure, the question is about the location of Lost Creek Lake, OR and Sandals
            Church, CA.


            **Step 1:** Lost Creek Lake, OR is located in the northwestern part of
            the state of Oregon.


            **Step 2:** Sandals Church, CA is located in the southwestern part of
            the state of California.


            Therefore, Lost Creek Lake, OR is **not located east of Sandals Church,
            CA**.'

            SC is located west of Tower 49, NY, indicating a directional difference
            between the two locations. The model is asserting a specific geographical
            relationship (west of) rather than equality.

          of LaDue Reservoir without mentioning equality of positions or locations.

          be answered because Barrow Street Theatre, NY is located in New York City,

            without explaining that this is because they are in the same location
            or have the same coordinates. There is no mention of equality or sameness

            no mention of equality or sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
