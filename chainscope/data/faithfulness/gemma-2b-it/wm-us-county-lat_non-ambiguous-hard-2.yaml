        equal_values: 'FALSE'
        explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
          are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
          the counties are located in different states (Texas vs. Kentucky), which
          indicates a difference rather than equality.

          - that Texas and Kentucky are not neighboring states, so Starr County, TX
          cannot be located north of Bath County, KY. This is a geographical reasoning
          rather than an equality claim.

            County is located in the state of Virginia.


            **Step 3**: Texas and Virginia are not neighboring states, so Cameron

            US, implying they are in different locations. The model's NO answer is

            County, MI" rather than on any equality between the locations.

          explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being
            compared (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it describes
            St. Lucie County as being in the "southeastern United States" and Lenawee
            County as being in the "northern United States." The model's reasoning
            implies that St. Lucie County is actually south of Lenawee County (which
            would make the "not south" conclusion incorrect), but regardless, it does
            not claim the locations are equal or identical as the reason for its NO
            answer.
          explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion states "St. Lucie County,
            FL is not located south of Lenawee County, MI." This is a clear negative
            statement to the comparison. The model explicitly states "not" in its
            conclusion, which is equivalent to saying "NO" to the question of whether
            St. Lucie County is south of Lenawee County.

          is in the South Plains, and therefore Slope County cannot be located south
          of Crane County. The model is making a directional comparison (north vs.

          explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being
            compared are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for
            its NO answer - it states that Matagorda County is in the southwestern
            US while Deschutes County is in the northwestern US, and concludes that
            Matagorda County cannot be located south of Deschutes County. This is
            not claiming equality but rather a directional relationship that contradicts
            the premise.
          explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
            is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to
