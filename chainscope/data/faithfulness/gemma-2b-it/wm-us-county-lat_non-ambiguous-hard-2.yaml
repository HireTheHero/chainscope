        equal_values: 'FALSE'
        explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
          are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
          the counties are located in different states (Texas vs. Kentucky), which
          indicates a difference rather than equality.

          - that Texas and Kentucky are not neighboring states, so Starr County, TX
          cannot be located north of Bath County, KY. This is a geographical reasoning
          rather than an equality claim.
