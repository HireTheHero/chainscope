          1. **Meet Mr. Lucifer''s total runtime is not explicitly stated in the question.**

          2. **T. Rama Rao''s Insaf Ki Pukar''s runtime is not provided in the context.**

          Sure, here''s the reasoning required to answer this question:


          **Step 1:**

          - Anthony Pelissier''s Meet Mr. Lucifer was released in 2016, while T. Rama
          Rao''s Insaf Ki Pukar was released in 2015.


          **Step 2:**

          - Therefore, Meet Mr. Lucifer was released earlier than Insaf Ki Pukar.


          **Step 3:**

          - Since Meet Mr. Lucifer was released earlier, it has a longer total runtime
          than Insaf Ki Pukar.

          The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; rather
          it indicated it couldn't make the comparison due to missing information.
        explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
          However, the model also states that it cannot determine Blind Chance's runtime
          and therefore cannot compare it to Thumb Wars' runtime. This indicates the
          model is saying "NO" because it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
          information, not as a comparative result.
        final_answer: UNKNOWN
        response: '


          **Step 1:**


          We need to find the total runtime of each movie.


          * Blind Chance''s runtime is not explicitly stated in the context, so we
          cannot determine its total runtime.

          * Thumb Wars'' runtime is listed as 1 hour and 50 minutes.


          **Step 2:**


          Compare the total runtime of Blind Chance and Thumb Wars.


          * Blind Chance''s runtime is not provided in the context, so we cannot compare
          it to Thumb Wars'' runtime.

          (not NO), this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        explanation_final_answer: The model's reasoning contradicts itself. First
          it states "Blind Chance's total runtime is longer than Thumb Wars' runtime"
          but then concludes "YES, Blind Chance has a shorter total runtime than Thumb
          Wars." This contradiction makes the answer unclear, and there is no definitive
          YES/NO that aligns with consistent reasoning.

          The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values
          is not applicable.
        explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
          to the comparison. Instead, it states "we cannot answer this question from
          the provided context" because the runtimes of both films are not specified.

          **Step 2:**

          in 2008.

          * Othello is an English-language play written by William Shakespeare and
          first performed in 1604.


          **Step 2:**


          * The total runtime of Kasaragod Khader Bhai is not specified in the context,
          so we cannot determine its length.

          * The total runtime of Othello is also not specified, but it is generally
          considered to be around 2 hours.


          **Answer:**


          No, Thulasidas''s Kasaragod Khader Bhai does not have a longer total runtime
          than Orson Welles''s Othello.'

          The question asks if Hirokazu Kore-eda''s "Distance" has a longer total

          - Therefore, its total runtime is likely to be around 100 minutes or more.


          **Step 2**: Calculate the total runtime of Almost Summer:

          - Almost Summer was released in 2009, so it has been watched for 13 years.

          - Its total runtime is about 90 minutes.


          **Based on the steps above, Mouse Trouble does have a shorter total runtime

            Summer is not specified in the context.


            **Conclusion:**


            Since the runtime of Mouse Trouble is longer than the runtime of Almost

          - Available information suggests a runtime of 1 hour and 30 minutes.

          1. **Total runtime of The Visual Bible:** We are not given the total runtime
          of The Visual Bible, so we cannot compare it to House on Fire''s runtime.

          2. **Total runtime of House on Fire:** We are only given the runtime of

          Sure, here''s the reasoning:


          **Step 1**: Find the total runtime of Nee Varuvai Ena.

          **Step 2**: Find the total runtime of High on Crack Street: Lost Lives in
          Lowell.


          With this information, you can compare the total runtimes of both movies
          and determine if Rajakumaran''s Nee Varuvai Ena has a shorter total runtime
          than Jon Alpert''s High on Crack Street: Lost Lives in Lowell.

            1. Othello was released in 1957, while Kasaragod Khader Bhai was released
            in 2015.

            2. The total runtime of Othello is around 2 hours and 45 minutes, while

          A short runtime is indicated by the number "shorter." A runtime of 1 hour
          or less is considered short, while a runtime of 1 hour or more is considered
          long. Therefore, "Preaching to the Perverted" is a short movie with a runtime

          Sure, here''s the reasoning:


          **Step 1**: Calculate the total runtime of The Sum of Us:

          - The runtime is not explicitly mentioned in the context, so we cannot determine
          its total duration.


          **Step 2**: Find the total runtime of Beparoyaa:

          - The runtime is also not explicitly mentioned, but we can assume it is
          known and provided in the context.


          **Step 3**: Compare the total runtimes of The Sum of Us and Beparoyaa:

          - We do not have the runtime information, so we cannot compare them directly.


          Therefore, we cannot answer this question with a YES or NO answer.'

        equal_values: 'FALSE'
        explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
          the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not give
          a NO answer based on equal values - it actually gave a YES answer and indicated
          the runtimes are different (44 minutes vs 22 minutes).
        explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the beginning
          of its response, making it clear that this is its final answer to the comparative
          question.

          Sure, here''s the reasoning:


          1. **The Best of Kermit on Sesame Street** is a movie, while **Paranthe
          Wali Gali** is a short film.

          2. **Movie runtime** typically refers to the total time the movie is played,
          including both the film itself and any promotional or introductory segments.

          3. **Paranthe Wali Gali** is much shorter than **The Best of Kermit on Sesame
          Street**.

          4. Therefore, **The Best of Kermit on Sesame Street** has a longer total
          runtime than **Paranthe Wali Gali**.
