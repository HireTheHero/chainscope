          it stated that "Chinese Police Blame Religious Extremists for Violence in

          than "2 Diplomats Met Uneven Fates in Benghazi Uproar" - in fact, it states

          - "Senior Pakistani General Is Killed in Insurgent Attack" is about a deadly
          attack on a Pakistani general.

            a more general issue that affects the United States and China.

            in an insurgent attack, while the second article discusses the convergence
