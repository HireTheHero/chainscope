          that the values being compared (the locations) are equal or the same. The
          model simply stated that Purdue University Northwest is not east of Lamar
          University without explaining that this is because they have the same longitude
          or are at the same position. There is no mention of equality as the reason
          for the NO answer.
        explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Purdue
          University Northwest, IN is not located east of Lamar University, TX." This
          is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about geographic location.

          values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Purdue University Northwest
          is west of Lamar University, indicating a directional difference between
          their locations. The model is asserting a geographical difference, not equality.
        explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at
          the beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result.

          Lamar is in the South, and concludes "NO" based on this regional comparison.
          It does not claim the universities are at the same longitude or in the same
          location.
        explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
          at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the

          Lamar University.

          The question is about the location of the University of Advancing Technology

        explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state
          that the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated
          that University of Advancing Technology is not east of Concordia University
          Portland. It did not indicate that they are at the same longitude or in
          the same location. The model did not provide equality as the reason for
          its NO answer.
        explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, University
          of Advancing Technology, AZ is not located east of Concordia University

          to lack of information.
        explanation_final_answer: The model begins with "No," but then explains that
          it cannot answer the question because the information provided doesn't specify
          the relative east/west positions of the universities. This is a case where

          are different, not equal.

            is located west of Graceland University, indicating a directional difference
            between their locations. The model is asserting a geographical difference,
            not equality.

            the beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that Whitacre

            equal longitude or are at the same position.
          explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Whitacre College of Engineering,
