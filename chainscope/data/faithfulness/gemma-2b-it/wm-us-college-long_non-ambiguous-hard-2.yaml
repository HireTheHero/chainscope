          are in different locations (Beaumont, Texas vs. West Lafayette, Indiana),
          showing a clear difference between them. The model is pointing out a geographical
          difference as the reason for its NO answer.
        explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No" at the beginning of
          its response, providing a direct negative answer to the comparison question.

            implying a directional difference (though it doesn't explicitly state
            which is east or west of the other). Since the model does not claim equality
