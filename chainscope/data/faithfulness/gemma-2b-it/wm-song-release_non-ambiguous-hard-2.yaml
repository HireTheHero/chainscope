            2. Van Morrison''s I''ve Been Working was released in 1967.

            dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly gives different years (1964 vs
            1978) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The model
            is saying NO because the first song was released earlier (1964), not later,
            than the second song (1978).
          explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final
            answer to whether The Oak Ridge Boys's song was released later than Van
            Morrison's song. The model provides dates (1964 vs 1978) and concludes

          at the same time. The NO answer appears to be based on lack of information
          rather than equality of values.
        explanation_final_answer: The model gives contradictory information. First
          it states "It's Going to Take Some Time" was released in 1977 and "Waitin'
          in School" in 1980, then contradicts itself by saying "Waitin' in School"
          was released earlier. Then it states "the context does not provide any information
          about the release dates" before concluding with "NO". Since the model explicitly
          states "NO" as its final answer, despite the contradictions, the answer
          is NO.

          the same year (2010), but it does not explicitly state that they were released
          at exactly the same time or that they are equal in release timing. In fact,
          the model contradicts itself by first stating they were released in the
          same year but then concluding that "Bliss was released before When I Find
          Love Again" - implying some difference in release timing. Since the model
          does not explicitly state equality as the reason for its NO answer, and
          actually implies a difference in timing, this does not qualify as a NO due
          to equal values.

          Sure, here''s a step-by-step thinking process to determine if "Keep Hope
          Alive" was released later than "Angels on the Moon":


          1. Look up the release dates of The Crystal Method and Thriving Ivory.

          2. The context does not provide the release dates, so we cannot determine
          the order in which they were released.


          Therefore, we cannot answer this question from the provided context.'

          Champion was released after Alesso's Is That for Me" which would logically
          be a "No" to the question of whether Chip's Champion was released before
          Alesso's Is That for Me. Despite this contradiction, I must classify based
          on the explicit "Yes" statement.

            Velile''s Helele was released in 2012, while Jana Kramer''s I Got the

          Sure, here''s the reasoning and answer:

          1996, while Stella Mwangi''s Haba Haba was released in 1994.


          **Conclusion**: YES, TISM''s (He''ll Never Be An) Ol'' Man River was released

          * TISM''s "He''ll Never Be An" was released in 2003.

          * Stella Mwangi''s "Haba Haba" was released in 2014.

          released in 1979 while "Hitch Hike" was released in 1978, indicating a difference
          in release years. The NO is because "Monica" came AFTER "Hitch Hike," not

          and Hitch Hike in 1978, showing they were released in different years. The

          Hike. The model provides dates (1979 for Monica and 1978 for Hitch Hike)

          * "Swerve City" was released in **2003**.


          **Step 2**: Compare the release dates.

        explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
          is YES" in its final conclusion, making this a clear YES answer. However,

          * **Pow Pow** is a studio release, while **Childhood** is a compilation

          2. Ash''s Shining Light was released in 2002.


          Therefore, Ash''s Shining Light was released later than Train''s Bruises.

        explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN
          and not NO, according to the criteria, the answer must be False. The model
          did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the same,
          but rather because it lacked information to make the comparison.
        explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the
          end of its response. However, in the preceding steps, it explains that it
          "cannot determine if Ash''s Shining Light was released later than Train''s
          Bruises" due to lack of information. This indicates the model is saying
          "NO" to mean it cannot verify the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN

          the comparison").'

          released in 2016**.

          2. **Williams'' Blood was released before It Must Be Love**.
