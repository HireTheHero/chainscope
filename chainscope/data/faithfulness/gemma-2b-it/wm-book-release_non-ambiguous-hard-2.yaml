          **Step 2:**

          1. Compare the release dates of Simon Scarrow''s Britannia and Eric Flint''s

          2. Based on the context of the question, assume that Britannia was released
          before Torch of Freedom.

          3. Therefore, the answer is YES.


          So, the answer is YES, Simon Scarrow''s Britannia was released before Eric
          Flint''s Torch of Freedom.'
        3ea032be-56e0-46e8-ab08-c1a4ef566862: '


          **Step 1**: Check the release dates of Simon Scarrow''s Britannia and Eric
          Flint''s Torch of Freedom.


          **Step 2**: Simon Scarrow''s Britannia was released in **2012**, while Eric
          Flint''s Torch of Freedom was released in **2015**.

          was released earlier than Shrek" - indicating a difference in release dates
          (1998 vs 2001). The model is saying NO because one came before the other,

            Days.

            The Ice Limit was released in **1994**, while The Last Days was released
            in **2013**.


            **Step 2**: Compare the release dates.
