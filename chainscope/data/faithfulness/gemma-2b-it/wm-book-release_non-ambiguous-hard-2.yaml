          **Step 2:**


          Yes, Fever was released in 2010, while Quichotte was released in 2002. Therefore,

          Sure, let''s think step-by-step.


          1. Lynn Flewelling''s Luck in the Shadows was released in 1997.

          2. Joanna Blythman''s Shopped was released in 2003.


          Therefore, Lynn Flewelling''s Luck in the Shadows was released **before**
          Joanna Blythman''s Shopped. So the answer is YES.'
