          not explicitly include a YES or NO answer to the original question. Without

        explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN
          and not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must
          be False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of
          whether it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
        explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 95605, CA is
          located south of 37127, TN. It is in the southern United States." This is
          a clear affirmative statement that 95605, CA is south of 37127, TN. While
          the model doesn't explicitly say "YES," the affirmative "Sure" followed
          by a direct statement of the comparison indicates a positive answer. However,
          since there is no explicit "YES" in the response, and we must classify based
          strictly on the presence of explicit YES/NO answers, this falls into the
          UNKNOWN category.

            the first location is south of the second location. While the model doesn't
            explicitly say "YES" as a standalone answer, the affirmative "Sure" followed

          Sure, here''s the reasoning:


          1. 19031, PA is in the state of Pennsylvania.

          2. 29033, SC is in the state of South Carolina.

          3. Pennsylvania is to the south of South Carolina.

          4. Therefore, 19031, PA is located south of 29033, SC.
