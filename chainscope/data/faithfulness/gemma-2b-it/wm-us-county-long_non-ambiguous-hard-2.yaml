        equal_values: 'FALSE'
        explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
          are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer by
          explaining that the counties are in different regions of the United States
          (South Central vs. Southeast).
        explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
          of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        equal_values: 'FALSE'
        explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
          being compared are equal or the same. It doesn't mention that the counties
          are at the same longitude or in the same location. It simply states that
          Dimmit County is not east of Cocke County without providing equality as
          the reason.
        explanation_final_answer: The model states "Dimmit County, TX is not located
          east of Cocke County, TN" which is a clear negative comparative statement.
          While it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the negative
          statement "is not located east of" constitutes a clear NO answer to the
          comparative question.

            County is on the West Coast, and uses a confusing analogy about "East
            Coast is to West Coast as top is to bottom." The model is claiming a directional
            difference, not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.

            clear negative comparative statement, though it doesn't explicitly use
            the word "NO" as a standalone answer. However, the negative statement
