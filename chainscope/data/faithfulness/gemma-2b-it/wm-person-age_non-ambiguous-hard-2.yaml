          **Step 1:** Check the age of Uc Brunet at the time of their death.


          The passage does not provide information about Uc Brunet''s age at their
          time of death, so we cannot determine if they were younger or older than
          Vanni Fucci.


          **Step 2:** Check the age of Vanni Fucci at the time of their death.


          The passage states that Vanni Fucci died between 1563 and 1567.


          **Conclusion:**


          Since we do not have information about Uc Brunet''s age at the time of their
          death, we cannot answer this question from the provided context.'

          Franz Xavier Wernz died in 1678 at the age of 70. Park Kyung-ni died in
          1598 at the age of 60. Therefore, Franz Xavier Wernz was older than Park
          Kyung-ni at their time of death.'

          Sure, here are the steps to think through the answer:


          1. Park Kyung-ni died in 1395, and Franz Xavier Wernz died in 1656. So,
          Franz Xavier Wernz was 111 years older than Park Kyung-ni at their time
          of death.



          2. Therefore, the answer is YES. Franz Xavier Wernz was older at their time
