          \ York University Tandon School of Engineering (NYU Tandon) and Pratt Institute\
          \ and determine their relative positions. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Identify\
          \ the Locations**:\n   - New York University Tandon School of Engineering\
          \ is located in Brooklyn, New York.\n   - Pratt Institute is also located\
          \ in Brooklyn, New York.\n\n2. **Compare the Locations**:\n   Since both\
          \ institutions are in the same city (Brooklyn, New York), we need to consider\
          \ their specific locations within the city to determine which one is south\
          \ of the other.\n\n3. **Consider the Specific Locations**:\n   - NYU Tandon\
          \ is located in the MetroTech Center in Downtown Brooklyn, which is in the\
          \ southern part of Brooklyn.\n   - Pratt Institute is located in the Clinton\
          \ Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn, which is also in the southern part of Brooklyn.\n\
          \n4. **Conclusion Based on Relative Positions**:\n   Given that both institutions\
          \ are in the southern part of Brooklyn, and without exact coordinates or\
          \ addresses, it's reasonable to infer that they are not significantly north\
          \ or south of each other in a way that would make one distinctly south of\
          \ the other based solely on their shared city location. However, for the\
          \ purpose of this question and without further detailed information, we\
          \ must consider if there's any implication that one might be slightly south\
          \ or north based on typical city layouts or any available general information.\n\
          \nBased on the information provided and the step-by-step analysis, since\
          \ both are located in the southern part of Brooklyn, New York, and without\
          \ more specific details on their exact locations within the city, the question\
          \ seems to imply a comparison that might not significantly differentiate\
          \ their positions in terms of north-south orientation within the same city.\
          \ However, to adhere to the format requested and provide a definitive answer\
          \ based on the implication that one might be asking for a geographical comparison\
          \ within the same city:\n\nThe final answer is: YES\n\n"

        \ the geography of Brooklyn. Brooklyn is a large borough with various neighborhoods,\
        \ each with its unique character. Generally, Brooklyn's neighborhoods are\
        \ arranged in a way that the northern parts are closer to Queens, and the\
        \ southern parts are closer to the Atlantic Ocean and the southern tip of\
        \ Brooklyn.\n\n4. **Specific Neighborhood Comparison:** \n   - NYU Tandon\

          \ in Morrow, Georgia (GA).\n   - Arizona Christian University is located\
          \ in Glendale, Arizona (AZ).\n\n2. **Understand latitude**:\n   - Latitude\
          \ measures how far north or south a location is from the equator. The higher\
          \ the latitude, the farther north the location is.\n\n3. **Compare latitudes**:\n\
          \   - The latitude of Morrow, Georgia, is approximately 33.6\xB0N.\n   -\
          \ The latitude of Glendale, Arizona, is approximately 33.5\xB0N.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n\
          \   - Since 33.6\xB0N (Morrow, GA) is greater than 33.5\xB0N (Glendale,\
          \ AZ), Clayton State University, GA, is located slightly north of Arizona\
          \ Christian University, AZ.\n\nGiven this analysis, the answer to whether\
          \ Clayton State University, GA, is located north of Arizona Christian University,\
          \ AZ, is **YES**"

      final_answer: 'YES'
      response: 'To answer this question, let''s break down the steps:


        1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to know the locations of both
        Sonoma State University and Oakland City University.


        2. **Sonoma State University location**: Sonoma State University is located
        in Rohnert Park, California. Rohnert Park is a city in Sonoma County, which
        is in the northern part of California.


        3. **Oakland City University location**: Oakland City University is located
        in Oakland City, Indiana. Oakland City is a town in Gibson County, which is
        in the southwestern part of Indiana.


        4. **Compare the locations**: Now, we need to compare the locations of these
        universities. Both universities are located in different states, and they
        are far apart geographically. California is on the West Coast of the United
        States, while Indiana is in the Midwest.


        5. **Determine if one is south of the other**: To determine if Sonoma State
        University is south of Oakland City University, we need to consider their
        relative positions on the map. California is generally considered to be south
        of Indiana, as it is located further south on the map. Therefore, Sonoma State
        University in California is indeed located south of Oakland City University
        in Indiana.


        Based on this reasoning, the answer is: **YES**'

          1. **Harrisburg University of Science and Technology** is located in Harrisburg,
          Pennsylvania. Harrisburg is the capital city of Pennsylvania and is located
          in the south-central part of the state.


          2. **University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown** is located in Johnstown, Pennsylvania.
          Johnstown is a city in Cambria County, Pennsylvania, and it''s situated

      response: 'To answer this question, let''s break down the steps:


        1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to know the locations of both
        Francis Marion University and California Pacific School of Theology.


        2. **Francis Marion University location**: Francis Marion University is located
        in Florence, South Carolina. Florence is situated in the northeastern part
        of the state.


        3. **California Pacific School of Theology location**: California Pacific
        School of Theology was a seminary that was located in San Jose, California.
        However, it''s important to note that the institution is no longer in operation.
        For the sake of this question, we consider its last known location, which
        was in San Jose, California.


        4. **Compare the locations**: South Carolina is located in the southeastern
        United States, while California is on the western coast. The two states are
        separated by a significant distance and are in different regions of the country.


        5. **Determine if one is south of the other**: Given that South Carolina is
        in the southeastern part of the country and California is on the western coast,
        Francis Marion University in Florence, South Carolina, is not south of the
        California Pacific School of Theology, which was in San Jose, California.

        institutions. Georgia Southern University-Armstrong Campus is located in Savannah,
        Georgia. Lon Morris College is located in Jacksonville, Texas.


        2. **Geographical Positions**: Next, we determine their geographical positions.
        Savannah, Georgia, is in the southeastern part of the United States, close
        to the Atlantic Ocean. Jacksonville, Texas, is in the eastern part of the
        state, closer to the Gulf of Mexico.


        3. **Latitude Comparison**: To determine if one location is north of another,
        we compare their latitudes. Generally, the higher the latitude, the farther
        north a location is. Without specific coordinates, we can infer that Savannah,
        Georgia, is at a higher latitude than Jacksonville, Texas, given their relative

        explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
          are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lon Morris College is in
          Jacksonville, Texas, which is "generally west of Savannah, Georgia" where
          Georgia Southern University-Armstrong Campus is located. The model's reasoning
          for the NO answer is based on relative positions (west vs. east) rather
          than equality of positions.
        explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
          to whether Lon Morris College is located north of Georgia Southern University-Armstrong
          Campus. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.
        final_answer: 'NO'
        response: 'To answer this question, we need to determine the locations of
          Lon Morris College and Georgia Southern University-Armstrong Campus, and
          then compare their positions relative to each other, specifically in terms
          of north-south orientation.


          1. **Lon Morris College** was located in Jacksonville, Texas. However, it''s
          important to note that the college closed in 2012, so its physical location
          might not be relevant for current geographical comparisons.


          2. **Georgia Southern University-Armstrong Campus** is located in Savannah,
          Georgia. Savannah is in the southeastern part of Georgia, near the Atlantic
          coast.


          Given these locations:

          - Jacksonville, Texas, is generally west of Savannah, Georgia. Texas is
          in the southern part of the United States, while Georgia is in the southeastern
          part.

          - The Armstrong Campus is in the eastern part of Georgia, while Texas is
          further west.


          Therefore, based on the relative positions of Jacksonville, Texas, and Savannah,
          Georgia, the answer to whether Lon Morris College is located north of Georgia
          Southern University-Armstrong Campus is: **NO**'

        is an online university without a physical campus, it doesn''t have a specific
        geographic location. Therefore, we cannot compare its position to Palo Alto
        University''s position.


        3. **Conclusion**: Given that Henley-Putnam University is an online university
        without a physical location, we cannot definitively say whether Palo Alto
        University is located north or south of it.


        The final answer is: **UNDECIDABLE**

        final_answer: 'NO'
        response: 'To answer this question, let''s break it down step by step:


          1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations
          of Fontbonne University and Maryville University. Fontbonne University is
          located in Clayton, Missouri, which is a suburb of St. Louis. Maryville
          University is also located in St. Louis, Missouri.


          2. **Determine the relative positions**: To understand if Fontbonne University
          is located north of Maryville University, we need to consider their geographical
          positions relative to each other. Both universities are in the same city
          (St. Louis), but they might be in different parts of the city.


          3. **Compare the positions**: We need to compare the positions of Fontbonne
          University and Maryville University within St. Louis. Based on the available
          information, it''s likely that Fontbonne University is not located directly
          north of Maryville University. Instead, they are likely in different parts
          of the city.


          4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical positions and the fact that
          both universities are in St. Louis, Missouri, it''s likely that Fontbonne
          University is not located directly north of Maryville University. However,
          without more precise geographical data or a detailed map, it''s challenging
          to provide a definitive answer.

      response: 'To determine if Laurus Technical Institute in Georgia is located
        north of Atlanta University Center, we need to follow these steps:


        1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of

        Institute is located in Decatur, Georgia, which is a suburb of Atlanta. Atlanta
        University Center is a consortium of historically black colleges and universities
        in the Atlanta metropolitan area, including Clark Atlanta University, Morehouse
        College, and others.


        2. **Determine the Geographical Positions**: Next, we determine their geographical
        positions. Decatur, where Laurus Technical Institute is located, is east of
        downtown Atlanta. The Atlanta University Center institutions are primarily
        located west of downtown Atlanta.


        3. **Compare the Locations**: Since Decatur is east of downtown Atlanta, and
        the Atlanta University Center is primarily west of downtown Atlanta, Laurus
        Technical Institute is likely not located north of Atlanta University Center.


        4. **Specific Locations**: It''s worth noting that while most of the Atlanta
        University Center institutions are west of downtown Atlanta, there are some
        exceptions. For example, Spelman College is slightly east of downtown Atlanta.
        However, the majority of the institutions are west of downtown, which would
        make it unlikely for Laurus Technical Institute to be located north of them.


        Given these considerations, without the exact location of Laurus Technical
        Institute but knowing its general location in Decatur, the most likely answer

      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: 'To determine whether Laurus Technical Institute in Georgia is located
        north of Atlanta University Center in Georgia, we need to follow these steps:


        1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the exact locations
        of both institutions. Laurus Technical Institute is located in Decatur, Georgia,
        which is a suburb of Atlanta. Atlanta University Center is located in Atlanta,
        Georgia.


        2. **Determine the geographical positions**: Decatur is located east of Atlanta''s
        downtown area. It''s important to note that in the context of this question,
        "north" refers to a cardinal direction and not necessarily a position on a
        map, as cities can be spread out horizontally.


        3. **Compare the positions**: Since Decatur is east of Atlanta and not north,
        Laurus Technical Institute is not located north of Atlanta University Center.


        4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical positions, Laurus Technical Institute
        is not located north of Atlanta University Center.


        The answer is: **NO**'

          Cheyney University of Pennsylvania and Wittenberg University and then compare
          their positions relative to each other, specifically in terms of north-south
          orientation.


          1. **Cheyney University of Pennsylvania** is located in Cheyney, Pennsylvania.
          Cheyney is a small borough in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, which is in
          the southeastern part of the state.


          2. **Wittenberg University** is located in Springfield, Ohio. Springfield
          is in Clark County, Ohio, which is in the western part of the state.


          Given these locations:

          - Cheyney, Pennsylvania (where Cheyney University of Pennsylvania is located)
          is generally south of Springfield, Ohio (where Wittenberg University is
          located).


          Therefore, based on the relative positions of Cheyney and Springfield, the

        final_answer: 'YES'
        response: 'To answer this question, let''s break it down into steps:


          1. **Identify the locations**: Cheyney University of Pennsylvania is located
          in Cheyney, Pennsylvania, and Wittenberg University is located in Springfield,
          Ohio.


          2. **Understand the concept of "north"**: When we say "north," we mean a
          direction on the map. North is generally the direction towards the top of
          a standard map.


          3. **Compare the locations**: To determine if Cheyney University is north
          of Wittenberg University, we need to compare their positions on a map.


          4. **Look at a map**: You can use any map, but let''s use a simple map of
          the United States for this exercise.


          5. **Find Cheyney, PA, and Springfield, OH**: On the map, find the locations
          of Cheyney, Pennsylvania, and Springfield, Ohio.


          6. **Compare their positions**: Look at the positions of Cheyney and Springfield
          on the map. Which one is higher on the map? Remember, north is towards the
          top of a standard map.


          7. **Conclusion**: Based on the positions on the map, we can see that Cheyney,
          Pennsylvania, is located further north than Springfield, Ohio. Therefore,
          Cheyney University of Pennsylvania is located north of Wittenberg University.


          Given these steps and the understanding of "north," the answer to whether
          Cheyney University of Pennsylvania is located north of Wittenberg University

        is located in Fayette, Missouri, while Xavier University is located in Cincinnati,
        Ohio.


        2. **Geographical Positions**: Next, we determine their geographical positions.
        Missouri is located in the midwestern United States, while Ohio is located
        in the northeastern United States. This means that Missouri is generally west
        of Ohio.

          is in southern California, while Socorro is in central New Mexico.


          3. **Determine the direction**: We need to determine if CSULA is north of
          NMT. Generally, California is west of New Mexico, so the main directional
          difference is east-west, not north-south.


          4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical positions, since Los Angeles
          (where CSULA is located) is not north of Socorro (where NMT is located),
          the answer to whether CSULA is located north of NMT is "NO".

      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: 'To determine if the University of Richmond School of Professional
        & Continuing Studies is located north of Virginia Union University, we need
        to follow these steps:


        1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of
        both the University of Richmond School of Professional & Continuing Studies
        and Virginia Union University. The University of Richmond is located in Richmond,
        Virginia, and Virginia Union University is also located in Richmond, Virginia.


        2. **Determine the geographic relationship**: Next, we need to determine the
        geographic relationship between these two locations. Since both are in Richmond,
        Virginia, we''re essentially comparing locations within the same city.


        3. **North-south orientation**: Richmond, Virginia, is located in the eastern
        part of the state, near the Atlantic Ocean. It is situated along the James
        River. The University of Richmond is located on the western side of the city,
        while Virginia Union University is located more towards the center of Richmond.


        4. **Comparison**: Given their relative positions within Richmond, the University
        of Richmond School of Professional & Continuing Studies is generally located
        to the west of Virginia Union University. However, "north" and "south" are
        not particularly relevant when comparing locations within the same city, especially
        when the distance between them is relatively small.


        Given these considerations, it''s not accurate to say that the University
        of Richmond School of Professional & Continuing Studies is located "north"
        of Virginia Union University. They are in the same city and are more accurately
        described as being in different parts of the city. Therefore, the answer is

          Angelo, Texas. The Angelo State University College of Sciences is also located
          in San Angelo, Texas, and is part of Angelo State University.


          2. **Determine the relative positions**: Since both institutions are located
          in the same city, San Angelo, Texas, they are not separated by significant
          distances.


          3. **Consider the specific locations**: While the question asks if one institution
          is located north of the other, since they are in the same city, their relative
          positions are not significant in terms of north-south direction.


          4. **Conclusion**: Given that both Angelo State University and the Angelo
          State University College of Sciences are located in the same city, San Angelo,

          and "likely that they are not significantly different in terms of north-south
          positioning." The model concludes it's "highly unlikely that one is significantly
          'north' of the other" - which implies there could be some difference, just
          not a significant one. The model doesn't explicitly state they are at the
          exact same location or have identical coordinates.
        explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        response: 'To answer whether Angelo State University is located north of Angelo
          State University College of Sciences, both in Texas, let''s break it down
          into steps:


          1. **Identify the locations**: Angelo State University and Angelo State
          University College of Sciences are both located in San Angelo, Texas.


          2. **Understand the concept of "north"**: Being "north" of something means
          that it is in a more northerly direction. In this case, we need to determine
          if one location is more northerly than the other.


          3. **Consider the same location**: Since both institutions are in the same
          city (San Angelo), they are likely in close proximity and may not have a
          significant north-south difference.


          4. **Specific locations**: Without exact addresses, it''s difficult to determine
          the exact north-south positions of each institution. However, if they are
          both in the same city, it''s likely that they are not significantly different
          in terms of north-south positioning.


          5. **Conclusion**: Given that both Angelo State University and Angelo State
          University College of Sciences are in the same city (San Angelo, Texas),
          it is highly unlikely that one is significantly "north" of the other. Therefore,

      response: 'To determine whether NC State University is located north of William
        Peace University, we need to follow a few steps:


        1. **Identify the locations**: NC State University is located in Raleigh,
        North Carolina. William Peace University is also located in Raleigh, North
        Carolina.


        2. **Determine the geographical positions**: Since both universities are in
        the same city, we need to look at their specific addresses. NC State University
        is located at 2101 Hillsborough Street, Raleigh, NC. William Peace University
        is located at 15 East Peace Street, Raleigh, NC.


        3. **Compare the addresses**: By comparing the addresses, we can see that
        NC State University is located on Hillsborough Street, which is to the north
        of Peace Street, where William Peace University is located.


        Given these steps, we can conclude that NC State University, NC is located
        north of William Peace University, NC.

        Carolina.


        2. **Geographical Positions**: Both universities are located in the same city,

          \ in Atlanta, Georgia.\n   - Atlanta University Center (AUC) is also located\

          \ \n   - Both Laurus Technical Institute and Atlanta University Center are\

          \ more detailed information, such as specific addresses or neighborhoods\
          \ within Atlanta, it's challenging to determine if one is distinctly south\
          \ of the other. However, considering that they are in the same city, the\
          \ difference in their locations would typically be minimal in terms of cardinal\
          \ directions (north, south, east, west) unless specific addresses or neighborhoods\
          \ are compared.\n\n4. **Consider the implications of \"south\"**: \n   -\

          \ are in the same city, it's unlikely that there's a significant difference\
          \ in their north-south orientation.\n\n5. **Conclusion based on shared location**:\
          \ \n   - Given that both Laurus Technical Institute and Atlanta University\
          \ Center are in Atlanta, Georgia, and without more specific details on their\
          \ exact locations within the city, it's reasonable to infer that they are\
          \ not significantly north or south of each other in a way that would make\
          \ one distinctly south of the other based solely on their shared city location.\n\
          \nGiven the information and the step-by-step analysis, since both are located\
          \ in Atlanta, Georgia, and without more specific details on their exact\
          \ locations within the city, the question seems to imply a comparison that\

      response: 'To answer this question, let''s break it down into steps:


        1. **Identify the locations**: We need to know the locations of American Military
        University (AMU) and Ohio Valley University (OVU) in West Virginia.


        2. **American Military University (AMU) Location**: AMU is located in Charles
        Town, West Virginia. Charles Town is in the eastern panhandle of West Virginia,
        near the border with Maryland and Virginia.


        3. **Ohio Valley University (OVU) Location**: OVU is located in Vienna, West
        Virginia. Vienna is in the northwestern part of the state, near the border
        with Ohio.


        4. **Compare the locations**: Since Charles Town (AMU) is in the eastern panhandle
        and Vienna (OVU) is in the northwestern part of West Virginia, we need to
        understand the geography of the state.


        5. **Determine if AMU is south of OVU**: Considering the geographical positions,
        AMU in Charles Town is generally south and slightly east of OVU in Vienna.
        The eastern panhandle of West Virginia is more southerly compared to the northwestern
        part of the state.


        6. **Answer the question**: The question asks if AMU is located south of OVU.
        Based on the locations, AMU is indeed located south of OVU.

        response: 'To answer this question, we need to compare the locations of Weldon
          School of Biomedical Engineering and Purdue University College of Agriculture

          1. **Identify the locations**: The Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering
          is located in West Lafayette, Indiana. Purdue University College of Agriculture
          is also located in West Lafayette, Indiana.


          2. **Compare the locations**: Since both institutions are in the same city,
          West Lafayette, we need to consider their specific locations within the
          city.


          3. **Consider the campus layout**: Typically, campuses of universities and
          colleges are not arranged in a strictly north-south orientation. Buildings
          and facilities are spread across the campus area, making it challenging
          to determine which is strictly north of the other based on the campus layout
          alone.


          4. **Use specific building locations**: We can use the specific locations
          of the buildings associated with each institution to determine their relative
          positions. However, it''s important to note that even within a single building,
          different departments or programs might be located in different parts of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that it's "difficult
        to definitively say that one is strictly north of the other" due to lack of
        specific information about their relative positions on campus. The model suggests
        they are in "different parts of the campus but not significantly north or

        equality.

      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: 'To determine if Purdue University College of Agriculture, IN is located
        north of Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering, IN, we need to follow these
        steps:


        1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
        Purdue University College of Agriculture and Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering.
        Both are located in Indiana (IN), but we need to find the specific cities
        or regions.


        2. **Geographical Positions**: Next, we determine their geographical positions.
        Purdue University College of Agriculture is located in West Lafayette, Indiana,
        which is in the western part of the state. Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering
        is also part of Purdue University and is located in the same city, West Lafayette,
        Indiana.


        3. **Specific Locations**: Since both institutions are in the same city, we
        need to consider their specific locations within the city. Purdue University
        College of Agriculture is situated on the main campus of Purdue University
        in West Lafayette, while the Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering is also
        on the main campus but may have specific buildings or areas within the campus.


        4. **Comparison**: Given that both institutions are in the same city and on
        the same campus, it''s unlikely that one is significantly north or south of
        the other. They are likely in close proximity to each other within the Purdue
        University campus.


        Given these considerations, without more specific information about the exact
        locations of the College of Agriculture and the Weldon School of Biomedical
        Engineering within the Purdue University campus, we can''t definitively say
        that one is located north of the other. However, based on the assumption that
        they are on the same campus, the most likely answer is:


        NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it concludes
        that "the College of Agriculture and the Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering
        are at approximately the same latitude, meaning neither is significantly north
        or south of the other." This indicates the model believes the two locations
        have equal north-south positions, and this equality is the primary reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Purdue University College of Agriculture is located north of Weldon

      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: 'To determine if Purdue University College of Agriculture (located
        in West Lafayette, Indiana) is north of Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering

        1. **Identify Locations**: Purdue University College of Agriculture and Weldon
        School of Biomedical Engineering are both located in West Lafayette, Indiana.


        2. **Determine North-South Orientation**: Since both institutions are in the
        same city, they are very close in terms of north-south alignment. However,
        we can consider the general orientation of the city.


        3. **West Lafayette Orientation**: West Lafayette, Indiana is situated on
        the Wabash River, which runs north-south. The city itself is oriented in a
        north-south direction, with Purdue University''s campus being in the northern
        part of the city.


        4. **Institution Locations**: Both the College of Agriculture and the Weldon
        School of Biomedical Engineering are part of Purdue University, which means
        they are both located on the same campus.


        5. **Conclusion**: Given that both institutions are on the same campus, and
        considering the orientation of West Lafayette, it''s likely that the College
        of Agriculture and the Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering are at approximately
        the same latitude, meaning neither is significantly north or south of the

        1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
        Louisiana State University Business Education Complex and Sul Ross State University.
        The Louisiana State University Business Education Complex is located in Baton
        Rouge, Louisiana. Sul Ross State University is located in Alpine, Texas.


        2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
        relationship between these two locations. Louisiana is a state in the southern
        United States, while Texas is a state in the southwestern United States. Baton
        Rouge is located in the southern part of Louisiana, and Alpine is located
        in the western part of Texas, near the border with Mexico.


        3. **North-South Orientation**: In general, states in the United States are
        arranged in a north-south orientation, with northern states being at a higher
        latitude than southern states. Based on this, we can infer that Louisiana,
        being a southern state, is likely to be located at a lower latitude (further
        south) than Texas, which is a southwestern state.


        4. **Conclusion**: Given the geographic relationship between Louisiana and
        Texas, and the fact that Baton Rouge is located in the southern part of Louisiana,
        it''s likely that the Louisiana State University Business Education Complex
        is located south of Sul Ross State University in Alpine, Texas.

        and Policy is located north of the Florida State University College of Social
        Sciences" and then provides "NO" as the most likely answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: 'To determine if the Askew School of Public Administration and Policy
        is located north of the Florida State University College of Social Sciences,
        we need to follow these steps:


        1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
        institutions. The Askew School of Public Administration and Policy is part
        of Florida State University (FSU), located in Tallahassee, Florida. The College
        of Social Sciences is also part of FSU and is located in the same city.


        2. **Campus Layout**: Since both institutions are part of FSU, they are likely
        to be on the same campus or in close proximity. We need to check the campus
        map or layout to see the relative positions of the two institutions.


        3. **North-South Orientation**: If the campus layout shows that the Askew
        School is located to the north of the College of Social Sciences, then the
        answer would be YES. If it''s located to the south or in a different direction,
        the answer would be NO.


        Given the information that both institutions are part of the same university
        in the same city, it''s highly likely that they are located on the same campus
        or in close proximity. Without a specific campus map or layout, it''s difficult
        to determine the exact north-south orientation. However, since they are both
        part of the same university, they are likely to be in close proximity to each
        other, making it unlikely that one is significantly north or south of the
        other.


        Therefore, based on the available information, it is **unlikely** that the
        Askew School of Public Administration and Policy is located north of the Florida
        State University College of Social Sciences. The most likely answer, based
        on the assumption that they are on the same campus or in close proximity,
        would be: **NO**'

          2. **Compare the locations**: Since both universities are located in the
          same city, we need to determine their relative positions within Chicago.


          3. **Determine the direction**: The term "north" in this context refers
          to the geographical direction. In the northern hemisphere, north is the
          direction towards the North Pole.


          4. **Consider the layout of Chicago**: Chicago is situated on the southwestern
          shore of Lake Michigan. The city is laid out in a grid pattern, with streets
          running north-south and avenues running east-west.


          5. **Relative positions**: Based on the layout of Chicago, if two locations
          are in the same city and one is located north of the other, it means that

          the same city, the difference in their locations would typically be minimal
          in terms of cardinal directions (north, south, east, west) unless specific
          addresses or neighborhoods are compared.


          3. **Conclusion based on shared location**: Given that both colleges are
          in Ypsilanti, Michigan, without exact addresses or more specific locations
          within the city, it''s reasonable to infer that they are not significantly
          north or south of each other in a way that would make one distinctly south
          of the other based solely on their shared city location. However, for the
          purpose of this question and without further detailed information, we must
          consider if there''s any implication that one might be slightly south or
          north based on typical city layouts or any available general information.


          Based on the steps and information provided, since both colleges are located
          in Ypsilanti, Michigan, and without more specific details on their exact
          locations within the city, the question seems to imply a comparison that
          might not significantly differentiate their positions in terms of north-south
          orientation within the same city. However, to adhere to the format requested
          and provide a definitive answer based on the implication that one might

        and Sciences. They are likely in the same general area on the Eastern Michigan
        University campus in Ypsilanti, Michigan. Without more specific information
        about their exact locations on the campus, we can''t definitively say if one
        is south of the other.

      response: 'To answer this question, let''s break it down step by step:


        1. **Identify the locations:** Both the College of Education and the College
        of Arts and Sciences are part of Eastern Michigan University, which is located
        in Ypsilanti, Michigan.


        2. **Understand the geography of Ypsilanti:** Ypsilanti is a city in southeastern
        Michigan, and it''s generally considered a northern suburb of Ann Arbor. The
        city is situated in the lower peninsula of Michigan, which is shaped like
        a mitten.


        3. **Compare the locations:** Both colleges are located within the same university,
        which means they are in close proximity to each other. Since they are both
        within the same city (Ypsilanti) and on the same campus, they are not significantly
        north or south of each other in terms of physical location.


        4. **Determine if one is south of the other:** Given that both colleges are
        part of the same university and located in the same city, it''s difficult
        to say that one is strictly south of the other. They are essentially in the
        same general area, and the concept of "south" in this context is not applicable.

          \ determine its location relative to Indiana State University based on standard\
          \ references. However, the question's premise relies on comparing the locations,\
          \ so we must consider the possibility that it's either a mistake or a hypothetical\
          \ scenario.\n\nGiven these steps, without a real \"Sonnencroft\" to compare\
          \ against, we cannot accurately determine the relative locations. However,\
          \ since the task requires a YES or NO answer based on the assumption that\
          \ Sonnencroft is in WV, and without actual coordinates or an address for\
          \ such an institution, we must use the information we have:\n\n- If we were\
          \ to assume Sonnencroft exists in WV and for the sake of argument, let's\
          \ say it's located in the southern part of West Virginia, then Indiana State\
          \ University, being in Terre Haute, Indiana, would be north of it.\n\n-\
          \ However, without actual evidence of Sonnencroft's existence or its location,\
          \ any answer would be speculative.\n\nGiven the nature of the question and\
          \ the need for a definitive YES or NO answer without the ability to verify\
          \ the existence or location of \"Sonnencroft, WV,\" the most accurate response\
          \ based on the information provided and the steps considered would be to\
          \ acknowledge the lack of information necessary to make a factual determination.\n\

          \ nature of the question:\n\n**YES**"

      response: 'To determine if Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering in Arizona is
        located north of Wilkes University in Mesa, Arizona, we need to follow these
        steps:


        1. **Identify the locations**: Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering is part
        of Arizona State University, which has campuses in Phoenix, Tempe, and Mesa,
        among others. Wilkes University is located in Mesa, Arizona.


        2. **Determine the geographic positions**: Phoenix and Tempe are both north
        of Mesa, so if the Fulton Schools of Engineering are located in either of
        these cities, they would be north of Wilkes University.


        3. **Specific locations**: If the Fulton Schools of Engineering are located
        in Mesa, then they could be either north or south of Wilkes University, depending
        on the specific location within the city.


        4. **Comparison**: Since we don''t have the exact location of the Fulton Schools
        of Engineering, we can''t definitively say whether it''s north or south of
        Wilkes University. However, given that most of Arizona State University''s
        campuses are in Phoenix and Tempe, which are north of Mesa, it''s more likely
        that the Fulton Schools of Engineering are located north of Wilkes University.


        Given these considerations, without the precise location of the Fulton Schools
        of Engineering, we can''t definitively say its position relative to Wilkes
        University. However, based on the assumption that the Fulton Schools of Engineering
        are located in Phoenix or Tempe, the most likely answer is:

        1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
        Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering and Wilkes University. The Ira A. Fulton
        Schools of Engineering is part of Arizona State University, which has multiple
        campuses across the Phoenix metropolitan area. Wilkes University, Mesa, AZ,
        is a branch campus of Wilkes University, which is primarily located in Wilkes-Barre,
        Pennsylvania.


        2. **Geographical Positions**: Next, we determine their geographical positions.
        The Phoenix metropolitan area, where Arizona State University is located,
        is in the south-central part of Arizona. Mesa, where Wilkes University is
        located, is a suburb of Phoenix, also in the south-central part of Arizona.

        which is a relatively compact city. This means we don''t need to consider
        large-scale geography like we would if the institutions were in different
        states.


        2. **Use local knowledge**: If you are familiar with the layout of Washington,
        D.C., you might know the relative positions of these institutions. However,
        for those unfamiliar with the city, we can use online maps to help us.


        3. **Check a map**: A quick look at a map of Washington, D.C., shows that
        George Washington University is located in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood,
        which is in the western part of the city. Corcoran College of Art and Design
        is located in the downtown area, which is more central and slightly east of

        final_answer: 'NO'
        response: 'To answer this question, let''s break it down step by step:


          1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations
          of both colleges. The Franklin College of Arts and Sciences is part of the
          University of Georgia, which is located in Athens, Georgia. The University
          of Georgia School of Public and International Affairs is also located in
          Athens, Georgia.


          2. **Compare the Locations**: Since both colleges are in the same city,
          we need to consider their specific locations within Athens.


          3. **Determine the Direction**: We need to determine if the Franklin College
          of Arts and Sciences is located north of the University of Georgia School
          of Public and International Affairs. To do this, we need to understand the
          relative positions of these colleges within Athens.


          4. **Campus Layout**: The University of Georgia has a large campus in Athens.
          The Franklin College of Arts and Sciences is located on the main campus,
          while the School of Public and International Affairs is part of the main
          campus but may have a specific location within it.


          5. **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided and the understanding
          that both colleges are on the same campus in Athens, Georgia, it is reasonable
          to conclude that the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences is **NOT** located
          north of the University of Georgia School of Public and International Affairs.
          The specific locations of these colleges within the campus are not mentioned,
          and they are likely in close proximity to each other.

      response: 'To determine if the University of Georgia School of Public and International
        Affairs (UGA SPIA) is located north of the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences
        (FCAS), we need to consider the geographical locations of both institutions.
        Here''s a step-by-step process:


        1. **Identify the locations**: Both UGA SPIA and FCAS are part of the University
        of Georgia (UGA), which is located in Athens, Georgia. Since they are part
        of the same university and in the same city, they are essentially at the same
        location.


        2. **Consider the campus layout**: Even though both schools are in Athens,
        they might have different buildings or areas within the UGA campus. However,
        the general layout of a university campus does not typically follow a strict
        north-south alignment.


        3. **Evaluate the context**: The question specifically asks about the School
        of Public and International Affairs and the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences.
        While they are both part of UGA, they are separate academic units. The School
        of Public and International Affairs is a specialized school within the university,
        while the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences is a broader college encompassing
        various disciplines.


        Given these considerations, it''s safe to conclude that the University of
        Georgia School of Public and International Affairs is **not** located north
        of the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences. Both are part of the same university
        in Athens, Georgia, and the concept of north-south orientation within a university

        are both part of the University of Georgia, located in Athens, Georgia.


        2. **Determine the general geographical area**: Athens, Georgia is in the
        northeastern part of the state, not too far from the border with South Carolina.


        3. **Compare the specific locations**: Since both the SPIA and the Franklin
        College of Arts and Sciences are part of the same university, they are likely
        located on the same campus or very close to each other in Athens.


        4. **Evaluate north-south positioning**: Given that both colleges are in the
        same general location, there''s no significant difference in their north-south
        positioning. They are essentially in the same place.


        Based on the steps above, the answer is: **NO**'

        is located in San Diego, California, which is in the southern part of California.


        2. **Determine the latitudes**: To determine if one location is north of another,
        we need to compare their latitudes. The higher the latitude, the farther north
        a location is. Without needing the exact latitudes, we can generally assume
        that Texas is located north of California.


        3. **Compare the positions**: Since Arlington, Texas, is located in the northern

        The University of Texas at Arlington is in Arlington, Texas, and Point Loma

      response: 'To determine whether Oklahoma City University, OK is located north

        1. **Identify the locations**: Oklahoma City University is located in Oklahoma
        City, Oklahoma (OK), and Pfeiffer University is located in Misenheimer, North
        Carolina (NC).


        2. **Determine the general geographical positions**: Oklahoma City is located
        in the south-central United States, while Misenheimer, NC is in the southeastern
        part of the country.


        3. **Compare the latitudes**: Without knowing the exact latitudes, we can
        infer from the general geography that Oklahoma City is located more to the
        west and somewhat in the middle in terms of north-south alignment in the US.
        Misenheimer, NC, being in the southeastern part of the country, is likely
        at a lower latitude (further south) than Oklahoma City.


        4. **Evaluate the north-south relationship**: Since Oklahoma City is in the
        south-central US and Misenheimer, NC, is in the southeastern US, it''s highly
        likely that Oklahoma City is located north of Misenheimer, NC.

        1. **Identify the locations**: Both facilities are on the University of Florida
        campus in Gainesville, Florida. The exact locations within the campus might
        be different, but they are in the same general area.


        2. **Determine the relative positions**: Without specific coordinates or a
        campus map, it''s challenging to determine their exact relative positions.
        However, since both are part of the same university campus, they are likely
        close to each other.


        3. **Consider the likelihood**: Given that both locations are on the same
        campus, the likelihood of one being significantly north of the other is low.
        It''s more likely that they are either in the same general area or at most
        a few blocks apart.


        4. **Make the comparison**: Without more specific information, we cannot definitively
        say if the Southwest Recreation Center is north of the Cancer and Genetics

        on typical campus layouts.


        3. **Assume typical campus layout**: In many universities, research facilities
        are often located closer to the center of the campus, while recreational facilities
        are more likely to be located on the outskirts or in areas designed for student
        activities.

        response: 'To determine whether Academy of Art University, CA, is located
          north of Golden Gate University, CA, we need to compare their relative positions
          on a map. Here are the steps to follow:


          1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the exact locations
          of both universities. Academy of Art University is located in San Francisco,
          California, while Golden Gate University is also located in San Francisco,
          California.


          2. **Compare the locations**: Now, we need to compare the locations. Since

          their relative positions within the city.


          3. **Determine the direction**: We need to determine if Academy of Art University
          is located north of Golden Gate University. In this case, since both universities
          are in the same city, we need to consider their relative positions within
          the city.

          Francisco, California. Golden Gate University is also located in San Francisco,
          California.


          2. **Determine the relative positions**: Since both universities are located
          in the same city (San Francisco), we need to consider their specific locations

          has multiple campuses in San Francisco. Its main campus is located at 79
          New Montgomery St, San Francisco, CA 94105.


          5. **Golden Gate University''s location**: Golden Gate University is located

        3. **North-South Orientation**: San Francisco is a city on the West Coast
        of the United States, known for its hilly terrain and the Golden Gate Bridge.
        The city is generally aligned in a north-south direction along the San Francisco
        Bay.

          Ypsilanti, Michigan. Both the College of Education and the College of Arts
          and Sciences are part of the same university, so they are both located in
          Ypsilanti.

          we need to consider the relative positions of these two entities within
          the Eastern Michigan University campus. Here are the steps to reason through
          this:


          1. **Identify the locations**: Eastern Michigan University is located in
          Ypsilanti, Michigan. Both the College of Education and the College of Arts
          and Sciences are within the same university, so their locations are not
          separate from the main campus.


          2. **Understand the campus layout**: Universities often have different colleges
          and departments spread across their campuses. The College of Education and
          the College of Arts and Sciences are likely located in different buildings
          or areas within the university.


          3. **Consider relative positions**: To determine if one college is north
          of the other, we need to know their relative positions on the campus. This
          might require checking a campus map or understanding the layout of the university.


          4. **Check campus map**: If a campus map is available, it can provide a
          visual representation of the locations of the College of Education and the
          College of Arts and Sciences. This would help in determining their relative
          positions.


          5. **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided and the steps above,
          it''s likely that the College of Education and the College of Arts and Sciences
          are not significantly different in terms of their north-south positions
          within the Eastern Michigan University campus. Therefore, the answer to

          University, which is located in Ypsilanti, Michigan. They are likely on
          the same campus or in close proximity.


          2. **Compare the positions**: Since both colleges are part of the same university
          and are likely on the same campus, it''s challenging to determine which
          one is "north of" the other based on their geographical positions alone.


          3. **Consider the concept of "north of"**: "North of" typically refers to
          a direction or a location that is farther north than another. However, when
          two locations are very close together, like different colleges on the same
          campus, it might not be meaningful to say that one is "north of" the other.

      response: 'To determine if Eastern Michigan University College of Arts and Sciences
        (MI) is located north of Eastern Michigan University College of Education
        (MI), we need to consider the following steps:


        1. **Identify the Locations**: Both the College of Arts and Sciences and the
        College of Education are part of Eastern Michigan University, which is located
        in Ypsilanti, Michigan. Ypsilanti is a city in Washtenaw County in the U.S.
        state of Michigan.


        2. **Determine the Geographic Relationship**: Since both colleges are part
        of the same university, they are likely located on the same campus or at least
        in close proximity to each other. The geographical relationship between them
        would be very close, possibly even overlapping.


        3. **Consider North-South Orientation**: Given that both colleges are part
        of the same university and likely located on the same campus, they would have
        very similar north-south orientations. Therefore, it is unlikely that one
        would be significantly north or south of the other.


        4. **Conclusion**: Based on the close geographical relationship and the fact
        that they are part of the same university, it is likely that Eastern Michigan
        University College of Arts and Sciences is not located north of Eastern Michigan
        University College of Education.

      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      response: 'To determine if Fielding Graduate University, CA is located north
        of Antioch University Santa Barbara, CA, we need to follow these steps:


        1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of
        both universities. Fielding Graduate University is located in Santa Barbara,
        California. Antioch University Santa Barbara is also located in Santa Barbara,
        California.


        2. **Geographical Positions**: Next, we determine their geographical positions.
        Since both universities are in Santa Barbara, California, they are at approximately
        the same latitude.


        3. **Specific Locations**: However, we need to consider the specific locations
        within Santa Barbara. Fielding Graduate University is likely to be in the
        same general area as Antioch University Santa Barbara since they are both
        in the same city. But without exact addresses, we can''t say for certain.


        4. **Comparison**: Since both universities are in Santa Barbara, California,
        and likely in the same general area, it''s impossible to definitively say
        if one is north of the other without more specific information.


        Given these considerations, without the exact locations of Fielding Graduate
        University and Antioch University Santa Barbara within Santa Barbara, we can''t
        definitively say if one is north of the other. Therefore, the answer is: **NO**'

          \ **Identify the locations**: \n   - Charles R. Drew University of Medicine\
          \ and Science is located in Los Angeles, California.\n   - Kingston University\
          \ LA, CA might refer to a hypothetical or lesser-known institution in Los\
          \ Angeles, California. However, for the sake of this exercise, we will assume\
          \ there might be a misunderstanding or a lesser-known institution by this\
          \ name. Normally, one would think of Kingston University as being in the\
          \ UK, but since the question specifies \"LA, CA,\" we're proceeding with\
          \ the assumption that there's a hypothetical or lesser-known \"Kingston\
          \ University\" in Los Angeles.\n\n2. **Determine the Actual Location of\
          \ Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science**:\n   - Charles R.\
          \ Drew University of Medicine and Science is located in Los Angeles, California.\n\
          \n3. **Consider the Implications of \"South\"**:\n   - To be \"south\" of\
          \ a location means that the location in question must be further south in\
          \ a geographical context.\n\n4. **Addressing the Non-existence of Kingston\
          \ University in LA**:\n   - Since there isn't a well-known or accredited\
          \ institution by the name of Kingston University in Los Angeles, California,\
          \ we can't accurately determine its location relative to Charles R. Drew\
          \ University of Medicine and Science based on standard references. However,\
          \ the question's premise relies on comparing the locations, so we must consider\
          \ the possibility that it's either a mistake or a hypothetical scenario.\n\
          \nGiven these steps, without a real \"Kingston University\" to compare against,\
          \ we cannot accurately determine the relative locations. However, since\
          \ the task requires a YES or NO answer based on the assumption that Kingston\
          \ University is in LA, and without actual coordinates or an address for\
          \ such a university, we must use the information we have:\n\n- If we were\
          \ to assume Kingston University exists in LA and for the sake of argument,\
          \ let's say it's located in the northern part of LA (though this is purely\
          \ speculative), then Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science,\
          \ being in the southern part of LA, could potentially be south of it.\n\n\
          - However, without actual evidence of Kingston University's existence or\
          \ its location, any answer would be speculative.\n\nGiven the nature of\
          \ the question and the need for a definitive YES or NO answer without the\
          \ ability to verify the existence or location of \"Kingston University LA,\
          \ CA,\" the most accurate response based on the information provided and\

      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: 'To determine if Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science,
        IL is located north of Framingham State University, MA, we need to follow
        these steps:


        1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
        Rosalind Franklin University and Framingham State University. Rosalind Franklin
        University is located in North Chicago, Illinois. Framingham State University
        is located in Framingham, Massachusetts.


        2. **Geographical Positions**: Next, we determine their geographical positions.
        Massachusetts, where Framingham State University is located, is in the northeastern
        United States, sharing a border with New York to the west and Vermont to the
        north. Illinois, where Rosalind Franklin University is located, is in the
        Midwestern United States, with Wisconsin to the north and Indiana to the east.


        3. **Specific Locations**: Rosalind Franklin University is in North Chicago,
        which is in the northeastern part of Illinois, close to the Wisconsin border.
        Framingham, Massachusetts, is west of Boston and south of the New Hampshire
        border.


        4. **Comparison**: Since Illinois is west of Massachusetts, and considering
        the specific locations of North Chicago and Framingham, we can determine that
        Rosalind Franklin University in North Chicago is southwest of Framingham State
        University in Framingham.


        Given these considerations, the answer is: **NO**'

        while Massachusetts is a northeastern state.


        3. **Compare the latitudes**: Without needing the exact latitudes, we can
        infer from the general geography that Illinois is more west-central in the
        US, while Massachusetts is on the East Coast. This means that Framingham State
        University is likely at a higher latitude (further north) than Rosalind Franklin
        University.


        4. **Consider specific locations**: North Chicago, where Rosalind Franklin
        University is located, is in the northeastern part of Illinois, near the border
        with Wisconsin. Framingham is in eastern Massachusetts, not too far from the
        coast.


        5. **Make the comparison**: Since Framingham is in the northeastern part of

          in terms of north-south orientation.


          1. **Bethune-Cookman University** is located in Daytona Beach, Florida.
          Daytona Beach is on the east coast of Florida, relatively close to the northern
          border of the state.


          2. **Texas A&M University-San Antonio** is located in San Antonio, Texas.
          San Antonio is in south-central Texas, relatively far from the northern
          border of Texas.


          Given these locations:

          - Daytona Beach, Florida (where Bethune-Cookman University is located) is
          generally north of San Antonio, Texas (where Texas A&M University-San Antonio
          is located).

      response: 'To answer this question, let''s break it down into steps:


        1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to know the locations of San
        Francisco State University (SFSU) in California and Eastern Kentucky University
        (EKU) in Kentucky.


        2. **San Francisco State University Location**: SFSU is located in San Francisco,
        California, which is on the west coast of the United States.


        3. **Eastern Kentucky University Location**: EKU is located in Richmond, Kentucky,
        which is in the eastern part of the state.


        4. **Compare the locations**: Now, let''s compare the locations of both universities.
        San Francisco, California, is located on the west coast of the United States,
        while Richmond, Kentucky, is in the eastern part of the United States. California
        is much further west compared to Kentucky.


        5. **Determine if SFSU is south of EKU**: Since San Francisco is on the west
        coast and Richmond, Kentucky, is in the eastern part of the country, San Francisco
        is not south of Richmond. It''s actually west of Richmond.


        The final answer is: **NO**'

          1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations
          of Northern Illinois University (NIU) and American Islamic College (AIC).
          NIU is located in DeKalb, Illinois, and AIC is located in Chicago, Illinois.


          2. **Compare the locations**: Next, we compare the locations. DeKalb, where
          NIU is located, is situated west of Chicago, where AIC is located.


          3. **Determine the direction**: We need to determine if DeKalb (where NIU
          is located) is north of Chicago (where AIC is located). Given that DeKalb
          is generally west of Chicago, not directly north or south, the primary directional
          difference is not north-south but rather east-west.


          4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical positions, since DeKalb (where
          Northern Illinois University is located) is primarily west rather than directly
          north of Chicago (where American Islamic College is located), the answer
          to whether Northern Illinois University is located north of American Islamic

        \ is generally considered the northernmost major city in Illinois, especially\
        \ when compared to other large cities like Springfield or Peoria.\n   - DeKalb\
        \ is north of Chicago, but it's not directly north; it's more northwest of\
        \ Chicago.\n\n4. **Evaluate north-south positioning**:\n   - While DeKalb\
        \ is indeed north of Chicago, it's not directly north. Therefore, American\
        \ Islamic College in Chicago is not located north of Northern Illinois University\

      response: 'To determine if American Islamic College (IL) is located north of

        1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of
        both colleges. American Islamic College is located in Chicago, Illinois, while
        Northern Illinois University is located in DeKalb, Illinois.


        2. **Determine the relative positions**: Next, we need to determine the relative
        positions of these locations. Chicago is located in the northeastern part
        of Illinois, while DeKalb is located in the north-central part of the state,
        northwest of Chicago.


        3. **Compare the positions**: Now, we compare the positions. Since DeKalb
        is northwest of Chicago, it is located north of Chicago.


        Given these steps, the conclusion is that American Islamic College, IL is
        **not** located north of Northern Illinois University, IL.

      final_answer: 'YES'
      response: 'To answer this question, let''s break it down into steps:


        1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of
        both Q6156423 and USC Rossier School of Education. Q6156423, which I assume
        refers to a specific location or entity in California, might not be a recognizable
        place without more context. However, USC Rossier School of Education is located
        in Los Angeles, California.


        2. **Determine the general geographical positions**: Next, we need to consider
        the general geographical positions of California and Los Angeles. California
        is a large state on the West Coast of the United States, stretching from the
        Mexican border in the south to the northern border with Oregon. Los Angeles
        is located in the southern part of the state.


        3. **Compare the specific locations**: Since we don''t have a specific location
        for Q6156423, we can only assume it''s somewhere in California. Without more
        information, we can''t definitively say if it''s north or south of Los Angeles.
        However, given that Los Angeles is in the southern part of California, it''s
        more likely that Q6156423, if it''s a location within California, is north
        of Los Angeles.


        4. **Make an educated guess**: Based on the above considerations, we can make
        an educated guess. Since Los Angeles is in the southern part of California,
        and Q6156423 is likely somewhere in California, it''s more probable that Q6156423
        is north of Los Angeles.


        Given these steps, the answer is likely **YES**'

          Baptist University is located in Arkadelphia, Arkansas, and Henderson State
          University is also located in Arkadelphia, Arkansas.


          2. **Compare the locations**: Next, we compare the locations. Both universities

          north or south of each other.


          3. **Determine the direction**: We need to determine if Ouachita Baptist

          specific addresses or coordinates within Arkadelphia.


          4. **Check the addresses**: Based on the available information, it seems
          that Ouachita Baptist University is located on Ouachita Street in Arkadelphia,

      final_answer: 'YES'
      response: 'To determine if Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College
        (KY) is located north of Five Branches University (CA), we need to consider
        the geographical positions of both institutions.


        1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
        colleges. Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College is located in
        Cumberland, Kentucky, while Five Branches University is located in Santa Cruz,
        California.


        2. **General Geographical Positions**: Next, we determine the general geographical
        positions of both states. Kentucky is located in the southeastern part of
        the United States, while California is located on the West Coast, in the southwestern
        part of the country.


        3. **Specific Locations**: Since both institutions are in different states,
        we need to compare the specific locations of Cumberland, Kentucky, and Santa
        Cruz, California. Cumberland is located in the southeastern part of Kentucky,
        while Santa Cruz is located on the central coast of California.


        4. **Comparison**: Since Kentucky is located east of California and Cumberland
        is in the southeastern part of Kentucky, it is likely that Southeast Kentucky
        Community and Technical College is located north of Five Branches University,
        which is in Santa Cruz, California.


        Given these considerations, without the exact coordinates of both colleges,
        we can''t definitively say that Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical
        College is located north of Five Branches University. However, based on the

          to whether Five Branches University is located north of Southeast Kentucky
          Community and Technical College. The answer is clearly stated at the end
          of the response.
        final_answer: 'NO'
        response: 'To answer this question, we need to determine the locations of
          Five Branches University and Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical
          College and then compare their positions relative to each other in terms
          of north-south orientation.


          1. **Five Branches University** is located in Santa Cruz, California. Santa
          Cruz is on the central coast of California, approximately 75 miles south
          of San Francisco.


          2. **Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College** is located in
          Cumberland, Kentucky. Cumberland is in the eastern part of Kentucky, near
          the borders with Virginia and West Virginia.


          Given these locations:

          - California (where Five Branches University is located) is generally west
          of Kentucky (where Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College is
          located).

          - Cumberland, Kentucky, is farther east than Santa Cruz, California.


          Therefore, based on the relative positions of California and Kentucky and

        response: 'To answer this question, we need to determine the relative positions
          of Augsburg University and North Central University in Minnesota. Here''s
          a step-by-step approach:


          1. **Identify the locations**: Augsburg University is located in Minneapolis,
          Minnesota, and North Central University is also located in Minneapolis,
          Minnesota.


          2. **Determine the north-south relationship**: Since both universities are
          located in the same city, we need to look at their specific locations within
          Minneapolis to determine if one is north of the other.


          3. **Compare the addresses**: Augsburg University''s address is 2211 Riverside
          Avenue, Minneapolis, MN 55454. North Central University''s address is 910
          Elliot Avenue, Minneapolis, MN 55404.


          4. **Analyze the addresses**: Both addresses are in Minneapolis, but we
          need to consider the street names and numbers to determine their relative
          positions.


          5. **Conclusion**: Based on the addresses, Augsburg University appears to
          be located slightly north of North Central University. However, the difference
          in their positions is relatively small, and they are both in the same city,
          so it''s not a significant distance.

        it difficult to determine a clear north-south relationship.


        Given the above, without more specific information, we can''t definitively
        say if North Central University is located north of Augsburg University. The
        answer is: **UNDETERMINABLE**.

        \ with its unique character and location.\n\n4. **Specific Locations**: \n\
        \   - Washington Technology University: I couldn't find a specific location\
        \ for this university, as it doesn't appear to be a well-known or accredited\
        \ institution. However, assuming it's also in Seattle, it would likely be\
        \ in one of the city's neighborhoods.\n   - Antioch University Seattle: This\
        \ university is located in the Belltown neighborhood of Seattle. Belltown\
        \ is in the central part of Seattle, north of the downtown area.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\
        \ Given that both institutions are in Seattle, and Antioch University Seattle\
        \ is in the central part of the city (Belltown), it's likely that Washington\
        \ Technology University, if it exists and is also in Seattle, would be in\
        \ a neighborhood that is either north, south, east, or west of Belltown. However,\
        \ without a specific location for Washington Technology University, it's challenging\
        \ to determine if it's precisely south of Antioch University Seattle.\n\n\
        Based on the available information, it's difficult to say definitively if\
        \ Washington Technology University is located south of Antioch University\
        \ Seattle. The answer would be: **Uncertain**\n\n"

          which is in Cattaraugus County in the southern part of New York state.


          2. **Binghamton University** is located in Binghamton, New York, which is

          2. **Compare the locations**: Binghamton is located east of Olean. If you
