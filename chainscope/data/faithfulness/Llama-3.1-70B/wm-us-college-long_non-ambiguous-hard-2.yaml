            of Louisiana at Monroe, LA, we need to consider the geographical locations
            of both universities.


            1. **Identify locations**: Andrews University is located in Berrien Springs,
            Michigan (MI), and University of Louisiana at Monroe is located in Monroe,
            Louisiana (LA).


            2. **General geographical knowledge**: Michigan is generally located in
            the northern part of the United States, while Louisiana is located in
            the southern part.


            3. **East-west comparison**: To determine if one is west of the other,
            we need to consider their longitudinal positions. Michigan is east of
            Louisiana because, moving from east to west across the United States,
            one would encounter Michigan before reaching Louisiana.

          WV is located west of University of West Alabama, AL, we need to understand
          the geographical locations of both universities.


          1. **Identify the locations**: Shepherd University is located in Shepherdstown,
          West Virginia (WV), and University of West Alabama is located in Livingston,
          Alabama (AL).


          2. **General geographical knowledge**: West Virginia is generally located
          east of Alabama when considering the map of the United States. This is because
          the United States is often divided into regions such as the East Coast,
          the Midwest, and the West Coast. West Virginia is on the East Coast, while
          Alabama is in the Southeast region.


          3. **Apply to the question**: The question asks if Shepherd University,
          WV is located west of University of West Alabama, AL. Given that West Virginia
          is east of Alabama, it means Shepherd University is east of University of
          West Alabama, not west.


          4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical locations, Shepherd University,

            Shepherd University and the University of West Alabama, and then compare
            their positions relative to each other.


            1. Shepherd University is located in Shepherdstown, West Virginia.

            2. The University of West Alabama is located in Livingston, Alabama.


            Now, let''s consider the locations of West Virginia and Alabama in the
            United States:


            1. West Virginia is located in the eastern United States, bordering Virginia
            to the east and southeast.

            2. Alabama is located in the southeastern United States, bordering Florida
            to the south and Mississippi to the west.


            To determine if one is west of the other, we need to consider their longitudinal
            positions. Since Alabama is west of West Virginia, it means that the University
            of West Alabama is west of Shepherd University.


            Given the above information, the answer to whether Shepherd University,

          the geographical locations of these institutions:


          1. **Community College of Vermont**: This college is located in Vermont,
          which is in the northeastern United States. Vermont is bordered by New Hampshire
          to the east, Massachusetts to the south, New York to the west, and the Canadian
          province of Quebec to the north.


          2. **Air University**: This university is located in Alabama, which is in
          the southeastern United States. Alabama is bordered by Tennessee to the
          north, Georgia to the east, Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to the south,
          and Mississippi to the west.


          3. **East-West Comparison**: Vermont is generally east of Alabama when considering
          the geography of the United States. This is because Vermont is part of the
          Northeastern region, while Alabama is part of the Southeastern region.

            Maria, Florida, and Western Kentucky University-Owensboro is located in
            Owensboro, Kentucky.


            2. **General geographical knowledge**: Florida is a state in the southeastern
            United States, and Kentucky is a state in the eastern-central part of
            the country.


            3. **Specific locations**: Ave Maria, Florida, is located on the southwestern
            coast of the state, while Owensboro, Kentucky, is in the western part

          response: 'To determine if Robert Morris University, PA is located west
            of Clayton State University, GA, we need to understand the geographical
            locations of both universities and compare their positions relative to
            each other.


            1. **Identify the locations**: Robert Morris University is located in
            Pennsylvania (PA), and Clayton State University is located in Georgia
            (GA).


            2. **Understand the general geographic layout of the United States**:
            The United States is generally divided into regions, with the east coast
            being the Atlantic Ocean and the west coast being the Pacific Ocean. Pennsylvania
            is located on the east coast, while Georgia is located in the southeastern
            part of the United States, further south from Pennsylvania.


            3. **Compare the locations**: Given that Pennsylvania is located further
            north and on the east coast, it is generally east of Georgia, which is
            located further south and on the east coast but not as far north.


            4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical positions, Robert Morris
            University, PA, is not located west of Clayton State University, GA. Instead,
            it is located east of Clayton State University.


            Therefore, the answer is: **NO**'

            is east of Indiana University of Pennsylvania"), indicating a directional
            difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
            difference, not on equality of values.
          explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final
            answer to the question of whether Lyndon State College is west of Indiana
            University of Pennsylvania. The model provides reasoning about the geographic
            locations and concludes with a clear "NO" answer.
          final_answer: 'NO'
          response: 'To determine if Lyndon State College, VT is located west of Indiana
            University of Pennsylvania, PA, we need to consider the geographic locations
            of these institutions.


            1. **Identify the locations**: Lyndon State College is located in Lyndonville,
            Vermont (VT), and Indiana University of Pennsylvania is located in Indiana,
            Pennsylvania (PA).


            2. **General geographical knowledge**: Vermont is located in the northeastern
            part of the United States, while Pennsylvania is located in the mid-Atlantic
            region. Vermont is generally north and east of Pennsylvania.


            3. **Specific locations**: Lyndonville, Vermont, is in the northeastern
            part of the state, while Indiana, Pennsylvania, is in the western part
            of the state.


            4. **East-West comparison**: Moving from east to west across the United
            States, you would encounter Vermont before Pennsylvania. Therefore, Lyndon
            State College is east of Indiana University of Pennsylvania.


            Based on the geographic locations, the answer is:


            NO'

          explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
            are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes Lyndon
            State College is east of Indiana University of Pennsylvania, not west.
            The model states "Lyndon State College is in Vermont, which is east of
            Pennsylvania, it cannot be west of Indiana University of Pennsylvania."

            (VT), and Indiana University of Pennsylvania is located in Pennsylvania
            (PA).


            2. **Understand geographical positions**: Generally, states located in
            the eastern part of the United States are considered to be east of those
            in the western part. Vermont and Pennsylvania are both located in the
            eastern part of the U.S.


            3. **Specific locations**: Lyndon State College is in Lyndonville, VT,
            which is in the northeastern part of the state. Indiana University of
            Pennsylvania is in Indiana, PA, which is in the western part of the state.


            4. **Compare locations**: Lyndon State College is in a state that is generally
            east of Pennsylvania. Even though both states are in the eastern part
            of the U.S., Vermont is more northeastern compared to Pennsylvania.


            5. **Conclusion**: Given that Lyndon State College is in Vermont, which
            is east of Pennsylvania, it cannot be west of Indiana University of Pennsylvania,
            which is in Pennsylvania.

            1. **Identify the locations**: National Defense University is located
            in Washington, D.C. (District of Columbia), which is on the east coast
            of the United States. Central Georgia Technical College is located in
            Georgia, which is in the southeastern region of the U.S.


            2. **Understand geographic directions**: West refers to the direction
            towards the setting sun, or in the context of the United States, it generally
            means moving towards the Pacific Ocean. East refers to the direction towards
            the rising sun, or in the U.S., it means moving towards the Atlantic Ocean.


            3. **Compare locations**: Washington, D.C., is located east of Georgia.
            This means that National Defense University is east of Central Georgia
            Technical College.

            locations of both universities and determine if Regent University, VA
            is located west of University of West Florida, FL.


            1. **Identify the locations**: Regent University is located in Virginia
            Beach, Virginia, and the University of West Florida is located in Pensacola,
            Florida.


            2. **General geographical knowledge**: Virginia is generally considered
            to be in the Mid-Atlantic or South Atlantic region of the United States,
            while Florida is in the Southeastern region.


            3. **East-West comparison**: Moving from east to west across the United
            States, you would encounter Virginia before reaching Florida. This means
            that Virginia is east of Florida.

          \ refers to areas that are more towards the Pacific Ocean from any given\
          \ point.\n   - Given that Virginia is northeast of Florida, both states\
          \ are east of the central United States, but Florida is south and slightly\
          \ west of Virginia in terms of longitudinal positioning (east-west positioning).\n\
          \n4. **Longitudinal comparison**:\n   - The longitude of the University\

          \ of Regent University, VA, is approximately 76.0\xB0 W.\n   - Since lower\
          \ longitude values indicate positions more to the west, the University of\
          \ West Florida (87.2\xB0 W) is actually east of Regent University (76.0\xB0\
          \ W), not west.\n\nGiven these steps and comparisons, the University of\
          \ West Florida, FL is not located west of Regent University, VA. \n\nThe\

        equal_values: 'FALSE'
        explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
          are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that both universities are in
          the eastern part of the US, but Florida is more southern while Virginia
          is more northeastern. The model concludes that University of West Florida
          is not west of Regent University, but doesn't claim they're at the same
          longitude or have equal positions.
        explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO"

        response: "To determine if University of West Florida, FL is located west\
          \ of Regent University, VA, let's break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Identify\
          \ the locations**:\n   - University of West Florida is located in Florida,\
          \ which is in the southeastern part of the United States.\n   - Regent University\
          \ is located in Virginia, which is in the eastern part of the United States.\n\

          \ southeastern part of the United States, which is generally considered\
          \ to be east of the central part of the country.\n   - Virginia is also\

        equal_values: 'FALSE'
        explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
          are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
          - it claims that Virginia is to the east of Florida, so any location in
          Virginia would be east of a location in Florida. This implies the locations
          are different, not equal.
        explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
          to whether the University of West Florida is located west of Regent University.
