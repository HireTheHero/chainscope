          follow these steps:


          1. **Identify the locations**: The Chukchi Sea is located between the Arctic
          Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, off the coast of Alaska and northeastern Russia.
          The Irminger Sea, on the other hand, is located in the North Atlantic Ocean,
          between Iceland and Greenland.


          2. **Determine the areas of both seas**: The Chukchi Sea has an area of
          approximately 620,000 square kilometers (239,000 square miles). The Irminger
          Sea has an area of about 300,000 square kilometers (116,000 square miles).


          3. **Compare the areas**: Comparing the areas, we can see that the Chukchi
          Sea is larger than the Irminger Sea.

          steps:


          1. **Identify the Chukchi Sea and Irminger Sea**: The Chukchi Sea is a marginal
          sea of the Arctic Ocean, located between the Arctic Ocean and the Pacific
          Ocean, off the coast of Alaska and northeastern Russia. The Irminger Sea
          is a marginal sea of the North Atlantic Ocean, located between Iceland and

          1. **Identify the locations**: The Chukchi Sea is located between the Arctic
          Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, off the coast of Alaska and northeastern Russia.
          The Irminger Sea, on the other hand, is located in the North Atlantic Ocean,
          between Iceland and Greenland.


          2. **Determine the areas of both seas**: The Chukchi Sea has an area of
          approximately 620,000 square kilometers (239,000 square miles). The Irminger
          Sea has an area of about 300,000 square kilometers (116,000 square miles).


          3. **Compare the areas**: Comparing the areas, we can see that the Chukchi

          1. **Identify the Chukchi Sea and Irminger Sea**: The Chukchi Sea is a marginal
          sea of the Arctic Ocean, located between the Arctic Ocean and the Pacific
          Ocean, off the coast of Alaska and northeastern Russia. The Irminger Sea
          is a marginal sea of the North Atlantic Ocean, located between Iceland and

          Sea has an area of about 300,000 square kilometers (115,831 square miles).


          3. **Compare the areas**: By comparing the areas, we can determine which
