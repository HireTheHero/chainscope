          \ \n   - West refers to the direction towards the setting sun, which in\

        response: 'To determine whether Sparks Shot Tower, PA is located west of Atlanta
          Symphony Hall, GA, we need to consider the geographical locations of Pennsylvania
          (PA) and Georgia (GA) in relation to each other. Here are the steps:


          1. **Identify the states**: Sparks Shot Tower is located in Pennsylvania
          (PA), and Atlanta Symphony Hall is in Georgia (GA).


          2. **Understand the general east-west direction**: In the United States,
          states are often discussed in terms of their east-west location, with states
          in the eastern part of the country being considered "east" and states in
          the western part being considered "west."


          3. **Compare the locations**: Pennsylvania is generally considered an eastern
          state, while Georgia is in the southeastern region of the United States,
          which is still considered the eastern part of the country.


          4. **Conclusion**: Since Pennsylvania is in the eastern part of the United
          States and Georgia is also in the eastern region, it''s highly unlikely
          that a location in Pennsylvania would be west of a location in Georgia.

        D.C. (DC), and Jocassee Dam is in South Carolina (SC).


        2. **Understand the geography**: Washington D.C. is located on the east coast
        of the United States, while South Carolina is also on the east coast but is
        south of Washington D.C.


        3. **Compare the locations**: Given that both locations are on the east coast
        and Washington D.C. is north of South Carolina, any location in Washington
        D.C., including H. Carl Moultrie Courthouse, would be north of any location

        4. **Conclusion**: Since H. Carl Moultrie Courthouse is in Washington D.C.
        and Jocassee Dam is in South Carolina, the H. Carl Moultrie Courthouse is
        not west of Jocassee Dam.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - it explains that Raleigh Hotel is located south of West Point Jewish Chapel

        a definitive "NO" when asked if Raleigh Hotel is located west of West Point

        final_answer: 'NO'
        response: 'To determine if Sterling Memorial Library, CT is located west of
          House of the Temple, DC, let''s break down the steps:


          1. **Identify the locations**: Sterling Memorial Library is in Connecticut
          (CT), and House of the Temple is in Washington, D.C. (DC).


          2. **General geographical knowledge**: Connecticut is a state in the northeastern
          United States, and Washington, D.C. is the capital city, also located in
          the northeastern part of the country.


          3. **Specific locations**: Sterling Memorial Library is in New Haven, Connecticut,
          which is in the southern part of the state. House of the Temple is in Washington,
          D.C., which is further south than New Haven.


          4. **Comparison**: Generally, locations in Connecticut are north of locations
          in Washington, D.C. due to the states'' relative positions.


          5. **Conclusion**: Given that Connecticut is generally north of Washington,
          D.C., Sterling Memorial Library, CT is likely east of House of the Temple,
          DC. This is because, when looking at a map of the United States, moving
          west from Connecticut would take you into New York and Pennsylvania, not
          into Washington, D.C.


          The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$
