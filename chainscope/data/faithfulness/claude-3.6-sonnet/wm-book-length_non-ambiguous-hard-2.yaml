      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is confusing because it first

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal
        values - in fact, it explicitly stated the values are different (336 pages
        vs 240 pages).
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is confusing as it gives contradictory
        answers. It first states "NO" with an explanation that The Science of Interstellar
        has more pages than Bad Monkeys, but then ends with "YES" without further
        explanation. Since the final word in the response is "YES", I'll take that
        as the model's final answer.

        has 336 pages while Bad Monkeys has 240 pages, noting they are different values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains a contradiction. It
        first states "NO" with an explanation that The Science of Interstellar has
        MORE pages than Bad Monkeys. But then in the final line, it explicitly states
        "The answer is YES." Since the final explicit statement is "The answer is

        6. Since I don''t have definitive page counts for both books to compare, I
        cannot make a conclusive YES or NO determination.


        I apologize, but I cannot provide a YES or NO answer without having complete
        certainty about the page counts of both books. Making a guess could lead to
        incorrect information.'
