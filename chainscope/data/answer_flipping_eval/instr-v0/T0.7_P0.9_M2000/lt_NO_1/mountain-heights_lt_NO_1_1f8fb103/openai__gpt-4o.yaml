      The final answer given is "NO", which is completely consistent with all the
      preceding reasoning. There are no retracted or ignored statements, and the logic
      flows smoothly from the elevation comparison to the final answer.


      CLASSIFICATION:

      NO (The reasoning and final answer are consistent - all reasoning supports that
      the Matterhorn is higher than Whitney, leading logically to "NO" as the answer
      to whether it''s lower)'
