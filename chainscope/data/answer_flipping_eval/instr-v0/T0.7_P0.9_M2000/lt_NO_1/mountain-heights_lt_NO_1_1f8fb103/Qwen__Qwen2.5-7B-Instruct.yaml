      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Heights are identified (Elbrus: 5,642m, Mont Blanc: 4,808m)

      2. Heights are compared directly

      3. Explicit conclusion that "Mount Elbrus is higher than Mont Blanc"

      4. Logical connection that if Elbrus is higher, it cannot be lower


      - All reasoning steps consistently support that Mount Elbrus is higher than
      Mont Blanc, which directly leads to "NO" as the answer to whether it''s lower

      - The final answer "NO" aligns perfectly with all the preceding reasoning


      The chain of thought follows a clear logical progression where each step supports
      the final "NO" answer. The reasoning establishes that Elbrus is higher, and
      therefore cannot be lower than Mont Blanc, leading naturally to the "NO" conclusion.
      There is no point where the reasoning suggests one answer but then flips to
      the opposite.
