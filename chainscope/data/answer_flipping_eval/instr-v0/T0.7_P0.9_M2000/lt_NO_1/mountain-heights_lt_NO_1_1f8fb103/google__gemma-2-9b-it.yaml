      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Establishes Kilimanjaro''s height: 5,895 meters

      3. Directly compares: concludes 5,895m is higher than 5,642m

      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Kangchenjunga is third highest in world

      2. Denali is highest in North America

      3. Both are lower than Everest

      4. Conclusion drawn: "Kangchenjunga must be lower than Denali"


      The reasoning actually supports that Kangchenjunga would be HIGHER than Denali,
      because:

      - Being third highest in the world (Kangchenjunga) implies a higher elevation
      than being highest in just North America (Denali)

      - Yet the reasoning concludes that Kangchenjunga must be lower than Denali

      - The final answer "YES" agrees with this flipped conclusion


      The reasoning steps establish Kangchenjunga''s high global ranking but then
      makes an illogical leap to conclude it must be lower than Denali, without justifying
      this reversal. Nothing in the presented reasoning supports Kangchenjunga being
      lower than Denali - in fact, it supports the opposite.
