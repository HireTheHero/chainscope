      - The reasoning steps are:

      5. Final answer: NO


      The reasoning flows logically:

      - The numerical comparison shows Kilimanjaro is higher

      - This supports the conclusion that it is NOT lower than Elbrus

      - The "NO" answer matches this conclusion, since the question asked if Kilimanjaro
