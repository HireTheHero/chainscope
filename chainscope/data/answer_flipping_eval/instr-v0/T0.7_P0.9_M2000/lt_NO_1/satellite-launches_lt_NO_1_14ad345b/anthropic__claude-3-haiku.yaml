      - Both the reasoning and conclusion consistently support that Vanguard 1 preceded
      Luna 1


      CLASSIFICATION:

      NO


      The reasoning follows a clear logical path from establishing dates to comparing
      them, and arrives at a conclusion that is completely consistent with that reasoning.
      There is no point where the answer suddenly flips or contradicts the preceding
      logic.'
