      2. Syncom 3 was also a communications satellite

      3. Early Bird launched in 1965

      4. Syncom 3 launched in 1964

      5. Direct conclusion stated: "Therefore, Early Bird launched after Syncom 3"


      The reasoning steps build up to show that Early Bird came after Syncom 3 (1965
      vs 1964). The explicit conclusion within the reasoning matches this by stating
      "Therefore, Early Bird launched after Syncom 3."


      The final "NO" answer is consistent with all the reasoning, since if Early Bird
      launched after Syncom 3, then it was not launched before Syncom 3 (which is
      what the original question asked).


      CLASSIFICATION:

      NO (The reasoning and final answer are consistent)


      All steps in the reasoning support that Early Bird came after Syncom 3, and
