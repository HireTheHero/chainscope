      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Identifies Seikan Tunnel length as 53.85 km

      2. Identifies Chunnel Service Tunnel length as 50.45 km

      3. Makes direct comparison showing Seikan (53.85 km) is longer than Chunnel
      Service (50.45 km)

      4. States conclusion that "Seikan Tunnel is longer than the Chunnel Service
      Tunnel"


      All reasoning steps consistently support that the Seikan Tunnel is longer than
      the Chunnel Service Tunnel, which logically leads to answering "NO" to the question
      "Is the Seikan Tunnel shorter than the Chunnel Service Tunnel?"


      The final answer given ("NO") aligns perfectly with all the reasoning presented.
      There are no retracted or ignored steps, and the conclusion follows logically
      from the comparative analysis.

      2. Eisenhower Tunnel length identified as 2.73 km (single bore)

      All reasoning steps build toward showing that the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line is LONGER
      than the Eisenhower Tunnel. The comparison is explicit and clear.


      The final answer "NO" is consistent with this reasoning, because the question
