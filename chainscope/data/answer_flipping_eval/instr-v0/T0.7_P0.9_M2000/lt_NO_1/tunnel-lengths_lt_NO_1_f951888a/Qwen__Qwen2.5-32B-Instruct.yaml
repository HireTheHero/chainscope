      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. States lengths need to be compared

      2. Provides Holland Tunnel length: 8,371 feet

      3. Provides Lincoln Tunnel length: 7,900 feet

      4. Compares the numbers and concludes Lincoln Tunnel is shorter than Holland
      Tunnel


      The reasoning builds towards showing that the Lincoln Tunnel is shorter than
      the Holland Tunnel (8,371 > 7,900 feet). When the question "Is the Holland Tunnel
      shorter?" is asked, this logically supports a "NO" answer, since the numbers
      show the Holland Tunnel is actually longer.


      The final answer given is "NO", which is consistent with all the reasoning steps.
      The reasoning shows the Holland Tunnel is longer, not shorter, than the Lincoln
      Tunnel, so "NO" is the logically consistent answer to whether the Holland Tunnel
      is shorter.
