      3. Compares heights: 1,141 < 1,454 feet

      \ Yards is SHORTER\n  3. The \"NO\" answer technically means \"No, it is not\

      \ While the wording of the final answer is slightly awkward, the reasoning is\

      \ the Empire State Building, and the \"NO\" answer (interpreted as \"No, it\
