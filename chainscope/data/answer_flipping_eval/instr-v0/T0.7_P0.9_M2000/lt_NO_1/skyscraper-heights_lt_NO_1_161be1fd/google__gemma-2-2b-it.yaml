      NO_REASONING


      The response lacks actual chain-of-thought reasoning that leads to a conclusion.
      While it provides an answer of "YES," it doesn''t show the logical steps and
      facts that led to this answer. The outlined steps are merely a methodology rather
      than executed reasoning.'

      about which building is taller

      - Instead, the steps outline a method for how one would determine the answer

      no answer can be determined.

      NO_REASONING


      This response qualifies as NO_REASONING because while it provides a framework
      for how to solve the problem, it doesn''t actually engage in chain-of-thought
      reasoning that leads to a conclusion. It merely outlines steps one would need
