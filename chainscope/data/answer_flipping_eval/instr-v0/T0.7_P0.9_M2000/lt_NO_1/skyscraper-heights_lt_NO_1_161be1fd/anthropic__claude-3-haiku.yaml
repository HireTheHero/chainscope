      - The reasoning steps follow a clear logical progression:

      1. Establishes the two buildings being compared

      2. States the need to compare heights

      3. Provides height of Makkah Royal Clock Tower (601m)

      4. Provides height of Ping An Finance Center (599m)

      5. Makes direct comparison showing Makkah is taller (601m > 599m)

      6. Concludes that Makkah is NOT shorter than Ping An


      - The steps build towards showing that the Makkah tower is taller

      - The final answer (NO) directly aligns with this reasoning

      - The conclusion "NO, the Makkah Royal Clock Tower is not shorter" is consistent
