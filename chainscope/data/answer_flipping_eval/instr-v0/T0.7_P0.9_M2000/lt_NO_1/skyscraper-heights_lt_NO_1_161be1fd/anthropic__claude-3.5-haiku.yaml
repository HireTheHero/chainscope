      taller by 2 meters"

      4. Concludes with "NO"


      The reasoning consistently builds toward showing that the Makkah Tower is taller
      (601m > 599m), not shorter. The intermediate conclusion ("No, it is slightly
      taller") aligns perfectly with this reasoning. The final "NO" answer is also
      consistent with this logic, as the question asked if Makkah Tower was shorter,
      and the evidence showed it was taller.
