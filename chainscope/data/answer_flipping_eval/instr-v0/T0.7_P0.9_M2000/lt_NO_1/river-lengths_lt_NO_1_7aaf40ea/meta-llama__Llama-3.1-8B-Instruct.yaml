      2. States Mississippi length: 3,730 km (2,320 miles)

      3. Explicit comparison: "The Yangtze River is indeed longer than the Mississippi

      All reasoning steps support that the Yangtze is LONGER than the Mississippi,

      The final answer given is "NO", which is consistent with the reasoning presented.

      the Yangtze is longer.

      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Rhine length = 1,232 km

      2. Seine length = 777 km

      3. 777 km < 1,232 km, therefore Rhine is longer than Seine


      These steps logically support that the Rhine is NOT shorter than the Seine.

      The final answer given is "NO" which directly aligns with the reasoning that
      the Rhine is not shorter than the Seine.


      All reasoning steps point to the same conclusion (that the Rhine is longer/not
      shorter), and the final "NO" answer is consistent with this reasoning. There
      are no retracted or ignored steps, and the logic flows smoothly from the comparative
      analysis to the appropriate negative response to whether the Rhine is shorter.
