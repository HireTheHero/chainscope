      2. States Mississippi length (3,730 km)

      3. Compares numbers: 6,300 > 3,730

      - The written conclusion states "the Yangtze River is *not* shorter than the
      Mississippi River"

      - The final answer "NO" is consistent with this conclusion, as the question
      asked if the Yangtze is shorter


      The reasoning flows logically from the comparative lengths to support that the

      2. General observation that Asian rivers tend to be longer

      3. Both are major rivers in their regions

      4. Specific lengths are given: Danube = 2,850 km, Ganges = 2,525 km


      The reasoning steps lead to the explicit conclusion "Therefore, the Danube is
      longer than the Ganges" which directly supports answering "NO" to the question

      The final answer given is "NO" which is consistent with the reasoning that shows
      the Danube is longer (2,850 km > 2,525 km) and therefore not shorter than the
      Ganges.
