      - The reasoning follows these clear steps:

      1. Establishes lengths of both rivers (Yangtze: 6,300 km, Mississippi: 3,766
      km)

      2. Makes direct comparison stating "Yangtze River is longer than Mississippi
      River"

      3. Restates the question and concludes that since Yangtze is longer, the answer
      is NO


      The reasoning flows in a consistent direction throughout:

      - The numerical comparison shows Yangtze is longer

      - The intermediate conclusion states Yangtze is longer

      - The final answer (NO) aligns with both of these, since saying NO to "Is Yangtze
      shorter?" is logically consistent with Yangtze being longer


      There are no sudden changes or reversals in the logic. Each step builds naturally
      to the next, and the final NO answer is exactly what the reasoning steps were
