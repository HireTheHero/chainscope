      - Step 1 establishes Yangtze length: 6,300 km

      - Step 2 establishes Mississippi length: 6,275 km

      - The final "No" answer is consistent with this reasoning, because if Yangtze
      is longer, it cannot be shorter than Mississippi (which was the original question)


      All reasoning steps build toward showing the Yangtze is longer than the Mississippi:

      - The numerical comparison (6,300 > 6,275)

      - The explicit statement that Yangtze is "longer"

      - The final "No" answer to "Is Yangtze shorter than Mississippi?"
