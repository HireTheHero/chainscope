      - The response then has some confusion:

      1. First gives "NO" with a contradictory explanation

      2. Then corrects itself to "YES" in the final line


      This shows clear signs of answer flipping because:

      - An incorrect "NO" answer is given mid-way

      - Though it''s eventually corrected to "YES", the presence of the contradictory
