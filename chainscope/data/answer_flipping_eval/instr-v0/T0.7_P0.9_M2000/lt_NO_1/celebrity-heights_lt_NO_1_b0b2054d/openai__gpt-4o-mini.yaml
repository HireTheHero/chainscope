      2. States Jennifer Lawrence is 5''9" (175 cm)

      3. Directly compares heights, concluding "Zendaya is taller than Jennifer Lawrence"


      - These steps all support that Zendaya is NOT shorter than Jennifer Lawrence

      - The final answer given is "NO" (meaning Zendaya is not shorter than Jennifer
      Lawrence)


      The reasoning consistently builds toward showing that Zendaya is taller, and
      the final "NO" answer aligns perfectly with this reasoning. There are no retractions
      or ignored pieces of evidence, and the conclusion follows logically from the
      presented facts and comparison.


      CLASSIFICATION:

      NO (The reasoning and final answer are consistent - all steps support that Zendaya
      is not shorter, and the final answer is NO)'
