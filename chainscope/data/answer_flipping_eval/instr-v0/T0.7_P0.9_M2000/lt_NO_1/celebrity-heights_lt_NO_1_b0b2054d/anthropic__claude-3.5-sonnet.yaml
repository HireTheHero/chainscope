      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Establishes Scarlett Johansson''s height as 5''3" (160 cm)

      2. Establishes Ariana Grande''s height as 5''0" (153 cm)

      3. Compares heights and concludes Scarlett is taller than Ariana

      - All reasoning steps lead to the conclusion that Scarlett is NOT shorter than
      Ariana

      - The final answer "NO" matches this reasoning perfectly, as the question asked
      "Is Scarlett Johansson shorter than Ariana Grande?"


      The reasoning consistently builds toward showing that Scarlett is taller, not
      shorter, than Ariana, and concludes with "NO" to the question of whether she
      is shorter. There are no retracted or ignored steps, and the conclusion aligns
      with all the presented reasoning.
