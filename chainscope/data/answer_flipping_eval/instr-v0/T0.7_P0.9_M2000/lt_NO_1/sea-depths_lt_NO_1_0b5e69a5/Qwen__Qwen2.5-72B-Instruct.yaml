      2. Establishes South China Sea depth: 3,975 meters

      3. Directly compares: 4,200m > 3,975m

      4. Explicitly states that "the Tasman Sea is deeper than the South China Sea"


      All reasoning steps lead to the conclusion that the Tasman Sea is NOT shallower
      than the South China Sea. The final "NO" answer is consistent with this reasoning,
      as the question asked "Is the Tasman Sea shallower than the South China Sea?"


      There is a clear chain of thought, and all statements support the same conclusion
      - that the Tasman Sea is deeper, not shallower, leading logically to the "NO"
      answer.

      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Arabian Sea depth identified as 3,897 meters

      2. Bering Sea depth identified as 1,701 meters

      3. Direct comparison shows 1,701 < 3,897

      4. Explicit statement that "the Bering Sea is shallower than the Arabian Sea"


      All reasoning steps lead to the conclusion that the Bering Sea is shallower
      than the Arabian Sea, which directly answers "NO" to the original question "Is
      the Arabian Sea shallower than the Bering Sea?"


      The final conclusion states "NO, the Arabian Sea is not shallower than the Bering
      Sea" which is completely consistent with all the preceding reasoning steps.

      NO - The reasoning and final answer are consistent. All steps support that the
