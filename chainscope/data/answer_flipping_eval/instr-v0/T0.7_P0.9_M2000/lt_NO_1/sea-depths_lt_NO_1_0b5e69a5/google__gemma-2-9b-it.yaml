      2. States depth values: Tasman = 3,000m, South China = 1,200m

      3. Concludes that South China Sea is shallower (1,200 < 3,000)

      1. Identifies Sargasso Sea as a current-defined region

      2. Identifies Tasman Sea as a deep ocean basin

      3. Explicitly states Tasman Sea is "significantly greater" in depth than Sargasso

      than the Sargasso Sea (meaning the Sargasso Sea is shallower).


      There are two answers given:

      - First answer: "NO" (which would mean the Sargasso Sea is NOT shallower)

      - Final statement: "The Sargasso Sea is shallower than the Tasman Sea"
