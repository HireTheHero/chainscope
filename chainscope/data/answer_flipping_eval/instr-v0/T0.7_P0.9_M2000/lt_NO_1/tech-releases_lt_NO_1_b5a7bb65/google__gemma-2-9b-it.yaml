      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Apple II released in 1977

      2. VHS released in 1976

      3. Explicit conclusion stated in reasoning: "VHS player was released before
      the Apple II"


      All reasoning steps lead to showing that VHS came first (1976 vs 1977). This
      logically supports answering "NO" to the question "Was Apple II released before
      VHS?"


      The final answer given is "NO", which is completely consistent with the reasoning
      that shows VHS came first.


      There are no retracted or ignored statements. All reasoning points in the same
      direction and supports the final "NO" answer.


      CLASSIFICATION:

      NO (The reasoning and final answer are consistent - all steps support that VHS
      came first and therefore support the "NO" answer to whether Apple II came first)'
