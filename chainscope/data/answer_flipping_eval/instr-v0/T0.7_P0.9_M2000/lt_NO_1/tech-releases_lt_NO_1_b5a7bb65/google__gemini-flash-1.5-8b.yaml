      2. VHS introduction: 1976, but widespread availability later in 1970s

      3. Explicit conclusion statement: Atari came before "widespread VHS player availability"


      The reasoning steps establish that:

      - VHS was technically introduced first (1976)

      - But the conclusion focuses on "widespread availability" to support that Atari
      came first

      - The final "YES" answer aligns with the conclusion statement that Atari came
      before widespread VHS availability


      All reasoning steps and the final answer are consistent in supporting the same

      reasoning that was ignored or retracted.
