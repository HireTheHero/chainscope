      2. ZX Spectrum released in 1982

      3. Compares dates: 1982 comes before 1983

      4. Concludes ZX Spectrum was released before DynaTAC


      The question asks if DynaTAC was released before ZX Spectrum. All reasoning
      steps support that DynaTAC came AFTER the ZX Spectrum (1983 vs 1982), which
      should lead to a "NO" answer. However, the final answer given is "YES", which
      contradicts all the reasoning presented.


      There are no retracted or ignored steps - all reasoning points consistently
      to the DynaTAC being released AFTER the ZX Spectrum, but the answer states "YES"
      to whether it came before.
