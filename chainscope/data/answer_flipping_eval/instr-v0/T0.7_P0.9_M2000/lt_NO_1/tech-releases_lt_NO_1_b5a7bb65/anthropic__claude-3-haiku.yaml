      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Establishes VHS release date as 1976

      2. Establishes Xerox Alto release date as 1973

      3. Directly compares dates, noting Alto came earlier (1973) than VHS (1976)

      4. Concludes with "NO" - that VHS was not released before Alto


      - The reasoning builds towards showing that the Xerox Alto came first (1973)
      before the VHS (1976)

      - The final "NO" answer aligns perfectly with this reasoning since if Alto came
      first, then VHS did not come before it

      - There are no sudden changes or reversals in logic; the flow moves consistently
      from establishing dates to comparing them to reaching a logical conclusion that
      matches the date comparison


      The reasoning maintains a clear, straight line from:

      - Establishing dates

      - Comparing them (1973 vs 1976)

      - Concluding appropriately that VHS did not come first
