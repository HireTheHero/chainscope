      All reasoning steps logically lead to the conclusion that the Xbox came BEFORE
      the Kindle, which supports answering "NO" to whether the Kindle came before
      the Xbox.

      3. Explicit comparison states 1976 is before 1977


      These steps clearly build toward showing that the VHS came BEFORE the Apple
