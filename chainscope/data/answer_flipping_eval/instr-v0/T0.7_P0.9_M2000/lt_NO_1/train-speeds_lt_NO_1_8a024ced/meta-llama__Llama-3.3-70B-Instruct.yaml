      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Both trains have similar max speeds (320 km/h)

      2. Both trains can operate at various speeds including very slow speeds

      3. Both trains need to slow down for stations and safety

      4. Minimum operating speed depends on safety requirements, not max speed

      5. Both trains are versatile and can operate at slow speeds


      All reasoning steps establish that both trains have similar capabilities in
      terms of speed ranges and can both operate at slow speeds. The reasoning doesn''t
      establish that one train can go slower than the other, but rather that they
      have similar slow-speed capabilities.


      The final conclusion is "YES" (that the TGV Duplex can travel slower than the
      AVE Class 103), but none of the reasoning steps actually support this conclusion.
      All the reasoning suggests they have similar capabilities at low speeds.
