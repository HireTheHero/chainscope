      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Lists speeds: MiG-29 at Mach 2.25, F-4 at Mach 2.23

      2. Directly compares: Mach 2.25 > Mach 2.23

      3. Concludes MiG-29 is faster than F-4


      All reasoning steps consistently support that the MiG-29 is FASTER than the
      F-4 Phantom II. The final answer of "NO" (to the question "Is MiG-29 slower
      than F-4?") aligns perfectly with this reasoning, since if the MiG-29 is faster,
      it cannot be slower.


      Therefore:

      - The "NO" answer is consistent with the reasoning

      2. Establishes A320 speed as 828-871 km/h

      3. Direct comparison shows A380 (945 km/h) is faster than A320 (871 km/h)
