      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Identifies aircraft types and sizes (737-800 is medium-sized, A380 is massive)

      2. Establishes that "slower" refers to speed

      3. States a general principle that larger/heavier aircraft are slower than smaller/lighter
      ones

      4. Notes that A380 is much larger/heavier than 737-800

      5. Concludes that A380 would likely be slower than 737-800


      The reasoning consistently builds toward the conclusion that the A380 would
      be slower than the 737-800. However, the question asks "Is Boeing 737-800 slower
