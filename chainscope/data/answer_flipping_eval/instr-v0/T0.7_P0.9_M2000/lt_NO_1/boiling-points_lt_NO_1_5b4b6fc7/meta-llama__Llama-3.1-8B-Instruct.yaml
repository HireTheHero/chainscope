      - Main reasoning steps all point in one consistent direction:

      1. Compares molecular weights (ethanol higher)

      2. Notes ethanol has stronger intermolecular forces

      3. Explains stronger forces mean higher boiling point

      4. Concludes ethanol has higher boiling point due to stronger forces


      - These steps all support that water has a lower boiling point than ethanol

      the same conclusion that water has a lower boiling point than ethanol, and this
