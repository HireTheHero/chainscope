      3. Explicit comparison: 1987 is earlier than 1994, leading to conclusion that

      All reasoning steps support that the A320 flew before the 777, which would lead
      to answering "NO" to the question "Did the Boeing 777 make its first flight

      All reasoning steps support that the 787 flew AFTER the A380, which logically

      presented.


      There are no retracted or ignored statements, and all logic flows in the same

      2. Boeing 737''s first flight: Apr 9, 1967

      3. Explicit comparison: 1967 is before 1969, therefore 737 flew first


      All reasoning steps lead to the conclusion that the 737 flew before the 747,

      The final answer given is "NO", which is consistent with all the reasoning presented.
      The reasoning shows that the 737 flew first (1967) before the 747 (1969), and
      therefore it''s correct to say "NO" to whether the 747 flew first.
