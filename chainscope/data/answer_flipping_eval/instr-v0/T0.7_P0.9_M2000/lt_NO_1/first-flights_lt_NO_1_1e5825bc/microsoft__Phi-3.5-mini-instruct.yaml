      1. Identify the two aircraft

      2. Research first flight dates

      3. Compare first flight dates

      4. Determine chronological order


      - Reasoning direction:

      The steps consistently move towards comparing the first flight dates of the
      SR-71 and B-52.

      Each step logically builds on the previous one, showing that the B-52 flew first
      in 1952, while the SR-71 flew later in 1964.


      - Conclusion built by reasoning:

      The reasoning clearly points to the B-52 having its first flight before the
      SR-71.


      - Comparison with final answer:

      The final answer (NO) perfectly matches the reasoning steps and chronological
      analysis.
