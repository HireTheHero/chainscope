      2. Context about Spirit of St. Louis

      4. Direct comparison showing 1927 comes after 1903


      All reasoning steps support that the Spirit of St. Louis came AFTER the Wright
      Flyer, not before. This logically leads to a "NO" answer to the question "Did
      the Spirit of St. Louis make its first flight before the Wright Flyer?"


      The final answer given is "NO" which is consistent with all the reasoning presented.
      There are no retracted or ignored steps, and the conclusion follows directly
