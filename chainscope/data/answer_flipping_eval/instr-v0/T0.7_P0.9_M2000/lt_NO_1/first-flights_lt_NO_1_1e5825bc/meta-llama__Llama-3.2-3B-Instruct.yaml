      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Boeing 737 first flight: Feb 9, 1967

      2. SR-71 first flight: Dec 22, 1964

      3. Explicit comparison concludes SR-71 flew first


      The reasoning steps lead to the conclusion that the SR-71 flew before the 737,
      which logically supports answering "NO" to the question "Did the Boeing 737
      make its first flight before the SR-71?"


      The final answer given is "NO", which is consistent with the reasoning presented.
      All steps support the same conclusion that the SR-71 flew first, and therefore
      the 737 did not fly before it.

      The chain of thought follows a clear logical progression from establishing the
