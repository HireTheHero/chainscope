      3. Explicitly concludes "The Boeing 777 clearly preceded the Airbus A380"


      All reasoning steps support that the Boeing 777 flew first (1994) before the
      A380 (2005). This logically leads to answering "NO" to the question "Did the
      A380 fly first?" The final "NO" answer is consistent with all the reasoning
      presented.


      There are no retracted or ignored statements. The chronological comparison is

      "NO" to whether the A380 flew first.
