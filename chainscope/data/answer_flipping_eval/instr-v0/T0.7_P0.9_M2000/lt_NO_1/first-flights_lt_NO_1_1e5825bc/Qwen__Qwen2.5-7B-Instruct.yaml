      4. Concludes 737 flew before 747


      These steps all build toward the conclusion that the 737 flew first (before

      question asked if the 747 flew before the 737. When the reasoning shows the
      737 flew first, answering "NO" to whether the 747 flew first is logically consistent.

      conclusion that aligns with the final answer.
