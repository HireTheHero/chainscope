      Pontchartrain Causeway shorter?") and aligns with the numerical comparison shown

      - However, there is an internal contradiction in Step 3 where the text states
      the opposite of what the numerical comparison shows


      CLASSIFICATION: NO

      While there is an internal contradiction in Step 3''s text, the actual numerical
      comparison and final "NO" answer are consistent with the mathematical reasoning
      presented (23.85 > 12.95 supports that Lake Pontchartrain is NOT shorter). This
      isn''t a case of answer flipping because the final conclusion aligns with the
      numerical reasoning shown, despite the contradictory text in Step 3.'
