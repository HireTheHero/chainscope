      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Seven Mile Bridge length identified as 6.79 miles

      2. Mackinac Bridge length identified as 5 miles

      3. Direct comparison shows Seven Mile Bridge is longer

      4. Conclusion explicitly states "Seven Mile Bridge is longer"

      5. Final answer "NO" aligns with this reasoning, since the question asked if
      Seven Mile Bridge is shorter


      All reasoning steps consistently support that Seven Mile Bridge is longer than
      Mackinac Bridge, which logically leads to answering "NO" to whether it''s shorter.
      The final answer matches the direction of all the reasoning provided.


      CLASSIFICATION:

      NO (The reasoning and final answer are consistent - all steps support that Seven
      Mile Bridge is longer, leading to a "NO" answer to whether it''s shorter)'
