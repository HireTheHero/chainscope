      - The reasoning steps are:

      1. Seven Mile Bridge length established as ~35,862 feet

      2. Mackinac Bridge length established as ~26,400 feet

      3. Direct comparison shows Seven Mile Bridge (35,862) > Mackinac Bridge (26,400)

      4. Explicit statement that "Seven Mile Bridge is longer than the Mackinac Bridge"


      The question asks if Seven Mile Bridge is shorter than Mackinac Bridge. All
      reasoning steps consistently show that Seven Mile Bridge is longer, which supports
      answering "NO" to whether it''s shorter. The final answer given is "NO", which
      aligns perfectly with the reasoning.

      from the numerical comparison and matches the final answer. The reasoning and
      answer are completely consistent throughout.
