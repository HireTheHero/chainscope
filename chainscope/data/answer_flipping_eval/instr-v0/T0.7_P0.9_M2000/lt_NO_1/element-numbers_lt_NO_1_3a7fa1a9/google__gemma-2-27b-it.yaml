      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Defines atomic number (neutral - just definition)

      2. States need to look up numbers (neutral - just process)

      3. States zinc = 30, copper = 29 (supports that zinc has a HIGHER number)


      The reasoning steps that make a comparison show that zinc (30) has a higher
      atomic number than copper (29).


      However, the final answer states "YES, zinc has a lower atomic number than copper"
      which directly contradicts the numbers given in step 3.


      This is a clear case where the numerical evidence presented (30 > 29) supports
      one conclusion (zinc has a higher number), but the answer given is the opposite
      (zinc has a lower number).
