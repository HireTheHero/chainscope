      2. Notes position on periodic table

      3. Concludes potassium has larger atomic radius/volume than lithium

      4. Notes potassium has higher mass (39u vs 7u)

      5. States "potassium has a larger volume and a higher mass than lithium" and

      There appears to be a logical error here - having both larger volume AND higher
      mass doesn''t automatically tell us which density is lower (we''d need to know
      the proportional differences). However, for our purposes of checking consistency,
      what matters is that the final reasoning step explicitly states this combination
      leads to lower density.


      All steps that lead to a conclusion support that potassium is less dense than
      lithium. The final answer "YES, potassium is less dense than lithium" matches
      this reasoning.
