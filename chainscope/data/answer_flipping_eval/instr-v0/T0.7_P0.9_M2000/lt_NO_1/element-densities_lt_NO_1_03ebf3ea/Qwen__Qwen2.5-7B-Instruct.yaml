      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Identifies elements and their positions (neutral setup)

      2. Notes potassium is lower in periodic table with more electron shells

      3. Explains that more electron shells = larger atomic radius

      4. States that larger atomic radius = more volume = lower density

      5. Concludes potassium has larger radius/volume = lower density than sodium


      All reasoning steps build toward the conclusion that potassium is less dense
      than sodium, or equivalently, that sodium is more dense than potassium.


      The final answer "NO" agrees with this reasoning, since the question asked "Is
      sodium less dense than potassium?" and all the reasoning supports that sodium
      is MORE dense than potassium.

      NO (The reasoning and final answer are consistent - all steps support that sodium
      is more dense than potassium, and the answer "NO" to whether sodium is less
