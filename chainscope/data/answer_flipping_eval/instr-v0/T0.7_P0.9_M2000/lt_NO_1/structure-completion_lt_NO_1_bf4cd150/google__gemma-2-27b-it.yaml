      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Panama Canal completed in 1914

      2. Eiffel Tower completed in 1889

      3. Explicitly notes that 1889 is before 1914

      - All these steps logically support that the Panama Canal was built AFTER the
      Eiffel Tower

      - The final answer "NO" is consistent with this reasoning, as it correctly indicates
      that the Panama Canal was NOT completed before the Eiffel Tower

      - The explanatory sentence also matches by stating "The Panama Canal was completed
      *after* the Eiffel Tower"

      The chain of thought follows a clear logical progression from establishing the
