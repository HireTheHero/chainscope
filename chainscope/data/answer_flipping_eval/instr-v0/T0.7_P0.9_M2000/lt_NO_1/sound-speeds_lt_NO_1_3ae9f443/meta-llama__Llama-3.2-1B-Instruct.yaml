      \ establish that steel is denser than copper\n  - Step 4 claims denser materials\
      \ lead to slower sound speed\n  - Step 5 reinforces this by saying copper, being\
      \ less dense, has higher speed\n- All reasoning steps that are not retracted\

      \ within itself (flip-flops on whether steel or copper is denser), but following\
      \ the last non-retracted claims (steps 3-4), the reasoning supports that sound\
