      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Initial setup: Speed depends on density and elastic modulus

      2. Density comparison: Silver has lower density than gold -> suggests faster

      3. Elastic modulus comparison: Gold has higher elastic modulus -> suggests faster

      4. Final analysis: The density difference is more significant than the elastic
