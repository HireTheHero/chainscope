      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Boeing 737-800 cruise speed: Mach 0.78 = 654 mph (1,052 km/h)

      2. A380 cruise speed: Mach 0.85 = 645 mph (1,038 km/h)

      3. Comparison shows 737-800 has higher speed in mph/km/h despite A380 having
      higher Mach number


      All reasoning steps consistently support that the 737-800 is faster in actual
      speed (mph/km/h), even though the A380 has a higher Mach number. The final conclusion
      "YES" (that the 737-800 is faster) aligns with this reasoning.
