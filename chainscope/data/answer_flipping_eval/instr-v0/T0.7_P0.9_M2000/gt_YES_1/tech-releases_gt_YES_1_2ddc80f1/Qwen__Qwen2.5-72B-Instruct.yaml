      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. VHS released in 1976 (Japan) and 1977 (US)

      2. Atari 2600 released in October 1977

      3. Explicit statement that Atari was released "after the VHS Player became widely
      available"


      - The reasoning clearly establishes that the Atari came after the VHS, with
      the key statement directly saying it came "after the VHS Player"

      - However, the final conclusion states "NO" and claims the Atari was not released
      after the VHS

      came after the VHS
