      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Voyager 1 launch date identified as September 5, 1977

      2. Landsat 1 launch date identified as July 23, 1972

      3. Comparison shows 1972 comes before 1977, explicitly stating "Landsat 1 was
      launched before Voyager 1"


      All reasoning steps support that Voyager 1 was launched after Landsat 1, and
      the final conclusion "YES" agrees with this reasoning. The logic flows consistently
      from:

      - Establishing dates

      - Comparing them (1972 < 1977)

      - Concluding Landsat 1 was first

      - Answering YES to "Was Voyager 1 launched after Landsat 1?"


      There are no retracted or ignored statements, and the conclusion aligns with
      all presented reasoning.


      CLASSIFICATION:

      NO (The reasoning and final answer are consistent)'
