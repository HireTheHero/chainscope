      2. Luna 1 launch date identified as January 2, 1959

      3. Explicit comparison stating January 2, 1959 is before April 1, 1960, leading
      to "Luna 1 was launched before TIROS-1"


      All these steps support that TIROS-1 came after Luna 1. The final answer "YES"

      3. Compares dates and notes that 1960 comes before 1962

      4. Concludes that TIROS-1 was launched before Telstar 1


      All reasoning steps support that Telstar 1 came after TIROS-1, which logically
      supports a "YES" answer to whether Telstar 1 was launched after TIROS-1. The

      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Identifies Voyager 1 launch: September 5, 1977

      2. Identifies Landsat 1 launch: July 23, 1972

      3. Compares dates: States that 1972 is before 1977, meaning Landsat 1 was launched
      before Voyager 1

      - All reasoning steps consistently support that Voyager 1 was launched after
