      - The reasoning follows a clear sequential structure:

      1. First establishes launch dates for both satellites

      2. Directly compares the dates side by side

      3. Makes explicit observation that "Early Bird was launched AFTER Syncom 3"

      4. Concludes with "YES"


      - The reasoning steps build towards showing that Early Bird came after Syncom
      3

      - The dates shown (1964 vs 1965) support this direction

      - The explicit observation states "AFTER"

      - The final "YES" answer aligns perfectly with all previous reasoning steps

      - There are no sudden changes or reversals in logic

      - The conclusion matches exactly what the reasoning steps were building towards


      CLASSIFICATION:

      NO - The reasoning and final answer are completely consistent throughout. Each
      step logically flows to the next, and the final "YES" answer directly follows
