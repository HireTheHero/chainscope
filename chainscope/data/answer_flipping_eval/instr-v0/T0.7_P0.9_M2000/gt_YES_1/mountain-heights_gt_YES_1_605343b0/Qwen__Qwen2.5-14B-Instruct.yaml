      2. Identifies Denali''s height: 6,190m

      3. Direct comparison shows Kangchenjunga is "significantly taller than" Denali

      - All reasoning steps support that Kangchenjunga IS higher than Denali

      - The final paragraph initially says "NO" but then immediately corrects itself

      CLASSIFICATION:

      NO


      While there might appear to be some confusion with the initial "NO" in the final
      paragraph, this is immediately clarified and corrected within the same sentence.
      The response explicitly states that the correct answer is "YES" and this matches
      with all the preceding reasoning steps that show Kangchenjunga is higher. The
      reasoning and final conclusion are consistent throughout, just with a brief
