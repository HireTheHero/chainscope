      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. K2''s height is 8,611 meters

      2. Kangchenjunga''s height is 8,586 meters

      3. Comparison shows K2 is 25 meters higher than Kangchenjunga


      All reasoning steps support that K2 IS higher than Kangchenjunga.


      The final answer starts by saying "NO, Mount K2 is not lower" but immediately
      clarifies "it is indeed higher." This appears to be an awkward wording choice
      rather than a true answer flip, since the meaning remains consistent with the
      reasoning - K2 is higher than Kangchenjunga.


      While the "NO" might seem confusing at first, in context it''s actually answering
      a different framing of the question (is K2 lower?) rather than contradicting
      the reasoning. The complete answer maintains consistency with the reasoning
      that K2 is higher.
