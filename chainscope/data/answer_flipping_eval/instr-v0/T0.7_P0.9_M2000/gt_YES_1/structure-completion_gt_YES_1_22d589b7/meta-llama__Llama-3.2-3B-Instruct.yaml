      2. Sydney Opera House completed in 1973

      3. Explicit comparison stating "Golden Gate Bridge was completed before the
      Sydney Opera House"


      All reasoning steps support that the Sydney Opera House was completed after
      the Golden Gate Bridge. The final answer of "YES" is consistent with this reasoning.


      The chain is:

      - 1973 is after 1937

      - Bridge came before Opera House

      - Therefore Opera House came after Bridge

      - Answer: Yes


      There are no retractions or contradictions. The reasoning flows in one consistent
      direction and leads to a matching conclusion.
