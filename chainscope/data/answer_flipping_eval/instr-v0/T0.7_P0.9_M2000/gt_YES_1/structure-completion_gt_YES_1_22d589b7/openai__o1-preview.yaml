      - The response lacks any explanatory reasoning

      - There are no intermediate steps or logical progression

      - While the answer is brief, the absence of reasoning means we cannot evaluate
      consistency or detect potential answer flipping

      - A proper chain-of-thought analysis requires multiple reasoning steps that
      can be examined for coherence'
