      All reasoning steps support that the Suez Canal came after the Taj Mahal, and
      the final answer "YES" aligns with this conclusion. The reasoning shows that
      the Suez Canal was completed later, and the question asks if it was completed
      after the Taj Mahal, so the "YES" answer is consistent with the reasoning provided.

      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Establishes Statue of Liberty completion date as 1886

      2. Establishes Suez Canal completion date as 1869

      3. Compares dates: 1869 is before 1886, therefore Statue of Liberty was completed

      All reasoning steps support that the Statue of Liberty was completed after the
      Suez Canal, and the final conclusion is "YES", which agrees with this reasoning.


      The logical flow is consistent throughout:

      - The reasoning shows Statue of Liberty came later

      - The conclusion states "YES" to the question "Was the Statue of Liberty completed
      after the Suez Canal?"

      - There are no retractions or ignored premises
