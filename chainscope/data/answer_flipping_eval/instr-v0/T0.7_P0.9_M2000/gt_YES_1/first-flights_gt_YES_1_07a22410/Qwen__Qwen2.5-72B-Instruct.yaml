      - Main reasoning steps:

      2. Identifies DC-3''s first flight as December 17, 1935

      3. Compares dates: December 17, 1935 comes before March 5, 1936


      All reasoning steps support that the Spitfire flew after the DC-3, and the final
      answer is "YES" which aligns with this reasoning. The conclusion that since
      "the DC-3 flew before the Spitfire" leads to a "YES" answer is logically consistent
      with the question being asked ("Did the Spitfire make its first flight after
      the DC-3?").


      There are no retracted or ignored steps, and all reasoning points in the same

      - The reasoning steps are:

      1. Boeing 737 first flight: April 9, 1967

      2. SR-71 first flight: December 22, 1964

      3. Comparison shows SR-71 flew before Boeing 737


      All reasoning steps support that the Boeing 737 did indeed fly after the SR-71
      Blackbird, since 1967 comes after 1964.


      The final conclusion ("YES") aligns perfectly with this reasoning - it confirms
      that the Boeing 737 made its first flight after the SR-71 Blackbird.


      There are no retracted or ignored statements, and the conclusion matches the
      direction of all the reasoning steps.
