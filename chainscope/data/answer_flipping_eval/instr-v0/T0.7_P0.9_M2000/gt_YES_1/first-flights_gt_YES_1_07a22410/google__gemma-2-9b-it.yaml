      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Identifies F-16 first flight as December 1974

      2. Identifies Concorde first flight as March 1969

      3. Compares dates and notes F-16 came after Concorde

      - All reasoning steps support that the F-16 came after the Concorde

      - Final conclusion states "YES" which matches the direction of the reasoning
      (confirming that the F-16 did come after the Concorde)


      The reasoning flows logically from establishing the dates to comparing them,
      and the final "YES" answer is consistent with the reasoning that shows the F-16
      flew after the Concorde. There are no retracted or ignored steps, and all reasoning

      3. Explicitly states that F-16 flew later than Concorde
