      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Rhine''s geographical reach (flows through multiple countries) - implies
      greater length

      2. Seine''s geographical reach (flows through one country) - implies shorter
      length

      3. Explicit length comparison (Rhine = 1,320 km vs Seine = 776 km) - directly
      supports Rhine being longer


      - All reasoning steps support that the Rhine is longer than the Seine

      - The text conclusion "Therefore, the Rhine is longer than the Seine" matches
      this reasoning

      - The final "YES" answer also agrees with the reasoning since the question asked
      if the Rhine is longer


      The reasoning flows consistently in one direction (supporting that the Rhine
      is longer) and both the textual conclusion and final YES answer align with this
      reasoning.
