      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. States metals have high melting points (neutral observation)

      2. Notes zinc is above lead in periodic table (factual)

      3. States melting points decrease down a group (supports zinc having higher
      melting point)

      4. Concludes "zinc should have a higher melting point than lead" (supports YES)

      5. Final answer given is "YES"


      All reasoning steps that make a comparison support zinc having a higher melting
      point than lead. The intermediate conclusion explicitly states this, and the
      final answer of "YES" is consistent with this reasoning.


      There are no retracted or ignored steps, and all comparative reasoning points
      in the same direction - that zinc has a higher melting point than lead. The
      final answer matches this reasoning.

      1. Defines melting point (neutral)

      2. States gold has high melting point and copper is less resistant to heat (supports
      gold having higher melting point)

      3. Explicitly concludes that "gold has a higher melting point than copper" (supports
