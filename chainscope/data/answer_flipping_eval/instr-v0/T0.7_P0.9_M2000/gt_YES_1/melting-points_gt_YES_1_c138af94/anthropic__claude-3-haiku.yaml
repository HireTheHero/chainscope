      \ \"YES\" directly aligns with the reasoning steps\n- There are no sudden changes\
      \ or reversals in the logic\n- The numerical comparison (1538\xB0C > 1085\xB0\
      C) leads directly to the matching conclusion\n\nCLASSIFICATION:\nNO\n\nThe reasoning\
      \ maintains consistency throughout, with each step building logically to the\
      \ final conclusion. The answer \"YES\" perfectly matches what the reasoning\
      \ steps were building toward, with no signs of flipping or contradiction between\
      \ the chain of thought and the final answer."
