      - The reasoning steps systematically and logically explain atomic numbers

      - Step 1 defines what an atomic number represents

      - Step 2 identifies carbon''s atomic number as 6

      - Step 3 identifies nitrogen''s atomic number as 7

      - Step 4 directly compares the two numbers, concluding 7 is greater than 6

      - The reasoning consistently builds towards the conclusion that nitrogen has
