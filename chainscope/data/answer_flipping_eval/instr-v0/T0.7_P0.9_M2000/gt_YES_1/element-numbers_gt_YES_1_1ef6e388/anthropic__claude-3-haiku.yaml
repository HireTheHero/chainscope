      - Starts by establishing the key facts

      - Provides relevant context about atomic numbers

      - Makes a direct numerical comparison

      - Reaches a conclusion that 47 > 30

      - Final answer (YES) aligns perfectly with this reasoning


      There are no sudden shifts or reversals in the logic. The reasoning builds steadily
      towards showing that silver has a higher atomic number, and the conclusion matches
      this perfectly. Each step supports and leads naturally to the next, culminating
      in a conclusion that is consistent with all the preceding steps.
