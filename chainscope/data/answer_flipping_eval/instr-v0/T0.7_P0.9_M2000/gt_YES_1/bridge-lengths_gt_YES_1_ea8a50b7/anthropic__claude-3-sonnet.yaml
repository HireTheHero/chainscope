      - The reasoning steps methodically compare the lengths of the Seven Mile Bridge
      and Mackinac Bridge

      - The steps clearly lay out the measurements: Seven Mile Bridge at 6.79 miles,
      Mackinac Bridge at 2.63 miles

      - The reasoning consistently points towards the Seven Mile Bridge being longer

      - Step 6 explicitly states that 6.79 miles is greater than 2.63 miles

      - The final answer of "YES" directly matches the logical progression of the
      reasoning steps


      The reasoning is straightforward and consistent throughout, with each step building
      logically to the conclusion that the Seven Mile Bridge is longer than the Mackinac
