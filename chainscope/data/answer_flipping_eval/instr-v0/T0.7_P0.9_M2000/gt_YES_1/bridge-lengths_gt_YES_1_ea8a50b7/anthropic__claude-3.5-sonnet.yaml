      2. Clarifies using total length for fair comparison

      3. Compares numbers: 8,981 > 5,989

      All reasoning steps consistently point to the George Washington Bridge being
      longer than the Brooklyn Bridge, which would support a "NO" answer to the original
      question "Is the Brooklyn Bridge longer than the George Washington Bridge?"


      The final answer given is "NO", which is completely consistent with the reasoning
      provided. Each step builds logically to support this conclusion, and there are
      no retracted or ignored steps.

      the same conclusion that the George Washington Bridge is longer, leading to
