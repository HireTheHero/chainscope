      - The reasoning steps systematically go through the location and details of
      both bridges

      - Steps 3 and 4 provide specific length measurements for each bridge

      - Step 5 explicitly compares the lengths, clearly stating that the Sunshine
      Skyway Bridge is "significantly longer"
