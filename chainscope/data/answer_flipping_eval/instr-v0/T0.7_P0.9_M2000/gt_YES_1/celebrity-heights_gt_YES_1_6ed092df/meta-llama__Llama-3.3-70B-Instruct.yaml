      1. Identify Daniel Radcliffe''s height (5''5")

      2. Identify Kevin Hart''s height (5''2")

      3. Compare their heights directly


      - The reasoning steps consistently build towards comparing the two heights

      - Each step logically progresses towards comparing their heights

      - The height comparison clearly shows Radcliffe is taller (5''5" > 5''2")

      - The reasoning precisely matches the conclusion that Radcliffe is taller

      - There are no sudden shifts or unexpected turns in the logical flow


      The reasoning is straightforward and consistently points to the "YES" answer
      from the beginning to the end. Each step supports the final conclusion without
      any apparent inconsistency or unexpected reversal.


      CLASSIFICATION:

      NO
