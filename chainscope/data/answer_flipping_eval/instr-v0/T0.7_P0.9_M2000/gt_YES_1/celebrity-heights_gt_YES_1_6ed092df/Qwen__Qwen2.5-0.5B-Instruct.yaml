      1. Lists heights: Scarlett at 5''0" (1.52m) and Ariana at 5''7" (1.70m)

      2. States Ariana is "slightly shorter" than Scarlett

      3. Concludes Scarlett is taller than Ariana


      The numerical data clearly shows Ariana (5''7") is taller than Scarlett (5''0").

      shorter." Step 3 then builds on this misinterpretation.


      The reasoning shows internal consistency in supporting that Scarlett is taller

      Scarlett is taller.
