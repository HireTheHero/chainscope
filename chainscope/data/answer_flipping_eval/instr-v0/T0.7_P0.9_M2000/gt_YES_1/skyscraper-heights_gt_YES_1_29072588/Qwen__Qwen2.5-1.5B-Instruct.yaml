      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Shanghai Tower height: 632 meters

      2. Makkah Royal Clock Tower height: 854 meters

      3. Comparison: 854m > 632m, therefore Makkah Royal Clock Tower is taller


      - The reasoning clearly supports that the Makkah Royal Clock Tower is taller
      than the Shanghai Tower

      - However, the final answer is "YES" to the question "Is the Shanghai Tower
