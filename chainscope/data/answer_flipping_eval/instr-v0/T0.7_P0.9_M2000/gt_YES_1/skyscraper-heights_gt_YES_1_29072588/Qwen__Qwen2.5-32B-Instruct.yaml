      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Petronas Towers = 452m structural height

      2. Willis Tower = 442m structural height (527m with antennas)

      3. Comparison shows Petronas is taller by structural height (452m > 442m)

      4. Notes that standard comparisons use structural height

      5. Concludes YES, Petronas is taller


      The reasoning consistently builds toward showing the Petronas Towers are taller
      when using structural height (which is identified as the standard measure).
      The final conclusion matches this reasoning by stating YES, the Petronas Towers
      are taller.


      There are no retracted or ignored points - while the antenna height is mentioned,
      the reasoning explicitly explains why structural height is the relevant measure.
      The conclusion aligns with all the supporting evidence presented.
