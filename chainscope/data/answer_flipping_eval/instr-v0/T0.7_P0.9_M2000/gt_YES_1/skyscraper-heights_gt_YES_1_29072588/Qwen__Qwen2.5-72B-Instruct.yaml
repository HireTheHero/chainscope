      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. States 30 Hudson Yards height: 1,296 ft (roof), 1,271 ft (tip)

      2. States Empire State Building height: 1,250 ft (roof), 1,454 ft (total)

      3. Compares roof heights: 30 Hudson Yards is taller (1,296 > 1,250)

      4. Compares total heights: Empire State Building is taller (1,454 > 1,271)

      5. Makes explicit decision to use total height as the most accurate comparison


      The reasoning is consistent throughout:

      - It presents both roof and total heights

      - Acknowledges 30 Hudson Yards is taller by roof height

      - Explicitly chooses total height as the deciding metric

      - Concludes "NO" based on total height comparison (1,271 < 1,454)


      The final answer of "NO" aligns with the chosen comparison metric (total height).
      While the building is taller in one measure (roof height), the reasoning explicitly
      justifies why total height should be used, making the conclusion consistent
      with this chosen criterion.
