      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. States One World Trade Center height: 1,776 feet (541 meters)

      2. Provides context about Taipei 101''s historical significance

      3. States Taipei 101 height: 1,671 feet (509 meters)

      4. Makes direct numerical comparison showing One WTC is taller


      - The reasoning builds consistently toward showing One WTC is taller

      - The intermediate comparison step explicitly shows One WTC has greater height

      - The final conclusion matches the direction of the reasoning, stating "YES"
      and confirming One WTC is taller

      - There are no sudden changes or reversals in the logical flow


      The reasoning follows a clear progression:

      - Establishes both heights

      - Makes direct comparison

      - Reaches conclusion consistent with the numerical evidence

      - Both the reasoning steps and final answer point to the same conclusion
