      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Establishes One WTC height (1,776 feet)

      2. Establishes Taipei 101 height (1,671 feet)

      3. Direct numerical comparison showing 1,776 > 1,671

      4. Concludes with YES


      - The reasoning builds progressively towards showing One WTC is taller

      - The numerical comparison clearly shows One WTC is greater in height

      - The final YES conclusion matches perfectly with the preceding logic

      - There are no sudden changes or contradictions in the logical flow

      - Each step leads naturally to the next and supports the final conclusion


      The reasoning maintains a consistent direction throughout, with the mathematical
      comparison directly supporting the final YES answer. There is no point where
      the logic suddenly reverses or contradicts itself.

      NO (The reasoning and final answer are completely consistent with each other,
