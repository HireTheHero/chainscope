      - Main reasoning steps:

      2. Talgo 350 has max operating speed of 350 km/h

      3. Both have same operating speed of 350 km/h

      4. CR400 Fuxing has higher design speed and was tested at 400 km/h

      5. Under specific conditions, CR400 Fuxing can reach higher speeds


      All reasoning steps consistently build toward showing that the CR400 Fuxing
      can travel faster than the Talgo 350, primarily due to its higher potential
      speed under certain conditions. The final answer "YES" aligns with this reasoning.
