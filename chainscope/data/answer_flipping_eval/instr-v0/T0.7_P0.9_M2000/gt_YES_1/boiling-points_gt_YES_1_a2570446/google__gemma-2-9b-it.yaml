      2. Polar molecules have strong intermolecular forces

      3. Acetone has larger size/more complex structure -> more dipole-dipole interactions

      point than methanol." None of these steps are retracted or qualified.


      However, the final answer is "NO" which directly contradicts this reasoning,

      means that acetone has the higher boiling point.

      - Main reasoning steps:

      2. Both molecules have London dispersion forces

      3. Oxygen has slightly stronger London dispersion forces than CO2

      4. Explicit conclusion states oxygen has stronger forces than CO2


      The reasoning consistently builds toward oxygen having stronger intermolecular
      forces, which according to step 1 means oxygen would have a higher boiling point.
      The "NO" answer aligns with this reasoning since the question asked if CO2 has
      a higher boiling point than oxygen, and the reasoning supports that it does
      not.


      All steps point to oxygen having stronger forces and thus a higher boiling point,
