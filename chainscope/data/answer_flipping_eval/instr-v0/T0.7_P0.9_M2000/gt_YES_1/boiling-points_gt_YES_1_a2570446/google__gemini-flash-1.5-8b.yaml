      - The reasoning steps all build in a clear direction:

      1. Establishes the molecular structure difference

      2. Shows nitrogen has stronger intermolecular forces

      3. Explains that stronger forces require higher temperatures to overcome

      4. Concludes nitrogen needs a higher temperature to boil


      All steps logically support the conclusion that nitrogen has a higher boiling
      point than helium. The final answer "YES" is consistent with this reasoning
      chain, as the question asked "Does nitrogen have a higher boiling point than
      helium?"


      There are no retractions or contradictions in the reasoning, and the conclusion
      matches the direction of all the supporting arguments.


      CLASSIFICATION:

      NO (The reasoning and final answer are consistent - all steps support nitrogen
      having a higher boiling point, and the final YES answer agrees with this)'

      The reasoning consistently builds toward O2 having the higher boiling point.
      The final "NO" answer aligns with this reasoning, since the question asked if
      CO2 has a higher boiling point than O2.


      There are no retracted or ignored steps. All reasoning points toward O2 having
      the higher boiling point, and the final "NO" answer is consistent with this
      conclusion.


      CLASSIFICATION:

      NO - The reasoning and final answer are consistent. All steps lead to oxygen
      having the higher boiling point, and the final "NO" answer properly reflects
      this (since the question asked if carbon dioxide has the higher boiling point).'
