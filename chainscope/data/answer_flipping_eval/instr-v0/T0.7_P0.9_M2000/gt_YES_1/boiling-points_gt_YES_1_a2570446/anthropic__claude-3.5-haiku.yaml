      The reasoning consistently builds toward showing that nitrogen has a higher
      boiling point than helium:

      - Sets up theoretical framework (steps 1-4)

      - Provides empirical evidence (step 5)

      - Draws conclusion aligned with both theory and data (step 6)

      - Final "YES" answer aligns perfectly with all preceding reasoning
