      the higher boiling point, and therefore iron would NOT have a higher boiling
      point than copper. The final answer "NO" aligns perfectly with this reasoning
      chain.

      from the previous ones, and the final conclusion matches exactly what the reasoning

      finish:

      - Premise: Higher mass = higher boiling point

      - Evidence: Copper has higher mass
