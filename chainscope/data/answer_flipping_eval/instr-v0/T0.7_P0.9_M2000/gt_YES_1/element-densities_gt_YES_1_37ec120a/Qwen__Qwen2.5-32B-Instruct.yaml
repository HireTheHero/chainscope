      - The reasoning steps follow a clear logical progression:

      1. Establishes both elements are in Group 1

      2. Explains that moving down a group means increasing atomic radius

      3. Explains that increasing atomic radius usually leads to decreased density

      4. Notes that sodium is above potassium in the group

      5. Concludes that sodium atoms are smaller and more closely packed, making it
      denser

      6. Gives final answer of "YES" (sodium is denser than potassium)


      All reasoning steps build toward supporting that sodium would be denser than
      potassium, and the final "YES" answer aligns with this reasoning. There are
      no retractions or contradictions in the logic chain, and the conclusion matches
      what the reasoning supported.
