      - The reasoning follows these clear steps:

      1. Establishes that density comparison requires mass per unit volume

      2. States the density values for both metals

      3. Directly compares the values (8.96 > 7.87)

      4. Explicitly states that copper is denser based on this comparison

      5. Concludes with "YES"
