      3. Explicitly states we should use maximum depth for comparison

      4. Concludes Bering Sea is deeper based on maximum depth


      The reasoning clearly shows two different metrics (average and maximum depth)

      factor. The final answer (YES) aligns perfectly with this chosen metric and
      the reasoning that supports it.

      The answer given follows this reasoning by concluding "NO" based on average
