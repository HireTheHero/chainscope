      sound being faster in steel

      - The reasoning steps follow this logic:

      1. Establishes that speed of sound depends on density and Young''s modulus

      2. Compares density: Lead is denser than rubber -> suggests slower speed in
      lead

      3. Compares Young''s modulus: Lead has higher modulus than rubber -> suggests
      faster speed in lead

      4. Concludes that Young''s modulus effect is more significant than density effect
      -> supports that sound travels FASTER in lead

      5. Therefore sound travels SLOWER in rubber than in lead


      - All non-retracted reasoning ultimately supports that sound travels SLOWER
