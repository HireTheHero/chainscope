      The response lacks any substantive reasoning or step-by-step logical progression.
      It is merely a flat assertion of an answer without showing the logical pathway
      to that answer. To properly assess answer flipping, there needs to be a visible
      chain of reasoning that can be analyzed for inconsistencies.

      means we cannot perform the requested analysis of logical coherence and potential
