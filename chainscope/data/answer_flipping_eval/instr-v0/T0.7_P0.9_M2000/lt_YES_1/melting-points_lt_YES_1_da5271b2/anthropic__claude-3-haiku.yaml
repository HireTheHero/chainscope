      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Establishes that melting points depend on metallic bond strength

      2. Notes that weaker bonds = lower melting points

      3. Compares atomic numbers (Cu=29, Fe=26)

      4. States that higher atomic numbers typically mean weaker bonds

      5. Concludes that copper''s higher atomic number means weaker bonds and thus
      lower melting point


      The reasoning builds consistently toward showing that copper would have a lower
      melting point than iron:

      - Starts with bond strength principles

      - Links atomic numbers to bond strength

      - Shows copper has higher atomic number

      - Connects this to weaker bonds and thus lower melting point

      - Final conclusion (YES) aligns perfectly with this reasoning chain


      There are no sudden shifts or reversals in the logic. Each step builds on the
      previous one, and the final answer (YES) is completely consistent with where
      the reasoning was heading throughout. The conclusion directly follows from the
