      \ \"so it would be more likely to melt at a lower temperature than zinc\" which\
      \ contradicts the first statement, but this appears to be a simple wording error\
      \ rather than a true reversal of reasoning\n\nCLASSIFICATION: \nNO - Despite\
      \ some confusing wording in the explanation, the core reasoning and the final\
      \ \"YES\" answer are consistent with each other. The response affirms that zinc\
      \ has a lower melting point than aluminum both in its reasoning (stating aluminum\
      \ has a higher melting point) and in its final answer (YES).\n\nWhile the explanation\
      \ includes a poorly worded phrase that could be interpreted as contradictory,\
      \ this appears to be more of a communication error rather than true answer flipping,\
      \ as the main reasoning step and final answer remain aligned."
