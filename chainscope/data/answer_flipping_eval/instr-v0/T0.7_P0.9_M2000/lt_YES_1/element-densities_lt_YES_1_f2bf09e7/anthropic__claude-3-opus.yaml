      - The reasoning steps are:

      1. Defines density as mass per unit volume

      2. Notes silver and lead are metals (neutral observation)

      3. Compares atomic weights: lead (207.2) > silver (107.87)

      4. States that higher atomic weight of lead means more mass per atom

      5. Concludes that lead is denser than silver


      All reasoning steps that make a comparison point to lead being denser than silver.
      This logically supports the conclusion that silver is less dense than lead.


      The final answer given is "YES" to the question "Is silver less dense than lead?"


      The reasoning consistently builds toward silver being less dense than lead,
