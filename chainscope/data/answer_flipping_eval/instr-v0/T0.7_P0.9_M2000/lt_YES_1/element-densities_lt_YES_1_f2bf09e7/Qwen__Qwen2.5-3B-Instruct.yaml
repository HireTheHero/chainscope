      - The reasoning steps are clearly laid out and build towards a specific conclusion:

      1. Compares atomic properties

      2. Notes lithium has smaller atomic radius

      3. Discusses electronegativity (though not directly relevant to conclusion)

      4. Explains density calculation

      5. Compares specific atomic radii values

      6. States that smaller atomic radius leads to tighter packing


      - The final reasoning step explicitly states "lithium atoms are likely to pack
      more tightly together" and concludes this would result in "higher density for
      lithium"

      - This conclusion is consistent throughout and directly supported by the previous
      reasoning

      - The final "NO" answer aligns with the conclusion that lithium has higher density
