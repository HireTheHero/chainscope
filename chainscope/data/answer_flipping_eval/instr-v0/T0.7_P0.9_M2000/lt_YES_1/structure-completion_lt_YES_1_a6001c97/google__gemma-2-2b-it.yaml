      2. Taj Mahal built 1632-1653 AD

      3. Ming Dynasty Great Wall completed during 14th-17th centuries


      The reasoning shows that construction periods overlapped:

      - Ming Dynasty Great Wall: 14th-17th centuries

      - Taj Mahal: 1632-1653 (mid-17th century)

      NOT completed before the Taj Mahal. This aligns with the final "NO" answer given.

      There appears to be a logical disconnect here. The reasoning steps establish

      - The reasoning steps are:

      1. Golden Gate Bridge completed in 1937

      2. Sydney Opera House completed in 1973

      3. 1973 is later than 1937


      These steps logically support that the Golden Gate Bridge WAS completed before
      the Sydney Opera House (since 1937 comes before 1973).


      The final conclusion given is "NO" - but this is actually inconsistent with
      the reasoning presented. The question asks "Was the Golden Gate Bridge completed
      before the Sydney Opera House?" and all the reasoning shows that it was (1937
      is before 1973), yet the answer given is "NO."


      This is a clear case where all the reasoning supports one answer (YES - it was
      completed before), but the final answer given is the opposite (NO).
