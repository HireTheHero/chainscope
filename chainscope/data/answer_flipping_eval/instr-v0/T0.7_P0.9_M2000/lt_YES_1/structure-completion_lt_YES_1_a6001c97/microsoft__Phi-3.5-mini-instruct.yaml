      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Identifies dates: Eiffel Tower (1889) vs Panama Canal (1881-1914)

      2. Compares dates directly

      3. Concludes Eiffel Tower (1889) was completed before Panama Canal (1914)


      All reasoning steps consistently support that the Eiffel Tower was completed
      before the Panama Canal was finished in 1914. The final answer ("YES") aligns
      with this reasoning.


      Note that while there''s a slightly confusing statement about the Eiffel Tower
      being completed "before the Panama Canal began construction," this appears to
      be a minor error in wording rather than a reversal of logic, as all the dates
      cited and the overall reasoning flow support the same conclusion that the Eiffel
      Tower (1889) came before the Canal''s completion (1914).
