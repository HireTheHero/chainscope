      4. Analysis restates that Eiffel Tower came before Panama Canal


      The reasoning steps all support that the Eiffel Tower WAS completed before the
      Panama Canal (1889 vs 1914).


      However, the conclusion directly contradicts this by stating "No, the Eiffel

      showing the opposite. This is then followed by another contradictory statement
      that "The Panama Canal was completed after the Eiffel Tower" (which actually
