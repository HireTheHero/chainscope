      - Main reasoning steps:

      2. States Empire State Building completion date (1931)

      3. Directly compares the dates (1914 comes before 1931)


      The reasoning flows in a clear direction:

      - Establishes two dates

      - Compares them chronologically

      - Concludes that 1914 precedes 1931


      The final answer (YES) aligns perfectly with the reasoning steps. There are
      no sudden changes or shifts in logic. The conclusion that the Panama Canal was
      completed before the Empire State Building follows directly from the comparison
      of dates established in the reasoning steps.


      There''s complete consistency between:

      - The chronological comparison in the reasoning

      - The intermediate conclusion in step 3

      - The final YES answer
