      - The reasoning steps are:

      2. Identifies Caribbean Sea location (neutral fact)

      3. States "Caribbean Sea has a generally deeper average depth than the Sargasso
      Sea" (this is the key comparative fact)


      The key comparative fact states that the Caribbean is DEEPER than the Sargasso
      Sea. This means the Sargasso Sea is NOT deeper than the Caribbean Sea, which
      aligns with answering NO to whether the Sargasso Sea is shallower.


      The final conclusion "NO" is consistent with the reasoning that shows the Caribbean
      Sea is deeper than the Sargasso Sea. The reasoning and answer both support the
