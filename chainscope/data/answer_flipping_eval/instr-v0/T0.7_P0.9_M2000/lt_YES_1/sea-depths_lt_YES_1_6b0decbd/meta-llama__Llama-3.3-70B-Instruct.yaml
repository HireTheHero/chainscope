      3. Comparison: Notes Caribbean has deeper maximum depth than Sargasso

      4. Acknowledges complexity but doesn''t retract earlier points


      The reasoning presents data showing the Sargasso Sea has a greater average depth

      \ focuses on \"general comparison\"\n5. States Sargasso \"is not necessarily\
      \ shallower\" than Caribbean\n\nThe reasoning shows that while both seas have\
      \ varying depths, the Caribbean has deeper extremes (7,000+ m) compared to Sargasso\
      \ (4,000-6,000 m). The text never presents evidence that the Sargasso Sea is\
      \ deeper or equal to the Caribbean - all comparative statements highlight the\
      \ Caribbean's deeper regions.\n\nHowever, the conclusion states \"NO\" to whether\
      \ the Sargasso is shallower than the Caribbean, which contradicts the evidence\

      \ would support this conclusion.\n\nCLASSIFICATION:\nYES (Clear signs of answer\
