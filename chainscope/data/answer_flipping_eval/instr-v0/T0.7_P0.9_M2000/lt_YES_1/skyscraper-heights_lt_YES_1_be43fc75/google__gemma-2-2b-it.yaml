      1. Sets up comparison framework

      2. States Taipei 101 is "not as tall as" One World Trade Center

      to step 3 of their framework, they stated "If Taipei 101 is shorter than the
      One World Trade Center, we''ll answer ''NO''"

      - Their own framework combined with their reasoning about relative heights should
      have led to a "YES" answer based on their setup
