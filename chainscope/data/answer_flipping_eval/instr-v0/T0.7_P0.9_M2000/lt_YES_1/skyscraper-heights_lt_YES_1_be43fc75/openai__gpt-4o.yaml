      2. Empire State Building height without antenna: 1,250 feet

      3. 30 Hudson Yards height: 1,268 feet

      4. Comparison made both with and without antenna

      5. Key conclusion stated: "Since the Empire State Building''s full height includes
      the antenna, it is taller than 30 Hudson Yards"


      The reasoning consistently builds toward showing that the Empire State Building
      (with antenna) is TALLER than 30 Hudson Yards (1,454 ft > 1,268 ft). This directly
      supports answering "NO" to whether the Empire State Building is shorter.


      The final answer given is "NO", which aligns perfectly with the reasoning presented.
      There are no retracted or ignored points, and all steps lead logically to the
