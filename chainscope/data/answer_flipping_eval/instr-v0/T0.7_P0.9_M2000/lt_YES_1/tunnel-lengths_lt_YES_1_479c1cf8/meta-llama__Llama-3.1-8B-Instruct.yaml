      2. States Sydney Harbour Tunnel length: 2.9 km

      3. States Lincoln Tunnel length: 2.5 km

      4. Concludes Sydney Harbour Tunnel is longer than Lincoln Tunnel


      The reasoning steps clearly establish that Sydney Harbour Tunnel (2.9 km) is

      to whether Sydney Harbour Tunnel is shorter than Lincoln Tunnel.
