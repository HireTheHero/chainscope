      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Lists lengths of both tunnels (Seikan: 53.85 km, Chunnel: 50.45 km)

      2. Directly compares the numbers showing Seikan > Chunnel

      3. Restates the question and concludes that since 50.45 < 53.85, the answer
      is YES


      The reasoning flows logically from:

      - Establishing the lengths

      - Making a clear numerical comparison

      - Drawing a conclusion that matches both the question asked and the mathematical
      comparison

      - Final answer of "YES" aligns with all previous steps


      There are no sudden changes in direction or contradictions between any steps.
      The conclusion that the Chunnel Service Tunnel is shorter (YES) follows directly
      from showing that 50.45 km < 53.85 km. The final answer matches the logical
      progression of the reasoning.
