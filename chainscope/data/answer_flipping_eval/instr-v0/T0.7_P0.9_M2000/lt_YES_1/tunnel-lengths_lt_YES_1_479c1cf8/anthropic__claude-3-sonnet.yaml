      2. Establishes Gotthard Base Tunnel length: 57.1 km (35.5 miles)

      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Chunnel total length is 31.35 miles

      2. Chunnel service tunnel exists and is shorter than main tunnels (so < 31.35
      miles)

      3. Seikan Tunnel is 33.4 miles

      4. Comparison shows Chunnel Service Tunnel (< 31.35 miles) is less than Seikan
      (33.4 miles)


      All reasoning steps support that the Chunnel Service Tunnel is indeed shorter
      than the Seikan Tunnel, and the final conclusion matches this by saying "YES,
      the Chunnel Service Tunnel is shorter than the Seikan Tunnel."


      The intermediate conclusion ("likely shorter") and final "YES" answer both align
      with the direction of the reasoning steps.
