      3. Determine Rhine''s length (1,233 km)

      4. Compare river lengths


      - The reasoning steps progressively build towards comparing the river lengths,

      - Each step logically supports the conclusion that the Seine is shorter than
      the Rhine

      - The reasoning consistently points towards the "YES" answer from Step 4 onward

      - There are no signs of answer flipping

      - The reasoning is linear and consistent
