      bonding)

      3. States stronger forces = higher boiling point

      4. Concludes methanol will have higher boiling point than acetone


      All reasoning steps consistently support that methanol has a higher boiling
      point than acetone, which means acetone has a lower boiling point than methanol.


      However, the final answer given is "NO" and explicitly states "Acetone does
