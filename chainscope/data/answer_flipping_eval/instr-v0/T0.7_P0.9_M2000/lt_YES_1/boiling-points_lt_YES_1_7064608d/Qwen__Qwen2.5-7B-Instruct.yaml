      - The reasoning steps all point toward ethanol having a higher boiling point

      1. Ethanol has additional atoms (larger molecule)

      2. Ethanol can form more extensive hydrogen bonding networks

      forces

      4. The summary states "additional structural features in ethanol contribute
      to stronger intermolecular forces overall"

      2. Defines boiling point

      3. Notes CO2 has weak van der Waals forces while acetone has stronger hydrogen
      bonds

      4. Explains hydrogen bonds are stronger than van der Waals forces

      6. Concludes acetone has higher boiling point due to stronger forces


      All reasoning steps consistently support that acetone has a higher boiling point

      The final conclusion states "NO", but then immediately contradicts itself by
