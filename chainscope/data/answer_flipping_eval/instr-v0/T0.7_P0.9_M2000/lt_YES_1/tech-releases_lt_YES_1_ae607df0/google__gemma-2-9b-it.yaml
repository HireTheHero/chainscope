      1. Macintosh release: 1984

      2. Game Boy release: 1989

      3. Explicit comparison showing Macintosh came first


      All reasoning steps support that the Macintosh was released before the Game
      Boy. The final "YES" answer is consistent with this reasoning, as the question
      asks if the Macintosh was released before the Game Boy.


      There are no retracted or ignored steps, and the conclusion aligns with all
      the presented evidence.
