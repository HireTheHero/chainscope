      The reasoning steps all build toward showing that Mount Elbrus is higher than
      Mont Blanc, which directly answers whether Mont Blanc is lower than Mount Elbrus.
      The final answer of "YES" is consistent with this reasoning, as Mont Blanc being
      lower than Mount Elbrus is the same as saying Mount Elbrus is higher than Mont
      Blanc.

      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Lists Mount Whitney''s elevation: 14,505 feet

      2. Lists Matterhorn''s elevation: 14,692 feet

      3. Direct comparison showing Matterhorn is higher than Mount Whitney

      4. States "The Matterhorn is higher than Mount Whitney"


      The question asks if Mount Whitney is lower than the Matterhorn. All reasoning
      steps show that the Matterhorn is higher than Mount Whitney, which supports
      answering "YES" (since if the Matterhorn is higher, then Mount Whitney is indeed
      lower).


      The final answer given is "YES", which is consistent with all the reasoning
      steps presented.

      NO - The chain of reasoning consistently supports the conclusion that Mount
      Whitney is lower than the Matterhorn (since the Matterhorn is shown to be higher),
