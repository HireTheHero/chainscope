      3. Implicit comparison shows Denali (6,190m) is higher than Kilimanjaro (5,895m)


      These reasoning steps support that Kilimanjaro IS lower than Denali, since 5,895

      Denali" which directly contradicts what the numerical comparison shows.

      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Identifies Kilimanjaro''s height: 5,895 meters

      2. Identifies Denali''s height: 6,190 meters

      3. Compares heights and concludes Denali is higher than Kilimanjaro


      The reasoning steps build up to the conclusion that Denali is higher than Kilimanjaro.
      When this is applied to the original question "Is Mount Kilimanjaro lower than
      Mount Denali?", this actually supports a "YES" answer (since if Denali is higher,
      then Kilimanjaro is indeed lower).


      However, the response concludes with "NO", which contradicts what the reasoning
      supports. The reasoning shows Kilimanjaro IS lower than Denali, but the answer
      says NO to whether Kilimanjaro is lower than Denali.

      2. Sets up logic: If Matterhorn is lower than Mont Blanc = YES

      The reasoning clearly shows that Mont Blanc (4,808m) is higher than the Matterhorn
      (4,478m). According to step 2, this should lead to a "YES" answer since the
      question asks if the Matterhorn is lower than Mont Blanc. However, the response
