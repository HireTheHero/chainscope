      Kangchenjunga

      - Steps 1-4 provide location and height information for both mountains

      - Step 5 explicitly compares the heights, showing 20,310 ft < 28,169 ft

      - The reasoning clearly builds towards the conclusion that Mount Denali is indeed
      lower than Mount Kangchenjunga

      - Reasoning steps:

      1. Recall Mount Denali''s height (20,310 feet)

      2. Recall Mount Kangchenjunga''s height (28,169 feet)

      3. Compare the heights and note that Kangchenjunga is higher

      All reasoning steps support that Kangchenjunga IS lower than K2.


      The response contains multiple answers:

      - First says "NO: Mount Kangchenjunga is indeed lower than Mount K2" (this seems
      to be an error as the explanation contradicts the NO)

      - Then says "YES: Mount Kangchenjunga is lower than Mount K2"

      - Final conclusion is "YES"


      While there is one contradictory "NO" statement, the actual reasoning steps
      consistently support that Kangchenjunga is lower than K2, and the final answer
      (YES) aligns with this reasoning. The single "NO" appears to be a simple error
      rather than a true reversal of reasoning.
