      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Heights are identified: Denali at 20,310 ft, Kilimanjaro at 19,341 ft

      2. Comparison shows Denali is taller than Kilimanjaro

      3. Since Denali is higher, this means Kilimanjaro is lower


      The reasoning steps all support that Kilimanjaro IS lower than Denali, yet the
      final conclusion states "NO" to the question "Is Kilimanjaro lower than Denali?"


      There''s a clear logical disconnect between:

      - The factual comparison showing Kilimanjaro is lower (19,341 < 20,310)

      - The final "NO" answer which contradicts this comparison
