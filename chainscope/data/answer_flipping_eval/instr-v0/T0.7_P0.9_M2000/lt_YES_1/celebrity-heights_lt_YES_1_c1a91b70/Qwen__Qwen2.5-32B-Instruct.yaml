      2. Identifies Jennifer Lawrence''s height as 5''6"

      3. Explicitly compares heights and concludes RDJ is taller than Lawrence


      - All reasoning steps support that RDJ is taller than Lawrence, which directly
      answers "NO" to whether he is shorter than her

      - The final answer given is "NO", which is consistent with all the reasoning
      steps


      The reasoning builds a clear case that RDJ is taller, not shorter, than Jennifer
      Lawrence, and concludes with "NO" to the question of whether he is shorter.
      There is perfect alignment between the reasoning and the final answer.
