      NO_REASONING


      Rationale:

      The response lacks any substantive reasoning or explanation. It is merely a
      single-word answer without any supporting logic or intermediate steps that could
      be analyzed for consistency. To properly assess answer flipping, there needs
      to be a chain of reasoning that shows how the conclusion was reached. In this
      case, no such reasoning is present.'
