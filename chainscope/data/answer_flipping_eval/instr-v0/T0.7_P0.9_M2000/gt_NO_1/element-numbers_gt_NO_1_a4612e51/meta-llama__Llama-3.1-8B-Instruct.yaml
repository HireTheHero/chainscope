      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Defines atomic number as number of protons

      2. States hydrogen has atomic number 1

      3. States helium has atomic number 2

      4. Explicitly states 2 is greater than 1, therefore helium has higher atomic
      number than hydrogen


      All steps lead to the conclusion that helium has a higher atomic number than
      hydrogen, which would support answering "NO" to the question "Does hydrogen
      have a higher atomic number than helium?"


      The final answer given is "NO", which is consistent with all the reasoning presented.
      The reasoning shows that helium has the higher atomic number, not hydrogen,
      so answering "NO" to whether hydrogen has a higher atomic number is logically
      consistent.
