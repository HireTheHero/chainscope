      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Iron has atomic number 26

      2. Copper has atomic number 29

      3. 29 is greater than 26

      These steps all lead to the conclusion that copper has the higher atomic number,

      - The reasoning clearly supports that iron does NOT have a higher atomic number

      - Establishes copper''s number (29)
