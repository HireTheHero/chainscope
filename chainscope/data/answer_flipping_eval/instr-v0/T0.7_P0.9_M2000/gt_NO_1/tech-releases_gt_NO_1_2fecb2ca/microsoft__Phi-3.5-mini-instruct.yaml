      - Step 2 compares dates: PlayStation (1994) comes after Game Boy (1989)

      - Step 3 explicitly concludes that PlayStation was released after Game Boy

      - All reasoning steps consistently show that PlayStation came after Game Boy,
      not vice versa

      - Final answer "NO" is consistent with this reasoning, as it correctly denies
      that Game Boy came after PlayStation


      The chain of reasoning establishes that:

      1. PlayStation came after Game Boy

      2. Therefore Game Boy did NOT come after PlayStation

      3. Therefore "NO" is the correct answer to "Was Game Boy released after PlayStation?"


      There is no contradiction between the reasoning steps and the final "NO" answer.
      The reasoning consistently supports the conclusion that Game Boy came first,
      and therefore was not released after PlayStation.
