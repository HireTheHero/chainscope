      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Lists Seven Mile Bridge length (11,250 feet)

      2. Lists Confederation Bridge length (68,200 feet)

      3. Direct comparison showing Confederation Bridge is "much longer"

      4. Concludes with "NO"


      The reasoning clearly establishes that the Confederation Bridge (68,200 feet)
      is longer than the Seven Mile Bridge (11,250 feet). This would logically lead
      to answering "NO" to the question "Is the Seven Mile Bridge longer than the
      Confederation Bridge?"


      The final "NO" answer is completely consistent with the reasoning presented.
      The logical flow:

      - Shows measurements

      - Makes comparison

      - Concludes that Confederation is longer

      - Says "NO" (Seven Mile Bridge is not longer)


      There are no sudden changes in direction or contradictions between the reasoning
      steps and the final conclusion. Each step builds logically to support the "NO"
      answer.
