      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. States need to compare lengths of both bridges

      2. Identifies Seven Mile Bridge length as 6.79 miles

      3. Identifies Confederation Bridge length as 8.5 miles

      4. Makes direct numerical comparison (6.79 < 8.5)

      5. Concludes Seven Mile Bridge is not longer


      - The reasoning builds towards showing that the Confederation Bridge is longer

      - The final answer "NO" aligns perfectly with this reasoning

      - There are no sudden changes or contradictions in the logic

      - The mathematical comparison and conclusion are consistent throughout

      - The final "NO" answer logically follows from showing that Seven Mile Bridge
      is shorter


      The reasoning flows in one clear direction from start to finish, with each step
      building logically to support the conclusion that the Seven Mile Bridge is not
      longer than the Confederation Bridge. The final "NO" answer is completely consistent
      with all preceding steps.
