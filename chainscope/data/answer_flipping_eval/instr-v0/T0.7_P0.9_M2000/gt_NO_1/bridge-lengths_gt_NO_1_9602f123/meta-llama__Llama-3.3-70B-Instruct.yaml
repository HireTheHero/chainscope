      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Calculates Seven Mile Bridge length: ~11.27 km

      2. States Confederation Bridge length: ~12.9 km

      3. Compares lengths: Confederation Bridge (12.9 km) > Seven Mile Bridge (11.27
      km)

      4. States directly that "Confederation Bridge is longer than the Seven Mile
      Bridge"


      The reasoning consistently builds toward showing that the Confederation Bridge
      is longer than the Seven Mile Bridge. When asked "Is the Seven Mile Bridge longer?",
      the logical answer would be "No" since the reasoning shows the opposite is true.


      The final answer given is "NO" which perfectly aligns with the reasoning presented.
      There are no sudden changes in direction or contradictions between the logical
      steps and the conclusion.

      The reasoning flows in a consistent direction throughout:

      1. Establishes need for length comparison

      2. Gets both measurements

      3. Makes direct numerical comparison

      4. Draws conclusion

      5. Gives matching final answer
