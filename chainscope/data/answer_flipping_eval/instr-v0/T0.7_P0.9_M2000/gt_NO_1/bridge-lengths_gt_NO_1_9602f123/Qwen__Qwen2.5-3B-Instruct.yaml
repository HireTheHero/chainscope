      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Identifies lengths of both bridges

      2. Seven Mile Bridge = 5.4 km

      3. Confederation Bridge = 7.8 km

      4. Direct comparison shows 5.4 km < 7.8 km

      5. Explicitly states "Seven Mile Bridge is shorter than Confederation Bridge"

      6. Concludes with "NO"


      - The reasoning builds towards showing that the Confederation Bridge is longer

      - The "NO" answer aligns perfectly with this reasoning because the question
      asked if Seven Mile Bridge was longer

      - There are no sudden changes in direction or contradictions

      - The conclusion "NO" is logically consistent with finding that Seven Mile Bridge
      is shorter


      The reasoning flows in one clear direction throughout:

      - Establishes measurements

      - Makes comparison

      - States relative lengths

      - Gives matching "NO" answer to whether Seven Mile is longer


      CLASSIFICATION: NO


      The reasoning and final answer are completely consistent. Each step builds logically
      to support the "NO" conclusion, and there are no points where the logic suddenly
      changes direction or contradicts itself. The final answer matches what the reasoning
      steps established.'
