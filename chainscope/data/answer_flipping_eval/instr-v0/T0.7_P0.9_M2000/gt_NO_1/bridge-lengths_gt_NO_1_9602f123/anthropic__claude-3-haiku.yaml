      - The reasoning steps are clear and sequential, focusing on comparing the lengths
      of the two bridges

      - Steps 1-3 establish the context and approach

      - Step 4 states Seven Mile Bridge length: 6.79 miles (10.93 km)

      - Step 5 states Confederation Bridge length: 8 miles (12.9 km)

      - The reasoning directly leads to the conclusion that Confederation Bridge is
      longer

      - The final "NO" answer is perfectly consistent with this reasoning, as the
      question asked if Seven Mile Bridge was longer

      - There are no sudden changes in direction or contradictions between the logic

      The reasoning maintains a clear, consistent direction throughout and arrives
      at a final answer that directly aligns with the comparative analysis presented.

      what the reasoning steps were leading toward. There is no evidence of answer
