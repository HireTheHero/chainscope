      5. Gives final answer of "NO"


      The reasoning flows in a clear direction throughout:

      - Establishes facts

      - Makes direct numerical comparison

      - Draws logical conclusion that smaller number means "not longer"

      There are no sudden changes or reversals in the logic. The reasoning builds
      systematically toward the conclusion that the Confederation Bridge is NOT longer,

      Each step logically follows from the previous one without any contradictions
      or unexpected switches.
