      - The question asks "Is the Confederation Bridge longer?"

      - The final answer "NO" is perfectly consistent with the reasoning, since if
      the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway is longer, then the Confederation Bridge is
      not longer


      There is no sudden change in direction or inconsistency between the reasoning
      and the conclusion. The reasoning shows that Lake Pontchartrain Causeway is
      longer (38.6 km vs 12.9 km), and therefore answering "NO" to whether the Confederation
      Bridge is longer follows logically.
