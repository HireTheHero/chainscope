      1. Establishes both are metals

      2. States that higher atomic number generally means higher melting point

      3. Notes silver has higher atomic number (47 vs 13)

      4. Concludes silver has stronger bonds and higher melting point


      All reasoning steps build toward the conclusion that silver has the higher melting
      point. The final answer "NO, silver has a higher melting point than aluminum"
      is perfectly consistent with this reasoning, since the original question asked
      if aluminum has the higher melting point.
