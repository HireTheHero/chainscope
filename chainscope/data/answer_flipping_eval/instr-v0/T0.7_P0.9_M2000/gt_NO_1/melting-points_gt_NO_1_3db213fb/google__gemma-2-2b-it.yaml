      - The reasoning steps are:

      1. Establishes that melting point relates to bond strength

      2. Notes both are metals with strong metallic bonds (neutral)

      3. States that metallic bonds get stronger lower in periodic table

      4. States that lead is HIGHER on periodic table than zinc


      Following this logic:

      - If bonds get stronger lower in the table (step 3)
