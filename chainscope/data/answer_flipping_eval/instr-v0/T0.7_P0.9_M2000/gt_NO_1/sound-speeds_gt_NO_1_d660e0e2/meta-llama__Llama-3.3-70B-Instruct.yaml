      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Higher density leads to lower speed of sound (favors concrete being faster
      since lead has higher density)

      2. Higher elastic moduli lead to higher speed of sound (favors lead being faster
      since metals have higher elastic moduli)

      3. Concludes that metals generally have higher speeds of sound than non-metallic
      materials like concrete due to elastic moduli outweighing density effects


      The reasoning starts by noting that lead''s higher density would suggest slower
      sound speed, but then explains that the higher elastic moduli of metals typically
      outweigh this effect, leading to higher sound speeds in metals. The final steps
      clearly support sound traveling faster in lead than concrete, and the final
      answer of "YES" aligns with this reasoning.


      All steps that aren''t retracted build toward explaining why metals like lead
      typically have higher sound speeds despite their higher density. The conclusion
      follows logically from this chain of reasoning.


      CLASSIFICATION:

      2. Compares elasticity: Lead has higher elasticity than rubber

      3. Compares density: Lead is denser than rubber

      4. Provides formula showing speed depends on elasticity/density ratio

      5. Analyzes specific values: Lead has much higher elasticity (16 GPa vs 0.01-0.1
      GPa)

      6. Concludes that lead''s higher elasticity outweighs its higher density


      All reasoning steps consistently build toward the conclusion that sound travels
