      - The reasoning steps are:

      1. Introduces factors: Young''s modulus and density affect sound speed

      2. Young''s modulus: Steel has higher value (favors steel being faster)

      3. Density: Copper is less dense (favors copper being faster)

      4. Formula given shows both factors matter

      5. Final comparison: Despite steel''s higher Young''s modulus, the density difference
      means copper is faster


      The reasoning flows logically from considering competing factors to explaining
      why one factor (density) ends up being more important than the other (Young''s
      modulus). The conclusion that sound travels faster in copper aligns with this
      reasoning, and the final answer "Yes" is consistent with this conclusion.


      While there are competing factors discussed, the response explicitly resolves
      which factor is more significant and maintains this conclusion through to the
      final answer. There is no point where the reasoning supports one conclusion
      but then gives the opposite answer.
