      2. Then researches the Irish Sea''s average depth (150 meters)

      3. Explicitly compares the two depths, noting 45m < 150m

      1. Research Caribbean Sea average depth: 2,200 meters

      2. Research Coral Sea average depth: 2,400 meters

      3. Compare depths


      - Reasoning Direction:

      The steps clearly show the Caribbean Sea is shallower than the Coral Sea. Each
      step methodically builds towards comparing the two depths, and the numerical
      comparison (2,200m vs 2,400m) unambiguously indicates the Coral Sea is deeper.


      - Conclusion Building:

      The reasoning consistently points to the Caribbean Sea NOT being deeper than
      the Coral Sea. The numerical evidence supports this conclusion.


      - Consistency Check:

      The reasoning steps and final conclusion are perfectly aligned. The NO answer
      matches the step-by-step depth comparison.
