      - The reasoning steps clearly build toward showing that a lion is faster than

      3. States ostrich speed (43 mph)

      4. States zebra speed (40 mph)


      The reasoning consistently builds toward showing that ostriches are faster than
      zebras by:

      - First establishing both animals are known for speed

      - Then providing specific speed measurements showing ostriches are 3 mph faster


      The final answer "YES" aligns perfectly with the reasoning presented, as the

      can run faster than zebras.


      There are no sudden changes in direction or inconsistencies between the reasoning

      3. Smaller, agile animals are faster than larger, heavy ones

      2. Gorillas are strong/muscular (suggests faster)

      3. Hippos only quick in bursts (suggests slower)

      All reasoning steps support the conclusion that gorillas are faster than hippos.
      The text explicitly states "Therefore, a gorilla can likely run faster than

      However, the final answer given is "YES" which actually contradicts both the
      reasoning and the stated conclusion, since the original question asked if a
      hippopotamus can run faster than a gorilla. A "YES" answer means the hippo is
      faster, which goes against all the presented reasoning.
