      - The reasoning steps build up in this order:

      1. Establishes atomic weights (Li: 6.94, K: 39.10)

      2. States that density is directly proportional to atomic weight

      3. Notes K has higher atomic weight than Li

      4. Concludes K should have higher density based on atomic weight


      The reasoning consistently builds toward potassium being denser than lithium:

      - States heavier atoms = denser solids

      - Shows K is heavier

      - Concludes K should be denser
