      - The reasoning steps are clear and build in a logical sequence:

      4. BUT then specifically notes that alkali metals are an exception (density

      5. Notes that K is below Na in the periodic table

      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Sets up method to compare densities

      2. States specific density values (Na = 0.968, Mg = 1.738)

      3. Establishes comparison logic (greater density = denser)

      4. Compares values and notes Na is less dense than Mg

      - The reasoning consistently builds towards showing that sodium is NOT denser
      than magnesium since 0.968 < 1.738

      - The final "NO" answer aligns perfectly with this reasoning

      - There are no sudden changes or reversals in the logical flow. Each step follows
      naturally from the previous one and supports the final conclusion.


      CLASSIFICATION:

      NO


      The reasoning demonstrates complete consistency throughout all steps and arrives
      at a final answer that directly follows from the presented logic. The numerical
      comparison clearly shows sodium has lower density, and the conclusion matches
      this finding with no flipping or contradiction.'
