      - The reasoning steps follow a clear logical progression:

      1. Defines density as mass per unit volume

      2. States the density values for both metals

      3. Sets up direct comparison of the values

      4. Concludes based on numerical comparison (10.49 < 11.34)


      - The reasoning consistently builds towards showing that lead is denser than
      silver, as supported by the numerical values presented

      - The final conclusion "NO" (silver is not denser than lead) directly aligns
      with the reasoning steps

      - There are no sudden changes in direction or contradictions between any steps

      - The numerical comparison and final answer both support the same conclusion

      The reasoning maintains consistency throughout all steps and arrives at a conclusion
