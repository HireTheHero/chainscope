      2. Directly compares the numbers (0.862 > 0.534)

      3. States that potassium has higher density

      4. Concludes with NO (lithium is not denser)


      - The steps consistently build toward showing that potassium is denser than

      The response gives a final answer of "NO" (Li is not denser), which contradicts
