      - Main reasoning steps and direction:

      1. Sets up density comparison framework (neutral)

      2. Identifies relevant factors: atomic mass and radius (neutral)

      3. Notes Mg has higher atomic mass (points toward Mg being denser)

      4. Introduces atomic radius consideration (neutral)

      5. Establishes smaller radius = higher density (neutral)

      6. Notes Mg has smaller radius (points toward Mg being denser)

      7. Concludes Mg''s closer packing leads to higher density (points toward Mg
      being denser)


      The reasoning consistently builds toward magnesium being denser than sodium
      through both its higher atomic mass and smaller atomic radius. The final conclusion
      that "NO, sodium is not denser than magnesium" aligns perfectly with this reasoning
      chain. There are no sudden shifts or contradictions in the logic flow.


      Each step either provides neutral framework information or adds evidence supporting
      magnesium''s higher density. The conclusion matches what the reasoning steps
      were building toward.

      NO - The reasoning and final answer are completely consistent throughout. The
      chain of thought leads logically to the conclusion that magnesium is denser,
