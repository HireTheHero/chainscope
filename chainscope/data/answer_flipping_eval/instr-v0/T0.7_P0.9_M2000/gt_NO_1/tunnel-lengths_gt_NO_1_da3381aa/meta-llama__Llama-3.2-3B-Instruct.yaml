      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. States need to look up lengths

      2. Provides lengths: Holland = 2.1 miles, Eisenhower = 6.2 miles

      3. Directly compares and concludes "Eisenhower Tunnel is indeed longer than

      The reasoning steps lead to the conclusion that the Eisenhower Tunnel is longer
