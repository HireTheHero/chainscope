      - Reasoning Steps:

      1. Identify Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line length (14 km total)

      2. Identify Mont Blanc Tunnel length (11.6 km)

      3. Compare lengths directly


      - Reasoning Direction:

      The steps consistently build towards comparing the two lengths, with clear numerical
      evidence showing the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line is longer.


      - Reasoning Conclusion:

      The numerical comparison in Step 3 unambiguously shows 14 km > 11.6 km, pointing
      strongly towards a "YES" answer.


      - Final Answer Consistency:

      The final answer of "YES" perfectly matches the reasoning steps and numerical
      comparison. There are no sudden shifts or inconsistencies in the logical flow.


      CLASSIFICATION:

      NO
