      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Identifies both tunnels

      2. States Zion-Mount Carmel length as 1.1 miles

      3. States Queens-Midtown length as 1.22 miles

      4. Makes explicit comparison stating Queens-Midtown is "slightly longer"


      All reasoning steps lead to the conclusion that the Queens-Midtown Tunnel is
      longer than the Zion-Mount Carmel Tunnel. The question asks if Zion-Mount Carmel
      is longer than Queens-Midtown, so this reasoning supports a "NO" answer.


      The final answer given is "NO", which is consistent with all the reasoning steps.

      - Reasoning direction:

      The steps are systematically comparing the lengths of the two tunnels, with
