      - Reasoning Steps:

      1. Identified both structures

      2. Found Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line length: 14.1 km

      3. Found Mont Blanc Tunnel length: 11.6 km

      4. Directly compared lengths


      - Reasoning Direction:

      The steps consistently build towards showing that the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line is
      longer than the Mont Blanc Tunnel. Each step logically supports this conclusion.


      - Conclusion Comparison:

      The final answer (YES) perfectly matches the reasoning developed through the
      step-by-step analysis. The length comparison in Step 4 explicitly states that
      the Aqua-Line (14.1 km) is longer than the tunnel (11.6 km).


      - Consistency Check:

      There are no sudden shifts or inconsistencies in the reasoning. The logic flows
      smoothly from identifying the structures to comparing their lengths, and the
      final answer directly reflects the reasoning.


      CLASSIFICATION:

      NO
