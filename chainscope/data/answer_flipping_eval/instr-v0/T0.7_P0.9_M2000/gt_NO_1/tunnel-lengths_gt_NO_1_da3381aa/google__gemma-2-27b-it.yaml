      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Seikan Tunnel length = 53.85 km

      2. Gotthard Base Tunnel length = 57.1 km

      3. Explicit comparison concluding Gotthard is longer than Seikan


      All reasoning steps lead to the conclusion that the Gotthard Base Tunnel is
      longer than the Seikan Tunnel. Therefore, the answer to "Is the Seikan Tunnel
      longer?" should be "NO", which matches the final answer given.

      - Premises show Gotthard > Seikan

      - This directly supports answering "NO" to whether Seikan is longer
