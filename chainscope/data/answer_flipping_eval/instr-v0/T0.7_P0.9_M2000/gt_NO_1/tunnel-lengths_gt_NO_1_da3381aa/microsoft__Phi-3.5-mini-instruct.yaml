      - Reasoning steps:

      1. First step involves identifying tunnel lengths

      2. Second step sets up a comparison of those lengths

      3. Third step provides the actual length measurements


      - Reasoning direction:

      The steps systematically build towards a clear length comparison, with the measurements
      showing Simplon Tunnel (19,811m) is longer than St. Gotthard Road Tunnel (15,411m)


      - Conclusion building:

      The reasoning consistently points towards the conclusion that the St. Gotthard
      Road Tunnel is NOT longer than the Simplon Tunnel


      - Consistency check:

      The final answer "NO, the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel is not longer than the Simplon
      Tunnel" directly matches the logical progression of the reasoning steps


      There are no sudden shifts, contradictions, or unexpected changes in the reasoning.
