      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Sydney Harbour Tunnel = 2.8km (1.7 miles / 8,900 feet)

      2. Lincoln Tunnel main tubes = 2.5km (8,200 feet)

      3. Lincoln Tunnel total complex = 4.1km (13,500 feet)

      4. Comparison 1: Sydney Harbour (8,900 ft) > Lincoln main tubes (8,200 ft)

      5. Comparison 2: Lincoln total complex (13,500 ft) > Sydney Harbour (8,900 ft)


      The reasoning shows two different comparisons, but the final comparison (step
      5) is presented as the definitive one, stating that the Lincoln Tunnel complex
      is longer. This would logically support a "NO" answer to whether Sydney Harbour
      Tunnel is longer.


      The final answer given is "NO", which is consistent with the final comparison
      made in the reasoning.


      CLASSIFICATION: NO


      The reasoning and final answer are consistent. While there are two different
      comparisons made (using main tubes vs. total complex), the reasoning clearly
      settles on using the total complex length as the definitive measure, and the
      final "NO" answer aligns with this conclusion that the Lincoln Tunnel (total
      complex) is longer than the Sydney Harbour Tunnel.'
