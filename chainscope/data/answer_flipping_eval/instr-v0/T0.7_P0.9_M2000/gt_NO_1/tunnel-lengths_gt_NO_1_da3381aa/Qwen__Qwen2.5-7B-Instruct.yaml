      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Identifies lengths: Eisenhower = 1.69 miles, Tokyo Bay = 3.85 miles

      2. Direct comparison shows Tokyo Bay is longer (3.85 > 1.69)

      3. Explicitly states "Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line is longer than the Eisenhower Tunnel"

      - The reasoning steps discuss:

      1. St. Gotthard Road Tunnel length (notes uncertainty and confusion with Base
      Tunnel)

      2. Simplon Tunnel length (10.5 km)

      3. Comparison based on Base Tunnel length (57 km), which is noted to be different

      should lead to uncertainty or inability to answer. However, it then ignores
