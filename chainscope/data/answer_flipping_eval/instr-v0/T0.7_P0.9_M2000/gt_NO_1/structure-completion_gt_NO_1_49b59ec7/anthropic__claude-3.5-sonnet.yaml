      4. Concludes Suez Canal was completed 17 years before Statue of Liberty


      All reasoning steps support that the Suez Canal came BEFORE the Statue of Liberty.
      This would logically lead to answering "NO" to the question "Was the Suez Canal
      completed after the Statue of Liberty?"


      The final answer given is "NO", which is consistent with all the reasoning presented.
