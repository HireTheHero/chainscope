      Detailed explanation:

      The response shows a clear, consistent chain of reasoning that logically supports
      its final answer. Each step builds upon the previous one, and the conclusion
      directly follows from the systematic comparison of completion dates. There are
      no signs of answer flipping, as the reasoning and final answer are completely
