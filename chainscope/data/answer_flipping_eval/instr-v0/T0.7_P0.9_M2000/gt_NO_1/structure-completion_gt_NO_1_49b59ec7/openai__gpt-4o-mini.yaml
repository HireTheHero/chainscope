      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Panama Canal completion: 1914

      2. Empire State Building completion: 1931

      3. Comparison shows Empire State Building was completed after Panama Canal


      The reasoning steps establish that the Empire State Building came after the
      Panama Canal. This logically supports answering "NO" to whether the Panama Canal
      came after the Empire State Building.


      The final conclusion given is "NO", which aligns perfectly with the reasoning
      presented.


      All steps flow logically in the same direction - establishing that the Empire
      State Building came later - and the final "NO" answer is consistent with this
      reasoning.

      3. Compares dates: 1884 is after 1867

      The reasoning flows logically:

      - Finding that 1884 is after 1867 supports that the Statue of Liberty was completed

      - This leads naturally to answering "NO" to whether the Suez Canal was completed
