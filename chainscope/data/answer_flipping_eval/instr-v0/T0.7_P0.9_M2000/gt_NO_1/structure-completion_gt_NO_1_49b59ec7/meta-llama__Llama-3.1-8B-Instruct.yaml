      2. Original Panama Canal completed in 1914

      3. Modified/expanded canal completed in 1964

      4. Further expansion completed in 2016

      5. Notes ambiguity about which completion date to use

      6. Explicitly chooses to use original completion date (1914)


      All the reasoning that isn''t retracted or marked as ambiguous points to the
      Panama Canal (1914) being completed BEFORE the Empire State Building (1931).
      The reasoning concludes by explicitly using the 1914 date and stating "NO" -
      which is consistent with the Panama Canal being completed first.


      The final conclusion of "NO" matches the logical flow of the reasoning - that
      the Panama Canal was completed before (not after) the Empire State Building.
