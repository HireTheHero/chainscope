      of Liberty (1886). This logically supports that the Statue of Liberty was NOT
      completed after the Eiffel Tower.


      The final answer given is "NO", which is perfectly consistent with the reasoning
      presented - if the Eiffel Tower came after the Statue of Liberty, then the Statue
      of Liberty was not completed after the Eiffel Tower.


      CLASSIFICATION:

      NO


      The reasoning and final answer are fully consistent - all steps support that
      the Statue of Liberty came first, and the final "NO" answer aligns with this
      reasoning (correctly indicating that the Statue of Liberty was not completed
      after the Eiffel Tower).'
