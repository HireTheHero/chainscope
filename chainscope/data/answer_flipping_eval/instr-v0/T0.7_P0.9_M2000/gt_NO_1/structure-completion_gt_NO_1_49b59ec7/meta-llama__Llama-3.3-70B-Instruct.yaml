      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Ming Dynasty Great Wall construction was ongoing through 15th-16th centuries
      and into 17th century

      2. Taj Mahal was completed in 1653

      3. Ming Dynasty ended in 1644, before Taj Mahal completion

      4. Notes that while some wall work continued after 1632, the Ming Dynasty project
      ended in 1644 (before Taj Mahal''s 1653 completion)


      All the reasoning steps point to the Ming Dynasty Great Wall NOT being completed
      after the Taj Mahal, since:

      - The Ming Dynasty (and its wall construction) ended in 1644

      - The Taj Mahal wasn''t completed until 1653

      - The reasoning explicitly notes that the Ming Dynasty had ended "by the time

      after the Taj Mahal, which contradicts all the presented reasoning.
