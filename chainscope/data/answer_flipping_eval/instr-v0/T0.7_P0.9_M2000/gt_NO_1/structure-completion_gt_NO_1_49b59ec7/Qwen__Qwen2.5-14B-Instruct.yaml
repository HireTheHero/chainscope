      All reasoning steps consistently support that the Golden Gate Bridge was completed

      3. Explicit comparison stating 1931 comes after 1914

      All reasoning steps consistently support that the Empire State Building came
      AFTER the Panama Canal, which logically leads to answering "NO" to whether the
