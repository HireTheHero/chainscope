      3. Explicitly states they have the same height

      - The reasoning builds towards showing they are equal in height

      - The final "NO" answer aligns perfectly with the conclusion that since they''re

      - There are no sudden changes in direction - the logic flows smoothly from establishing
      equal heights to concluding one is not taller than the other


      The reasoning maintains consistency throughout:

      - Premises: Both are same height

      - Logic: Same height means one isn''t taller than the other

      - Conclusion: NO (RDJ is not taller)
