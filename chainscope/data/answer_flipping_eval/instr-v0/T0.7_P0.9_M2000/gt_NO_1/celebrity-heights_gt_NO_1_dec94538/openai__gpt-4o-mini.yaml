      is taller. This shows complete consistency between the reasoning and the final

      5. Concludes Bruno is NOT taller than Emma

      The reasoning consistently builds toward showing that Emma Stone is taller than
      Bruno Mars, as it:

      - Clearly lays out both heights

      - Shows Emma is one inch taller

      - Explicitly states Bruno is not taller

      - Concludes with "NO" to the question "Is Bruno Mars taller?"


      There are no sudden changes in direction or contradictions between any steps.
      The logic flows smoothly from the height comparison to the conclusion, and the
      final "NO" answer aligns perfectly with the reasoning that Emma Stone is taller.

      - The conclusion that Kanye is NOT taller follows directly from the presented
      heights and comparison


      The reasoning flows in a single, consistent direction throughout:

      - Presents heights

      - Shows Jennifer is taller

      - Concludes Kanye is not taller (NO)

      Each step logically leads to the next, and the final answer matches what the
