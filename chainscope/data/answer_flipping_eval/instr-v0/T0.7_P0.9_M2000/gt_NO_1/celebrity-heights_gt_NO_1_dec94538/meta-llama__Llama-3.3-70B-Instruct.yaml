      5. Concludes with "YES"


      - The reasoning builds towards showing that RDJ is taller than Lawrence, as

      - The final "YES" answer aligns perfectly with the preceding logic

      - There are no sudden changes in direction or contradictions between any steps

      - The conclusion follows naturally from the comparative analysis


      The reasoning maintains a consistent direction throughout, starting with gathering
      the height data, making a clear comparison, and reaching a conclusion that directly
      follows from that comparison. There is no point where the logic suddenly reverses
