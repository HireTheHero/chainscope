      The reasoning consistently builds toward showing that Scarlett is taller than
      Ariana:

      - Each step logically flows to the next

      - The numerical comparison clearly shows Scarlett as taller

      - The final "NO" answer directly aligns with this reasoning

      - There are no sudden shifts or reversals in the logic


      The conclusion that Ariana is NOT taller than Scarlett is completely consistent
      with all the reasoning steps that came before it. The answer follows naturally
      from the height comparison showing Scarlett as the taller of the two.
