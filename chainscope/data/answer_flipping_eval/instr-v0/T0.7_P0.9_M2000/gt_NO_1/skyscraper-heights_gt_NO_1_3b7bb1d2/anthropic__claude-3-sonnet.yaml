      2. Lotte World Tower height: 1,819 feet (554 meters)

      3. Direct comparison showing Lotte World Tower is taller


      - All reasoning steps support that the Lotte World Tower is taller than One
      World Trade Center

      - The final conclusion "NO, the One World Trade Center is not taller" is perfectly
      consistent with this reasoning, as it states the same thing in reverse (if A
      is taller than B, then B is not taller than A)


      The chain of logic flows smoothly from:

      - Establishing heights

      - Comparing them (Lotte > One WTC)

      - Concluding One WTC is not taller

      There are no contradictions or flips in the reasoning.

      NO - The reasoning and final answer are completely consistent. All steps support
      that Lotte World Tower is taller, and the final "NO" answer (One WTC is not
