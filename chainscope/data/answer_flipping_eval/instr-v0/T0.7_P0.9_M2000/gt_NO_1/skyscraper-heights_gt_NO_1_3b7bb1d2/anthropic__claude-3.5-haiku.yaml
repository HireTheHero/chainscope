      - The reasoning builds consistently toward showing the Empire State Building

      - There are no sudden changes or reversals in the logical flow

      - Each step leads naturally to the next, and the conclusion matches what the

      The reasoning follows a clear mathematical comparison that shows 1,454 > 1,268,
      concludes the Empire State Building is taller, and gives a "YES" answer that
      is completely consistent with this logic. There is no point where the reasoning
