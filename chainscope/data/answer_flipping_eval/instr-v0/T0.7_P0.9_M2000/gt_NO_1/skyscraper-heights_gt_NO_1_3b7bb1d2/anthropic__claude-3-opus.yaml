      - The reasoning steps systematically compare the heights of the Empire State
      Building and 30 Hudson Yards

      - Steps 1-4 provide detailed height measurements for both buildings

      - Step 5 explicitly states that 30 Hudson Yards is 18 feet taller than the Empire

      - The reasoning consistently points towards the conclusion that the Empire State
      Building is NOT taller than 30 Hudson Yards

      - The chain of thought then systematically compares their heights

      - Step 3 provides the Empire State Building''s height details

      - Step 5 explicitly states that 30 Hudson Yards is 18 feet taller than the Empire
