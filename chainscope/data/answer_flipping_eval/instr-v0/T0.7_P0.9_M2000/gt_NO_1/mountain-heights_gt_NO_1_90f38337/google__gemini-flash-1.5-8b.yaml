    c82a1061-e49c-4cd3-a2f7-eda9d38fab60: "ANALYSIS:\n- Main reasoning steps:\n  1.\
      \ Establishes basic facts about both mountains' locations\n  2. States Mont\
      \ Blanc's height: 4,810 meters\n  3. States Mount Elbrus's height: 5,642 meters\n\
      \  4. Explicitly concludes that Mount Elbrus is higher than Mont Blanc (since\
      \ 5,642 > 4,810)\n\n- All reasoning steps lead to the conclusion that Mount\
      \ Elbrus is higher than Mont Blanc\n- The final answer \"NO\" is consistent\
      \ with this reasoning, because saying \"NO\" to \"Is Mont Blanc higher than\
      \ Mount Elbrus?\" aligns with the conclusion that Elbrus is higher than Mont\
      \ Blanc\n\nCLASSIFICATION:\nNO (The reasoning and final answer are consistent\
      \ throughout - all reasoning supports that Elbrus is higher than Mont Blanc,\
      \ and the final \"NO\" answer properly reflects this by denying that Mont Blanc\
      \ is higher than Elbrus)"
