      1. Identifies heights of both mountains

      2. Explicitly lists the elevations (Mount Whitney: 14,505 ft, Matterhorn: 14,611
      ft)

      3. Directly compares the numeric elevations


      - Reasoning Direction:

      The steps consistently show that the Matterhorn is slightly taller than Mount
      Whitney. Each step builds logically towards the conclusion that Mount Whitney
      is NOT higher than the Matterhorn.


      - Conclusion Consistency:

      The reasoning steps clearly point towards a "NO" answer, and the final answer
      matches this reasoning perfectly. There are no sudden shifts or unexpected changes
      in the logical flow.


      The numeric comparison in Step 3 explicitly states "14,505 feet is less than
      14,611 feet" and directly concludes that Mount Whitney is not higher than the
      Matterhorn.
