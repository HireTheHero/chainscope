      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. Finds Matterhorn elevation: 4,478m

      2. Finds Mont Blanc elevation: 4,810m

      3. Compares them: States Mont Blanc is greater than Matterhorn

      - These steps logically support that Mont Blanc is higher than Matterhorn, which
      would lead to a "NO" answer to "Is The Matterhorn higher than Mont Blanc?"

      2. None of the reasoning is retracted or ignored
