      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. States Mont Blanc''s elevation: 4,808 meters

      2. States Matterhorn''s elevation: 4,478 meters

      3. Compares them: Mont Blanc is 330 meters taller than Matterhorn


      - All reasoning steps clearly support that Mont Blanc is higher than Matterhorn,
      which means the Matterhorn is NOT higher than Mont Blanc

      - The final conclusion is "NO" which directly aligns with the reasoning (since
      the question asked if Matterhorn is higher)


      The chain of reasoning consistently builds toward showing that Mont Blanc is
      taller, and the "NO" answer properly reflects this conclusion. There are no
      retractions or ignored steps, and the final answer matches what the reasoning
      supports.
