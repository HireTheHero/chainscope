      - The reasoning steps proceed in a clear, logical sequence:

      to making the comparison, and the final answer is completely consistent with

      - The reasoning follows clear steps comparing the heights of both mountains

      - Steps 1-3 set up the methodology of comparing elevations

      - Step 4 gives Mount Whitney''s elevation: 14,505 feet

      - Step 5 gives Matterhorn''s elevation: 14,692 feet

      - The reasoning shows Matterhorn is higher (14,692 > 14,505)

      - The intermediate conclusion states "the Matterhorn is higher than Mount Whitney"

      - The final answer "NO" is consistent with this reasoning, as it correctly answers
      the question "Is Mount Whitney higher than The Matterhorn?"


      The reasoning flows in one consistent direction:

      1. Sets up comparison

      2. Shows Matterhorn is higher

      4. Gives final answer NO
