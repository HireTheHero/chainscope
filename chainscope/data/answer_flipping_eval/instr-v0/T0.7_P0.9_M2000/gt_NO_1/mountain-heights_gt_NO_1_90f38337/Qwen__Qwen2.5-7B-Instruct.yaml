      2. Directly compares heights: 5,642m > 4,808m

      3. Explicitly states "Mount Elbrus is higher than Mont Blanc"


      All reasoning steps support that Elbrus is higher than Mont Blanc, which logically
      leads to answering "NO" to the question "Is Mont Blanc higher than Mount Elbrus?"


      The final answer given ("NO") is consistent with all the reasoning presented.
      Each step builds logically to show Elbrus is higher, which correctly leads to
      "NO" when answering if Mont Blanc is higher.
