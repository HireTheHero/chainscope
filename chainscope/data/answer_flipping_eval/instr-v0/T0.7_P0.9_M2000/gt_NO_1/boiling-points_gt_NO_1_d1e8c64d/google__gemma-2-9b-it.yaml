      1. Defines boiling point

      2. Establishes that metallic bonding affects boiling point

      3. States copper has stronger metallic bonds than iron

      4. Explains that stronger bonds = higher boiling point


      The reasoning builds consistently toward the conclusion that copper would have
      a higher boiling point than iron because:

      - It establishes that stronger metallic bonds lead to higher boiling points

      - It claims copper has stronger metallic bonds than iron

      - The final conclusion that copper has a higher boiling point follows directly
      from these premises


      The final answer "YES" is completely consistent with the reasoning chain. There
      are no sudden shifts or contradictions between the logical steps and the conclusion.
      Each step builds naturally to support the final answer.

      4. Establishes that more hydrogen bonds lead to higher boiling points

      boiling point than ethanol because:

      - Both have hydrogen bonding

      not have a higher boiling point than nitrogen. There are no sudden changes or
