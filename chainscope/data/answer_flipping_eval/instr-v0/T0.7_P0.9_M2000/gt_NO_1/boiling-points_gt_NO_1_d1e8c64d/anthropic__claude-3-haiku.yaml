      \ has the higher boiling point:\n- Each step logically follows from the previous\
      \ one\n- The direction is clear: oxygen > nitrogen in terms of:\n  * Molar mass\n\
      \  * Molecular size\n  * Van der Waals forces\n  * Boiling point\n\nThe final\
      \ answer \"NO, nitrogen does not have a higher boiling point than oxygen\" is\
      \ completely consistent with this reasoning chain. There are no sudden reversals\
      \ or contradictions between the logical steps and the conclusion.\n\nCLASSIFICATION:\n\
      NO - The reasoning and final answer are consistent throughout. The chain of\
      \ thought builds logically toward the conclusion that oxygen has the higher\
      \ boiling point, and the final \"NO\" answer aligns perfectly with this reasoning."
