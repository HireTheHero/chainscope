      The response consists of just a final answer with no explanation or logical

      \ and linear:\n1. States mercury's boiling point (356.7\xB0C)\n2. States lead's\
      \ boiling point (1749\xB0C)\n3. Directly compares the two values, noting lead's\
      \ is \"significantly higher\"\n4. Concludes that mercury does NOT have a higher\

      \ has a higher boiling point than mercury\n- The final answer (\"No, mercury\
      \ does not have a higher boiling point than lead\") is perfectly consistent\
