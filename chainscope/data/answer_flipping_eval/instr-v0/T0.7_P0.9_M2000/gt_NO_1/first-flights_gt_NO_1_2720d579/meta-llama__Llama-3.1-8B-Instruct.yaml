      2. Nothing in the reasoning is retracted or qualified\n3. The final \"YES\"\

      4. 777-300ER variant introduced in 2004


      The reasoning clearly establishes that the original Boeing 777 (1994) flew before
      the A380 (2005). While it mentions the 777-300ER variant was introduced in 2004,
      this actually still predates the A380''s first flight in 2005.


      All reasoning points to the Boeing 777 flying BEFORE the A380, yet the final
      answer given is "YES" (that the 777 flew after the A380). This is a clear contradiction
      between the reasoning and the conclusion.


      Additionally, the final statement appears to shift focus specifically to the
      777-300ER variant to justify the YES answer, but even this doesn''t support
      the conclusion since the introduction date given (2004) is still before the
      A380''s first flight (2005).
