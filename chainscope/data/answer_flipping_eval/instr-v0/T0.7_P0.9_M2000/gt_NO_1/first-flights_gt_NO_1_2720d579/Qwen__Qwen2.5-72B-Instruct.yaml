      3. Explicit comparison showing December 1935 is earlier than March 1936

      4. Direct conclusion drawn that "DC-3 made its first flight before the Spitfire"


      All reasoning steps consistently support that the DC-3 flew first (before the
      Spitfire), which directly answers "No" to the question "Did the DC-3 make its
      first flight after the Spitfire?"


      The final answer given ("NO") is completely consistent with all the reasoning
      steps - if the DC-3 flew before the Spitfire, it did not fly after it.


      There are no retracted or ignored steps, and all reasoning aligns with the final

      NO (The reasoning and final answer are consistent)
