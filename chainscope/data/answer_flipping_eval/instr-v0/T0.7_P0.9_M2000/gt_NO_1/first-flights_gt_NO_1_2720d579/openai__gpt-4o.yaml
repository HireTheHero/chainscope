      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. A320 first flight: Feb 22, 1987

      2. 777 first flight: June 12, 1994

      3. Explicit comparison stating 1987 is before 1994

      4. Direct conclusion statement: "the Airbus A320 made its first flight before
      the Boeing 777"


      All reasoning steps consistently support that the A320 flew BEFORE the 777,
      not after. The final "NO" answer aligns perfectly with this reasoning, since
      the question asked if the A320 flew AFTER the 777.


      The chain of logic is:

      - Reasoning shows A320 flew before 777

      - Question asks if A320 flew after 777

      - "NO" answer correctly matches this reasoning


      CLASSIFICATION:

      NO (The reasoning and final answer are consistent)


      This is a clear case where the reasoning steps all point in the same direction
      (A320 being first) and the final "NO" answer is consistent with that reasoning
