      2. States Thames length (215 miles)

      3. States Seine length (483 miles)

      4. Explicitly compares: "483 miles is longer than 215 miles"

      5. Concludes: "Therefore, the River Seine is longer than the River Thames"


      All reasoning steps that make a comparison point to the Seine being longer than
      the Thames. The explicit conclusion within the reasoning also states the Seine
      is longer.

      supports one answer (YES - the Seine is longer) but the final answer given (NO)
      is the opposite.
