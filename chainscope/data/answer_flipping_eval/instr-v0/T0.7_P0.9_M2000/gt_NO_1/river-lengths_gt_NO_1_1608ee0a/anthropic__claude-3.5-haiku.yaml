      2. Direct comparison showing Colorado is almost twice as long

      3. Concludes Rhine is NOT longer than Colorado

      4. Final answer: NO


      - The reasoning builds systematically toward showing that the Colorado River
      is longer than the Rhine

      - The final "NO" answer is completely consistent with this reasoning, as the
      question asked if the Rhine was longer

      - Each step logically flows to the next without any sudden changes in direction

      - The conclusion matches exactly what the reasoning steps were building toward

      - There are no points where the logic reverses or contradicts itself

      - The reasoning consistently builds toward showing that the Ganges is longer
      than the Colorado River

      - The final "NO" answer aligns perfectly with this reasoning, since if the Ganges
      is longer, then the Colorado cannot be longer
