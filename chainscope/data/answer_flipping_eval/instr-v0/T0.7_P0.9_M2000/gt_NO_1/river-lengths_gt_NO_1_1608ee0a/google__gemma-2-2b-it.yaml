      1. States need to compare lengths

      2. Ganges length: 2,525 km

      3. Danube length: 2,850 km


      The reasoning shows that the Danube (2,850 km) is longer than the Ganges (2,525
      km).

      The text explicitly states "The River Danube is longer than the River Ganges."


      However, the final answer "YES" to the question "Is the River Ganges longer
      than the River Danube?" contradicts the reasoning, since the reasoning shows
      the Ganges is actually shorter than the Danube.

      The reasoning clearly establishes that the Danube is longer than the Ganges,
