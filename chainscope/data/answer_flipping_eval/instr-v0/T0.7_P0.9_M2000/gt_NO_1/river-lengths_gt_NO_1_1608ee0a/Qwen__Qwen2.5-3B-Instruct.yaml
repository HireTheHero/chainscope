      2. States Yangtze length as 6,300 km

      3. States Amazon length as 6,400 km

      4. Directly compares them, noting Amazon is longer


      All reasoning steps that make a comparison point to the Amazon being longer
      than the Yangtze. The final conclusion "NO" (meaning the Yangtze is not longer
      than the Amazon) aligns perfectly with this reasoning.


      The reasoning flows logically from establishing facts to making a comparison,

      longer than the Yangtze.
