      - The reasoning follows clear mathematical comparison steps:

      1. First establishes Boeing 787''s speed (Mach 0.85 = 561 mph)

      2. Then establishes Boeing 747-400''s speed (Mach 0.855 = 567 mph)

      3. Directly compares the two speeds (567 > 561)

      4. States that 747-400 is "slightly faster"

      5. Concludes with "therefore, the Boeing 787 is not faster"


      The reasoning consistently builds toward showing that the 747-400 is faster
      than the 787. Each step logically leads to the next, and the final "No" answer
      aligns perfectly with the mathematical comparison and stated conclusion that
      the 787 is not faster.


      There are no sudden changes in direction or contradictions between any of the
      steps. The initial setup, the mathematical comparison, the stated conclusion
      within the reasoning, and the final "No" answer all point in the same direction
      and support each other.

      - The final answer "NO" aligns perfectly with this reasoning since the question

      747-400 is consistent with all the presented evidence and reasoning steps.
