      2. States F-22 speed is also Mach 2.25

      3. Notes F-22 has superior performance in other areas, including supercruise


      - The reasoning establishes that both aircraft have equal maximum speeds (Mach

      - The additional information about F-22''s superior performance in other areas

      - Reasoning shows equal speeds

      - Concluding "NO" is logically consistent since equal speeds means one is not
      faster than the other


      There is no point where the reasoning suddenly changes direction or contradicts

      the presented fact that both aircraft have the same maximum speed.
