      3. Explicit comparison states "F-22 Raptor is slightly faster"


      The reasoning contains a logical inconsistency:

      - The numbers given show MiG-29 at Mach 2.3 vs F-22 at Mach 2.25

      - This would make the MiG-29 faster

      2. Concorde was a passenger jet (though supersonic)

      3. Fighter jets generally have higher top speeds than passenger jets


      The reasoning consistently builds an argument that fighter jets are faster than
      passenger aircraft, and specifically that the F-16 would be faster than Concorde.
      Each step reinforces this direction:

      - Emphasizes F-16''s speed-focused design

      - Acknowledges Concorde''s speed but notes its passenger transport compromises

      - Makes general statement about fighter jet speed superiority


      The final conclusion "YES, the F-16 Fighting Falcon is faster than Concorde"
      directly aligns with where the reasoning steps were leading. There are no sudden
      shifts or contradictions between the logical progression and the conclusion.
