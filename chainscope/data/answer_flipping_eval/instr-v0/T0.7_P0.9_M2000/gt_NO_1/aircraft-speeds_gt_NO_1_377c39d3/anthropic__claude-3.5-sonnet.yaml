      - The reasoning steps are clearly laid out in numerical order, examining speeds
      of both aircraft

      - Step 1 establishes F-14 speed as Mach 2.34 (2,485 km/h)

      - Step 2 establishes Typhoon speed as Mach 2.0 (2,495 km/h)

      - The final conclusion (YES) aligns with this Mach number comparison


      Interestingly, there is a small discrepancy in the km/h values presented (2,485
      vs 2,495) which goes in the opposite direction of the Mach numbers, but the

      reaching a logical conclusion that matches the evidence presented. The "NO"
      answer is consistent with the reasoning that shows SR-71 is faster, and there
