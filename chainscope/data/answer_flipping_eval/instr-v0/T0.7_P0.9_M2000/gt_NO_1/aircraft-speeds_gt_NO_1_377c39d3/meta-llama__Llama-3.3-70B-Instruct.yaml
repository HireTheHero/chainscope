      mph numbers to conclude the 787 is faster, and carries this through to the final
      YES answer

      747-400. The numerical comparisons (1,500+ mph vs 647 mph) and the explicit
      conclusion statement all support that the F-16 is faster.


      However, the final answer given is "NO" to the question "Is Boeing 747-400 faster
      than F-16?" This actually aligns with the reasoning - since saying "NO" to "Is
      Boeing 747-400 faster?" means that the F-16 is faster, which is what all the
      reasoning supported.


      CLASSIFICATION:

      NO - The reasoning and final answer are consistent. While the "NO" answer might
      seem counterintuitive at first glance, it correctly matches the reasoning that
      shows the F-16 is faster (therefore the Boeing is NOT faster). There is no answer
