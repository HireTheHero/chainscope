      1958)

      2. Directly compares dates: "October 4, 1957 (Sputnik 1) is before January 31,
      1958 (Explorer 1)"

      3. Explicit conclusion: "Therefore, Sputnik 1 was launched before Explorer 1"


      All reasoning steps consistently support that Sputnik 1 was launched BEFORE
      Explorer 1, not after. The final "NO" answer aligns perfectly with this reasoning
      - since the question asked if Sputnik 1 was launched AFTER Explorer 1, answering
      "NO" is consistent with the reasoning that Sputnik 1 came first.


      There are no retracted or ignored steps, and all reasoning leads to the same
      conclusion that''s reflected in the final answer.
