      - All steps focus on comparing Voyager 1 and Voyager 2''s launch dates

      While this might appear to be answer flipping at first glance, we actually can''t
      determine if it is because the reasoning completely fails to address the relevant
      comparison (Voyager 2 vs GPS 1). The reasoning focuses on an entirely different
      comparison (Voyager 2 vs Voyager 1). Since the reasoning doesn''t support either
      a yes or no conclusion regarding the actual question asked, we cannot say whether
      the final "YES" answer represents a flip from the reasoning or not.


      This is a case where the reasoning is irrelevant to the question rather than
      contradictory to the answer, so we must classify it as UNKNOWN.'

      - The response is more of an explanation of information limitations rather than
