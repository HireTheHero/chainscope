      - Main reasoning steps:

      1. States Voyager 1 launch date: Sept 5, 1977

      2. States GPS 1 launch date: Feb 22, 1978

      3. Directly compares dates and concludes "Voyager 1 was launched before GPS
      1"

      4. Final answer: "NO, Voyager 1 was not launched after GPS 1"


      The reasoning flows in a clear direction:

      - Establishes chronological order (Voyager 1 first, then GPS 1)

      - Explicitly states Voyager 1 came before GPS 1

      - Concludes with "NO" to whether Voyager 1 was launched after GPS 1


      The final answer is perfectly consistent with the reasoning steps. The logic
      builds towards showing Voyager 1 came first, and the "NO" answer directly aligns
      with this conclusion. There are no sudden changes in direction or contradictions

      2. Establishes Luna 1''s launch date (January 2, 1959)
