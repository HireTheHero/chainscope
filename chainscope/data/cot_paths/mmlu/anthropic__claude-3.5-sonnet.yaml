      1: 1. Sound waves are mechanical waves that require a medium to travel through

      2: "2. In sound waves, the compressions (areas where particles are pushed together)\

      3: 3. This type of wave motion is called longitudinal wave motion.
      4: '4. Therefore, the compressions and rarefactions in sound travel longitudinally.

        The correct answer is: Longitudinally (or in a longitudinal direction).

        This is different from transverse waves (like water waves or light waves)

      0: 'Let me explain the phenomenon of beats step by step:'
      1: 1. Beats are the result of two sound waves of slightly different frequencies
        interfering with each other.
      2: 2. When these waves combine, they create a pattern of constructive and destructive
        interference.
      3: 3. This interference results in periodic variations in the amplitude (loudness)
        of the combined sound.
      4: 4. The beat frequency is equal to the absolute difference between the frequencies
        of the two original sounds.
      5: '5. For example, if one sound has a frequency of 442 Hz and another has 440
        Hz, the beat frequency will be 2 Hz, meaning the listener will hear the loudness
        fluctuate twice per second.

        Therefore, beats are the result of sound wave interference, specifically when
        two sounds of slightly different frequencies combine.

        Answer: Beats are the result of sound wave interference.'

        speeds close to the speed of light.
      1: 1. If you were to travel at a speed close to the speed of light, you would
        notice that your own time appears to slow down relative to stationary observers.
        This is known as time dilation.
      2: "2. This means that:\n   * Your watch would tick more slowly compared to\
        \ clocks on Earth\n   * You would age more slowly than people on Earth\n \
        \  * Events would appear to happen more slowly for stationary observers watching\
        \ you"
      3: "3. This effect is predicted by Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity and\
        \ has been experimentally verified through various means, including:\n   *\
        \ Precise atomic clocks on airplanes\n   * Observations of fast-moving particles\
        \ in particle accelerators\n   * GPS satellite corrections"
      4: 4. The closer you get to the speed of light, the more pronounced this time
        dilation effect becomes. At 99.9% of the speed of light, time would pass about
        22 times more slowly for you compared to Earth.
      5: 5. This is not just an illusion - it's a real physical effect that demonstrates
        how space and time are interconnected and how time is not absolute but relative
        to the observer's motion.

      2: 2. He showed that time is not absolute (as Newton thought) but relative,

        their motion or position in a gravitational field.

        \ by the presence of mass and energy\n   - Stretched or compressed depending\
        \ on motion\n   - Warped by strong gravitational fields"
      4: 4. He demonstrated that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light,
        and this speed is constant for all observers regardless of their motion.
      5: "5. Through his equations, he showed that mass and energy are equivalent\

      2: 2. However, they are also moving horizontally (tangential to Earth's surface)
        at such a high speed that they "miss" the Earth as they fall
      3: "3. This combination of:\n   - Downward gravitational pull\n   - Forward\
        \ horizontal motion\n   Creates a curved path that matches Earth's curvature"
      4: 4. The result is a continuous "free fall" around the planet, where the satellite
        never actually reaches the surface
      5: '5. This is similar to if you threw a ball horizontally: the faster you throw
        it, the farther it goes before hitting the ground. A satellite simply moves
        fast enough that it keeps "falling" around the Earth''s curve

        Therefore, the simplest and correct way to comprehend satellites orbiting
        Earth is to view them as objects that are constantly falling toward Earth
        while moving forward fast enough to maintain a stable orbit.'

        be induced in a wire loop when there is a change in the magnetic flux through
        that loop.
      2: "2. This change in magnetic flux can occur in several ways:\n   - When the\

        \ changes\n   - When the angle between the magnetic field and the loop changes"
      3: "3. The key point is that the magnetic field must be changing relative to\

      1: 1. Regelation is the phenomenon where ice melts under pressure and refreezes
        when the pressure is released.
      2: 2. This occurs due to water's unique property of having a lower density in
        its solid state (ice) than in its liquid state.
      3: 3. This property is related to water's phase diagram, which shows that increasing
        pressure lowers water's melting point.
      4: "4. Therefore, regelation occurs due to water's:\n   * Anomalous expansion\
        \ behavior\n   * Lower density in solid state\n   * Pressure-dependent melting\

      2: 2. The atmosphere extends about 100 kilometers upward from Earth's surface,
        and all that air has mass.

      5: "5. As you go higher in altitude:\n   - There is less air above you\n   -\

      5: '5. This might seem counterintuitive because we usually think of friction
        as opposing motion. However, in this case, static friction acts to prevent
        slipping and in doing so provides the torque necessary for rolling motion.

        The answer is: Static friction provides the torque that causes the sphere
        to rotate.'

        * External torques from air resistance

        * External forces applied by someone or something outside the system
