  - 'The question asks about the ages at death of two historical figures: Gandolfo
    Sacchi and Patriarch Michael II of Antioch. To answer the question, one would
    need specific birth and death dates for both individuals. The question is straightforward
    in that it is asking for a direct comparison between the ages of two individuals
    at the time of their deaths. The interpretation of the question is clear, as it
    does not suggest any alternative meanings or require additional context to understand
    what is being asked.'
  - 'The question asks for a comparison between the ages at death of two historical
    figures: Gandolfo Sacchi and Patriarch Michael II of Antioch. To determine if
    one died younger than the other, we need their birth and death dates to calculate
    their ages at death. This question is based on factual historical data and does
    not admit multiple interpretations; it seeks a straightforward comparison based
    on historical records.'
  - The question asks whether Gandolfo Sacchi died younger than Patriarch Michael
    II of Antioch. This is a straightforward comparison of ages at death between two
    historical figures. Assuming accurate historical records exist for both individuals'
    birth and death dates, the question admits one interpretation and one correct
    answer based on those dates. Therefore, it is not open to multiple interpretations.
  - The question asks whether Gandolfo Sacchi died younger than Patriarch Michael
    II of Antioch. To determine the answer, one would need the birth and death dates
    of both individuals. The question is clear in its intent, as it seeks a comparison
    of ages at the time of death between two specific historical figures. There is
    no ambiguity in the interpretation of the question, as it directly asks for a
    factual comparison based on historical data.
  - The question asks whether Gandolfo Sacchi died younger than Patriarch Michael
    II of Antioch, which is a comparison of their ages at death. This is a straightforward
    factual question assuming that there is historical data available for both individuals'
    ages at death. The question does not seem to admit multiple interpretations; it
    is asking for a specific comparison between two known historical figures based
    on their ages at death.
  - The question asks for a comparison of the ages at which two historical figures,
    Gandolfo Sacchi and Patriarch Michael II of Antioch, died. This question can be
    considered clear because it seeks a specific factual comparison based on historical
    records. Assuming accurate historical data is available for the ages at death
    of both individuals, the question admits only one correct answer. There is no
    indication of multiple interpretations or ambiguities in the phrasing of the question
    itself.
  - 'The question is asking for a comparison of the ages at death of two historical
    figures: Gandolfo Sacchi and Patriarch Michael II of Antioch. To determine if
    the question is clear or ambiguous, we need to consider the available historical
    records for both individuals. If the birth and death years for both figures are
    well-documented and undisputed, the question is clear because it admits one interpretation
    and one correct answer based on those records. However, if there is uncertainty
    or lack of consensus about the dates of birth or death for either of the figures,
    the question becomes ambiguous as it could lead to different interpretations and
    answers. Historical records can sometimes be incomplete or contradictory, especially
    for figures from distant pasts. Thus, without specific information on the availability
    and reliability of these dates, there is potential for ambiguity.'
  - The question asks about the ages at death of two historical figures, Gandolfo
    Sacchi and Patriarch Michael II of Antioch, and whether Gandolfo Sacchi died younger.
    The question is specific and factual, requiring historical data to determine the
    ages at which each individual died. There is no indication of multiple interpretations
    for this question, as it is a straightforward comparison of ages at death.
  - This question is AMBIGUOUS because it requires specific historical knowledge of
    the lifespans of two historical figures, Gandolfo Sacchi and Patriarch Michael
    II of Antioch. The question assumes that the reader knows or can easily find the
    birth and death dates of both individuals, which is not necessarily the case.
    Moreover, if historical records are incomplete or disputed, this could lead to
    different interpretations of the data and consequently different answers.
  - 'The question compares the ages at death of two historical figures: Gandolfo Sacchi
    and Patriarch Michael II of Antioch. To determine if the question is clear or
    ambiguous, we must consider whether there is a single interpretation of the ages
    at which these individuals died. If there are well-documented birth and death
    dates for both figures, the question is clear as it can be answered with factual
    data. However, if there are uncertainties or variations in historical records
    regarding their birth or death dates, the question could be ambiguous as it might
    lead to different interpretations and answers. Given that the question does not
    specify any particular context or source for these figures'' life spans, there
    could be ambiguity depending on the historical records available.'

  - 'The question asks for a comparison of the ages at death of two historical figures:
    Friedrich Gren and Theodora Komnene Angelina. To determine whether the question

    Firstly, Friedrich Gren was a German chemist who lived from 1760 to 1798, which
    means he died at the age of 38. Theodora Komnene Angelina was a Byzantine princess
    who lived in the 12th century, but historical records often lack precise birth

    the question.


    Therefore, due to the potential lack of clear historical data regarding Theodora''s
    age at death, the question admits more than one interpretation and is considered
    ambiguous.'
  - The question asks whether Friedrich Gren died younger than Theodora Komnene Angelina.
    To determine if the question is clear or ambiguous, we must consider the available
    historical data for both individuals. Friedrich Gren, a German chemist, lived

    during the 12th and early 13th centuries, but her exact birth and death dates
    are not well-documented. The ambiguity arises from the uncertain historical records
    regarding Theodora's age at death. Without precise information on her lifespan,
    the question admits more than one interpretation, as different sources might provide
    varying estimates of her age at death. This uncertainty in historical records
    makes it difficult to provide a definitive answer to the question.
  - The question asks for a comparison of the ages at which two historical figures,
    Friedrich Gren and Theodora Komnene Angelina, died. This requires specific historical
    data about the birth and death dates of both individuals. The interpretation hinges

    lack of specificity means the question could be interpreted in more than one way,
    leading to different answers depending on which Theodora is considered.
  - The question asks whether Friedrich Gren died at a younger age than Theodora Komnene
    Angelina. To answer this question, one would need to know the birth and death

  - The question asks whether John II, Count of Ziegenhain, died younger than Dymitr
    Aba. To answer this, one must know the ages at death of both individuals. However,
    the question doesn't provide specific dates of birth or death for either figure,
    nor does it specify which historical records or interpretations to use, as historical
    records can sometimes vary. Additionally, the historical context and availability
    of records for these figures could lead to different interpretations of their
    ages. Thus, the question can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the
    sources used for their birth and death dates.

  - The question asks whether William II, Count of Chalon, died at a younger age than
    Anastasia of Sirmium. To answer this, we need to know the ages at death of both
    historical figures. However, the question does not specify the birth or death
    years of either individual. Additionally, historical records for figures like
    Anastasia of Sirmium, who is a more obscure saint, might not be precise or widely
    agreed upon. This lack of specificity and potential variability in historical
    data makes the question ambiguous, as different interpretations of available historical
    data could lead to different answers.
  - 'The question asks whether William II, Count of Chalon, died at a younger age
    than Anastasia of Sirmium. To determine if the question is clear or ambiguous,
    we need to consider whether there is a definitive way to compare their ages at
    death.


    William II, Count of Chalon, was a historical figure with a known date of death,
    which is typically documented in historical records. Anastasia of Sirmium, however,
    is a more ancient figure, and historical records from that period may not be as
    precise or reliable. The question assumes that both figures have clear and accurate
    records of their ages at death, but this may not be the case, especially for figures
    from antiquity like Anastasia of Sirmium.


    The ambiguity arises from the potential lack of precise historical data for Anastasia
    of Sirmium''s age at death, making it difficult to provide a definitive answer.
    Without reliable historical records for both individuals, the question cannot
    be conclusively answered, leading to multiple interpretations based on varying
    historical sources.


    Therefore, the question is ambiguous because it relies on potentially unclear
    historical data, which could lead to different answers depending on the sources
    consulted.'

  - This question is AMBIGUOUS because there is no widely recognized historical figure
    known as "Princess Yangguo." This could be a misspelling or misunderstanding of
    a historical figure's name, leading to multiple interpretations. Without a clear
    identification of "Princess Yangguo," it's impossible to provide a definitive
    answer or compare her age at death to that of Blanche de France, whose historical

    at death of two historical figures. However, it could be ambiguous due to potential
    issues such as multiple individuals with similar names (e.g., there could be more
    than one Yury of Smolensk or Elizabeth le Despenser in history) or uncertainty
    regarding the exact birth and death dates of these figures. Without precise information
    about which specific individuals the question refers to, it might lead to different
    interpretations and answers.
  - 'The question asks whether Yury of Smolensk died at a younger age than Elizabeth
    le Despenser. To determine this, one needs to know the birth and death dates of
    both historical figures to compare their ages at death. The question is specific
    and only admits one interpretation: comparing the ages at death of these two individuals.
    Therefore, it does not present multiple interpretations and leads to a single
    correct answer based on historical data.'
  - The question asks whether Yury of Smolensk died younger than Elizabeth le Despenser.
    However, without specific birth and death years provided for both individuals,
    this question can be considered ambiguous. Historical records may have differing
    information about these figures, and without more context, the answer could vary.
    Additionally, the phrasing "younger" could be interpreted in terms of age at death
    or relative historical timelines. Therefore, this question admits more than one
    interpretation, which could lead to different answers depending on available historical
    data.
  - 'The question is asking for a comparison of the ages at death of two historical
    figures: Yury of Smolensk and Elizabeth le Despenser. The question seems straightforward
    as it only requires finding the ages at which both individuals died and comparing
    them. However, the ambiguity arises from the fact that historical records might
    not be precise or available for both figures. Different historical sources might
    have varying accounts of their birth and death years, leading to different interpretations
    of their ages at death. Therefore, the question could lead to different answers
    depending on the sources used.'
  - The question asks whether Yury of Smolensk died younger than Elizabeth le Despenser,
    which seems straightforward. However, the ambiguity arises from the lack of specific
    historical information provided in the question itself. Without exact birth and
    death dates for both historical figures, the question can lead to different interpretations
    depending on the source of historical data. Additionally, the names might refer
    to different individuals if not specified clearly, adding to the ambiguity.
  - The question asks whether Yury of Smolensk died at a younger age than Elizabeth
    le Despenser. To answer this, one would need the birth and death dates of both
    historical figures to calculate their ages at death. However, the question does
    not specify which Yury of Smolensk is being referred to, as there could be multiple
    historical figures with this name. Additionally, there might be ambiguity regarding
    the exact birth and death dates of these historical figures, depending on historical
    records. Thus, the question admits more than one interpretation depending on which
    historical figures and dates are considered.

    correct answer based on that data. The question does not present multiple interpretations,
    as it simply requires factual information about the ages at death of these two
    individuals.
  - 'The question asks for a comparison of the ages at death between two historical
    figures, Werner Schaler and Heinrich von Besmedin. The question is straightforward
    in that it is seeking a factual answer based on historical data regarding their
    ages at death. However, the potential issue arises from the fact that these figures
    may not be well-known or easily researched, which could lead to difficulty in
    providing a precise answer. Despite this, the question itself is clear in what
    it is asking: a simple comparison of ages at death. The interpretation does not
    change, and it does not admit multiple interpretations of what is being asked.'
  - 'The question is asking for a comparison of the ages at which two historical figures,
    Werner Schaler and Heinrich von Besmedin, died. To answer this question, one needs
    specific information about the ages or dates of death of both individuals. The
    question itself is straightforward and only has one interpretation: determining
    whether Werner Schaler died at a younger age than Heinrich von Besmedin. However,
    the ambiguity arises from the fact that the question assumes knowledge about these
    specific historical figures, who may not be well-known or well-documented. Without
    clear historical records or information about these individuals, it might be impossible
    to provide an answer. Despite this potential information gap, the question itself
    is clear in its intent.'
  - The question asks whether Werner Schaler died younger than Heinrich von Besmedin.
    For the question to be clear, it requires that both historical figures are well-documented
    with known birth and death dates. If these details are known and verified, the
    question is clear as it admits one interpretation and one correct answer based
    on the factual data. However, if either of these figures is obscure or lacks concrete
    historical records regarding their birth or death dates, the question could be
    ambiguous as it would rely on uncertain or disputed historical information. Without
    additional context or confirmation of the figures' historical details, the question
    can be considered ambiguous due to potential variability in the historical record.

    However, without additional context or information on these individuals, it is
    unclear if they are well-known historical figures, fictional characters, or lesser-known
    individuals. This lack of context makes it difficult to determine if the question
    is asking about real historical figures or if it could be interpreted differently
    based on available information or assumptions. Therefore, the question admits
    more than one interpretation regarding the identities of Werner Schaler and Heinrich

  - The question asks for a comparison of ages at death between two historical figures,
    Werner Schaler and Heinrich von Besmedin. To determine whether the question is
    clear or ambiguous, we need to consider whether the identities and death ages
    of both individuals are well-defined and commonly agreed upon. If these figures
    are not widely recognized or if there is limited or conflicting historical information
    about their ages at death, the question could be ambiguous. However, if both individuals
    are well-documented and their death ages are established, the question would be
    clear. Given that these names are not widely known historical figures, there might
    be ambiguity in identifying them and their respective ages at death.
  - The question asks whether Werner Schaler died at a younger age than Heinrich von
    Besmedin. For this question to be clear, specific and unambiguous information
    about the birth and death dates of both individuals is required. However, the
    ambiguity arises because the historical records of Werner Schaler and Heinrich
    von Besmedin may not be widely known or available, and the question assumes that
    both figures are well-documented enough to make this comparison. Without such
    context or clarification on who these individuals are, the question is open to
    interpretation and lacks a definitive answer based solely on the information provided.

  - The question asks whether William III de Cantilupe died younger than Antonio Arcioni.
    However, without specific birth and death dates for both individuals, this question
    could be interpreted in multiple ways. The ambiguity arises from potential uncertainties
    or variations in historical records regarding their birth and death years. Additionally,
    if there are multiple historical figures with similar names, this could further
    complicate the interpretation. Therefore, without clear historical data provided
    within the question, it remains open to different interpretations.
  - The question asks whether William III de Cantilupe died younger than Antonio Arcioni.
    To answer this question, we need specific information about the ages at which
    both individuals died. This seems straightforward, but the ambiguity arises from
    the lack of context or widely known information about these specific historical
    figures. Both names are not prominent historical figures, so unless the reader
    has access to detailed historical records or data about these individuals, the
    question remains open to interpretation. Additionally, if there are multiple individuals
    with the same names across different historical periods, this could further complicate
    the answer. Therefore, the question could be interpreted differently depending
    on which William III de Cantilupe or Antonio Arcioni is being referenced.

  - The question asks whether William III de Cantilupe died at a younger age than
    Antonio Arcioni. To determine if this is CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS, we need to consider
    the information available about these historical figures. If both individuals
    have well-documented birth and death dates, the question is likely clear because
    it asks for a straightforward comparison of ages at death. However, if the birth
    or death dates of either individual are uncertain or disputed, the question becomes

  - The question is asking for a comparison between the ages at death of two historical
    figures, William III de Cantilupe and Antonio Arcioni. To determine if the question
    is clear, we need to consider if there is only one possible interpretation and
    answer. The question presumes that the dates of birth and death for both individuals
    are available and undisputed. However, if there is uncertainty or lack of consensus
    about the birth or death dates of either figure, this could lead to different
    interpretations and answers. Without additional context or universally accepted
    historical records, the question can be seen as ambiguous because the answer depends
    on specific historical data that may not be clearly established or agreed upon.
  - The question is asking for a comparison of the ages at death of two historical
    figures, William III de Cantilupe and Antonio Arcioni. To determine if the question
    is clear or ambiguous, we need to consider whether the identities and death ages
    of both individuals are well-documented and singularly interpretable. If historical
    records clearly define the ages at which both figures died, then the question
    would be clear. However, if there are multiple historical figures with the same
    names or if the records of their ages at death are inconsistent or disputed, the
    question would be ambiguous. Given that lesser-known historical figures might
    have less well-documented histories, this question could lead to ambiguity if
    the ages at death are not definitively recorded or if there is any confusion about
    which individuals are being referred to.
  - The question asks whether William III de Cantilupe died at a younger age than
    Antonio Arcioni. To determine if this question is clear or ambiguous, we must
    consider whether there is a single way to interpret the ages and death dates of
    these historical figures. The question is clear in that it is asking for a direct
    comparison of ages at death, assuming the dates of birth and death for both individuals
    are known. There is no alternate interpretation of what is being asked; it is
    simply a factual comparison based on historical records.

  - The question asks whether Otto III von Rietberg died at a younger age than Adalbero
    von Augsburg. To determine the answer, one would need to know the ages at death
    of both historical figures. However, the question is precise in its request for
    a comparison of ages at death, and it does not admit multiple interpretations.
    Therefore, it can be answered definitively if the necessary historical data is
    available.
  - The question is asking whether Otto III von Rietberg died at a younger age than
    Adalbero von Augsburg. To answer this question, we need specific historical information
    about the ages at which both Otto III von Rietberg and Adalbero von Augsburg died.
    The question assumes that these figures are well-defined and distinct, and it
    compares their ages at the time of death. There is only one interpretation of
    the question, which is a straightforward comparison of ages, assuming the historical
    records provide clear dates of birth and death for both individuals.
  - The question asks whether Otto III von Rietberg died younger than Adalbero von
    Augsburg. To determine if the question is clear or ambiguous, we must consider
    whether there is only one way to interpret the ages and death dates of the two
    historical figures. The question assumes that there is definitive historical data
    available regarding the birth and death dates of both individuals. If these dates
    are well-documented and agreed upon by historians, the question would be clear,
    as it would admit one interpretation with a single correct answer based on historical
    records. However, if there is uncertainty or debate among historians about these
    dates, the question could be considered ambiguous. Without additional context
    or specific knowledge of the historical records of these figures, it is difficult
    to determine the clarity of the question. However, given the nature of historical
    records, it is possible that interpretations could vary.
  - The question asks whether Otto III von Rietberg died younger than Adalbero von
    Augsburg. This question is potentially ambiguous due to the lack of specific dates
    or context regarding the two historical figures. Without precise birth and death
    dates or additional context, the interpretation of "younger" could vary. Moreover,
    there might be multiple historical figures with similar names, leading to different
    interpretations of who exactly is being referred to. Thus, the question admits
    more than one interpretation, which could lead to different answers.
  - 'The question asks whether Otto III von Rietberg died at a younger age than Adalbero
    von Augsburg. To determine if the question is clear or ambiguous, we need to consider
    the following:

    - The question provides specific names of historical figures, which implies a
    direct comparison of their ages at death.

    - For the question to be clear, both individuals must be identifiable historical
    figures with known birth and death dates.

    - If there is historical consensus on these dates, the question is clear as it
    would admit only one correct answer based on factual information.

    - However, if there are multiple historical figures with similar names or if their
    birth/death dates are disputed or unknown, this could lead to ambiguity.


    Assuming the historical figures are well-documented and there is a consensus on
    their birth and death dates, the question would be classified as clear. However,
    without additional context, such as confirmation of their identities and the availability
    of precise dates, there is potential for ambiguity. Given the lack of specific
    context in the question itself, it could be interpreted as ambiguous if there
    is any uncertainty about the historical details.'
  - The question asks if Otto III von Rietberg died younger than Adalbero von Augsburg.

    question that can be answered with historical data on their respective ages at
    death.
  - The question asks whether Otto III von Rietberg died younger than Adalbero von
    Augsburg. To answer this question, one would need to know the ages at which both

    two specific individuals.
  - The question asks whether Otto III von Rietberg died at a younger age than Adalbero
    von Augsburg. The question is asking for a comparison of ages at the time of death
    between two historical figures. The names specified are clear, and the question
    is focused on a specific aspect (age at death) of these figures. Assuming the
    historical records provide clear dates of birth and death for both individuals,
    the question admits only one interpretation and one correct answer based on those
    records. Therefore, the question does not appear to have multiple interpretations
    that could lead to different answers.
