    of these locations, the question may not have a definitive answer.'
  - The question asks about the relative location of two specific places, Heartland,
    TX and Standing Pine, MS. The interpretation depends on whether "Heartland, TX"

    specific coordinates or a recognized city named Heartland, TX, determining its
    position relative to Standing Pine, MS is not straightforward. This leads to multiple
    interpretations and potential answers based on different assumptions about what
    is meant by "Heartland, TX."
