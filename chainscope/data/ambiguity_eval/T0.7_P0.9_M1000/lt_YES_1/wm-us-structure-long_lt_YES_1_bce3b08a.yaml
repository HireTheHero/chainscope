  - The question asks whether New York City Center is located west of Ziegfeld Theatre
    in New York. This question could be considered ambiguous because it depends on
    the specific definitions of "west" and the reference points being used. In a city
    like New York, where the street grid can cause different interpretations of cardinal
    directions, "west" might be interpreted differently. Additionally, without precise
    addresses or coordinates, determining which location is west of the other could
    lead to different answers. Thus, the question could have more than one interpretation
    based on these factors.

    city center\" might not be a specific building but rather the central area of\
    \ New York City, which could be interpreted differently. However, if interpreted\
    \ as a specific building like \"New York City Center,\" this reduces ambiguity.\n\
    \   \n2. \"Ziegfeld Theatre (1927)\" could refer to the historical location of\
    \ the theater that existed at that time, which has since been demolished. There\
    \ have been multiple theaters with the Ziegfeld name, and the question does not\
    \ specify which one. \n\nThese interpretations can lead to different answers regarding\
    \ their relative locations, thus making the question ambiguous."

    is specific about the locations involved and what is being asked (the relative
    westward position of Mammy''s Cupboard in relation to Lake Onalaska). There is
    only one correct interpretation of the question: determining the longitudinal
    positions of the two locations to answer whether one is west of the other.'
  - The question is asking about the geographic location of Mammy's Cupboard in relation
    to Lake Onalaska. However, there is ambiguity in the question because "Lake Onalaska,
    MN" does not exist. Lake Onalaska is actually located in Wisconsin, not Minnesota.
    This discrepancy in location could lead to different interpretations of what the
    question is actually asking, as one might assume a different Lake Onalaska could
    exist in Minnesota. Therefore, the question is ambiguous due to the incorrect
    state designation and potential for misunderstanding the geographic reference.
  - The question is asking about the geographical location of Mammy's Cupboard in
    relation to Lake Onalaska. However, there is ambiguity in the question due to
    the mention of Lake Onalaska, MN. Lake Onalaska is typically associated with Wisconsin,
    not Minnesota. This could lead to confusion about which Lake Onalaska is being
    referenced, if any. Additionally, Mammy's Cupboard is a specific location in Mississippi
    (MS), so the question might be intended to assess the relative location of these
    places, but the ambiguity regarding Lake Onalaska's correct state location makes
    it difficult to provide a definitive answer.
  - The question asks whether Mammy's Cupboard in Mississippi is located west of Lake
    Onalaska in Minnesota. This question involves geographic locations and can be
    answered by determining the relative positions of these two specific places on
    a map. Since there is a single geographic interpretation and only one correct
    answer based on their positions, the question is clear.
  - The question asks about the geographical location of Mammy's Cupboard in relation
    to Lake Onalaska. The state abbreviations MS and MN are used, which refer to Mississippi
    and Minnesota, respectively. The question seems to assume that Lake Onalaska is
    in Minnesota, but there is a Lake Onalaska in Wisconsin, which could lead to confusion.
    Additionally, the use of "west of" can be interpreted in terms of geographic direction
    or proximity. Thus, the question could have multiple interpretations depending
    on the location of Lake Onalaska being considered and the interpretation of "west
    of."
  - 'The question is asking whether Mammy''s Cupboard in Mississippi (MS) is located
    west of Lake Onalaska in Minnesota (MN). The question is straightforward, as it
    involves a geographical comparison of two specific locations: Mammy''s Cupboard

    here is to determine the relative westward position of Mammy''s Cupboard in relation
    to Lake Onalaska. There is no ambiguity in the phrasing or potential for multiple
    interpretations, as it clearly asks for a directional comparison between two fixed
    points.'
  - The question is asking about the location of Mammy's Cupboard in relation to Lake
    Onalaska. However, there is ambiguity due to the mention of "Lake Onalaska, MN,"
    as Lake Onalaska is actually located on the Mississippi River, forming the border
    between Wisconsin and Minnesota, near the city of Onalaska, WI. The question's
    phrasing could lead to confusion about the intended location of Lake Onalaska.
    Thus, the question could be interpreted differently depending on the understanding
    of Lake Onalaska's location.
  - The question asks if Mammy's Cupboard, which is in Mississippi (MS), is located
    west of Lake Onalaska, which is stated to be in Minnesota (MN). However, Lake
    Onalaska is actually located on the border between Wisconsin (WI) and Minnesota
    (MN), which could cause confusion about which state the lake is primarily associated
    with. The question assumes Lake Onalaska is solely in Minnesota, which is not

    NY" and "Park Performing Arts Center, NJ" must be well-defined and recognized
    locations. However, "Big Pink, NY" is not a widely recognized or specific landmark
    without additional context. It could refer to different places or structures,
    leading to ambiguity in determining its location relative to the Park Performing
    Arts Center. Without more context, this question admits multiple interpretations
    and could lead to different answers depending on the assumed location of "Big
    Pink, NY."
  - The question asks if a specific structure named "Big Pink, NY" is located west
    of "Park Performing Arts Center, NJ." The ambiguity arises from the lack of precise
    locations for "Big Pink, NY" and the "Park Performing Arts Center, NJ." Without
    clear definitions or widely recognized locations for these names, there could
    be multiple interpretations of what "Big Pink, NY" refers to and its exact location.
    This leads to potential different answers depending on how one interprets "Big
    Pink, NY." Furthermore, the question doesn't specify the criteria or scale (e.g.,
    city, state) for determining "west," adding another layer of ambiguity.
  - The question asks about the relative location of "Big Pink, NY" in relation to
    "Park Performing Arts Center, NJ." The ambiguity arises because "Big Pink" is

    phrasing "located west of" could imply different points of reference depending
    on the specific locations within New York and New Jersey being considered. Without
    more specific information about what "Big Pink" refers to, the question is ambiguous.
  - The question asks whether a specific location, "Big Pink, NY," is located west
    of another specific location, "Park Performing Arts Center, NJ." However, the
    question is ambiguous because "Big Pink, NY" is not a well-known or clearly defined
    location. Without additional context or information to specify what "Big Pink"
    refers to, it's impossible to determine its geographical position relative to
    the Park Performing Arts Center in New Jersey. This lack of clarity leads to multiple
    potential interpretations and thus, different answers.
  - The question asks about the relative location of "Big Pink, NY" and "Park Performing
    Arts Center, NJ." The ambiguity arises because "Big Pink, NY" is not a widely
    recognized or specific landmark or structure, which means it could refer to multiple
    places or be fictional. Without a clear definition or recognition of "Big Pink,
    NY," the question is open to multiple interpretations about what or where "Big
    Pink" might be, leading to different possible answers.
  - 'The question involves the geographic locations of two structures: "Big Pink,
    NY" and "Park Performing Arts Center, NJ." The question asks if one is located
    west of the other. For this to be a clear question, both structures need to be
    well-defined and identifiable locations. However, "Big Pink, NY" is not a widely
    recognized landmark or structure, which could lead to ambiguity. Without a clear
    understanding or agreement on what "Big Pink, NY" refers to, the question admits
    more than one interpretation, as different people may have different ideas about
    what "Big Pink" is or where it is located. This lack of specificity makes it difficult
    to provide a single, definitive answer about their geographic relationship.'
  - The question asks if "Big Pink, NY" is located west of "Park Performing Arts Center,
    NJ." This question is ambiguous because "Big Pink, NY" is not a widely recognized

    to determine the exact location being referred to, leading to potential multiple
    interpretations and answers.
