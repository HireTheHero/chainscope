  - 'The question asks if the Great Wall of China, specifically from the Ming Dynasty
    period, was completed before the Taj Mahal. The Great Wall of China''s Ming Dynasty
    construction primarily took place during the 14th to 17th centuries, while the

    asking for a comparison of completion dates between two historical constructions,
    and this comparison has a factual answer based on historical records.'
  - 'The question is asking about the completion dates of two historical structures:
    the Great Wall of China during the Ming Dynasty and the Taj Mahal. The Great Wall
    of China was constructed over many dynasties, but significant work was done during
    the Ming Dynasty, which lasted from 1368 to 1644. The Taj Mahal was completed
    in 1643. Therefore, the question is comparing the timeframe of the Ming Dynasty
    with the specific completion date of the Taj Mahal, which allows for only one
    interpretation regarding the historical timeline.'
  - "The question asks whether the Great Wall of China, specifically the Ming Dynasty\
    \ section, was completed before the Taj Mahal. This can be interpreted in two\
    \ ways: \n\n1. Whether the construction of the Ming Dynasty section of the Great\
    \ Wall was completed before the construction of the Taj Mahal began.\n2. Whether\
    \ the construction of the Ming Dynasty section of the Great Wall was completed\
    \ before the Taj Mahal was completed.\n\nThe Ming Dynasty section of the Great\
    \ Wall was built between the 14th and 17th centuries, while the Taj Mahal was\
    \ constructed between 1632 and 1643. Depending on the interpretation, the answer\
    \ could differ, making the question ambiguous."
  - 'The question is asking about the completion dates of two historical structures:
    the Great Wall of China during the Ming Dynasty and the Taj Mahal. The Great Wall
    of China was built over several centuries, with significant construction during
    the Ming Dynasty from the 14th to 17th centuries. The Taj Mahal was completed
    in 1643. The question can be interpreted as asking if the Ming Dynasty section
    of the Great Wall was completed before the completion of the Taj Mahal. Given
    the specific historical context and construction timelines, the question is relatively
    clear if focusing on the significant works of the Ming Dynasty period of the Great
    Wall compared to the completion of the Taj Mahal.'
  - The question asks whether the completion of the Great Wall of China during the
    Ming Dynasty occurred before the completion of the Taj Mahal. The Great Wall of
    China has sections built at various times, but the question specifies the Ming
    Dynasty period, which provides a clear time frame. The Ming Dynasty lasted from
    1368 to 1644, and the Taj Mahal was completed in 1643. This allows for a direct
    comparison of time frames, making the question clear in its intent and answerable
    with historical facts.
  - The question asks whether the Great Wall of China, specifically the sections completed
    during the Ming Dynasty, was completed before the Taj Mahal. This question has
    a clear historical context. The Ming Dynasty's construction of the Great Wall
    primarily took place from 1368 to 1644. The Taj Mahal's construction began in
    1632 and was completed in 1643. Since the question specifies the Ming Dynasty,
    which has well-documented timelines, it admits only one interpretation and one
    correct answer based on historical records.
  - The question asks whether the Great Wall of China, specifically during the Ming
    Dynasty, was completed before the Taj Mahal. The Great Wall of China, in its various
    forms, was built and rebuilt over several dynasties, but the most well-known sections
    were indeed constructed during the Ming Dynasty, completed by the early 17th century.

    has a clear historical context and timeline, admitting only one correct interpretation
    and answer.
  - The question asks whether the construction of the Great Wall of China during the
    Ming Dynasty was completed before the Taj Mahal. This question can be interpreted
    in a straightforward manner by comparing the timeline of the two constructions.
    The Great Wall of China, specifically during the Ming Dynasty, was completed in
    the 17th century. The Taj Mahal, on the other hand, was completed in 1643. Since
    the Ming Dynasty's work on the Great Wall continued until 1644, this means that
    the construction of the Great Wall during the Ming Dynasty was not completed before
    the Taj Mahal. Therefore, the question can be answered with a clear timeline comparison.
  - The question asks if the Great Wall of China, specifically the portion completed
    during the Ming Dynasty, was finished before the Taj Mahal. The Great Wall has
    sections built over many dynasties, with the Ming Dynasty's contributions occurring
    between the 14th and 17th centuries. The Taj Mahal was completed in 1643. The
    question can be interpreted in a straightforward manner by comparing the end of
    the Ming Dynasty's work on the Great Wall with the completion date of the Taj
    Mahal. There is no ambiguity in the question as it provides clear historical events
    to compare, leading to one interpretation and answer.
  - 'The question is asking about the completion dates of two historical structures:
    the Great Wall of China during the Ming Dynasty and the Taj Mahal. The Great Wall
    of China was primarily built and reconstructed during the Ming Dynasty, which
    lasted from 1368 to 1644. The Taj Mahal was completed in 1643. The question can
    be interpreted as comparing the completion of the entire Ming Dynasty reconstruction
    of the Great Wall with the completion date of the Taj Mahal. Given these dates,
    the Great Wall''s construction during the Ming Dynasty was indeed completed before
    the Taj Mahal. There is only one interpretation that leads to a specific answer,
    making the question clear.'
