  - 'The question "Is Sarmada located west of Loiyangalani?" asks for a geographical
    relationship between two specific locations: Sarmada and Loiyangalani. This query
    is straightforward in that it seeks a simple directional answer based on geographical
    coordinates or a map. There is only one correct answer to whether one location
    is west of the other, assuming the locations are correctly identified. Therefore,
    the question does not present multiple interpretations and should be considered
    clear.'
  - The question asks whether Sarmada is located west of Loiyangalani. This could
    be interpreted in different ways due to the lack of specific context or reference
    points. "West" is a relative direction, and without knowing the specific locations
    or coordinates of Sarmada and Loiyangalani, different interpretations could arise.
    Additionally, the question does not specify whether the consideration is geographical,
    cultural, or based on any other criteria that might influence the interpretation
    of "west." Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation, which
    could lead to different answers depending on the context or source of geographical
    information used.
  - The question is asking about the relative geographic location of Sarmada in relation
    to Loiyangalani. The terms "west" and the specific place names are clear and direct,
    suggesting that the question seeks a factual answer based on geographic coordinates.
    However, the ambiguity arises from the lack of context or reference for how one
    might interpret "west" (e.g., along a specific line of latitude, or based on a
    specific map projection). Additionally, without more context on which Sarmada
    or Loiyangalani is being referred to, given that there might be places with similar
    names, the question can be open to interpretation. Therefore, due to potential
    differences in interpretation regarding the criteria or reference for determining
    "west," the question admits more than one interpretation.
  - The question asks if Sarmada is located west of Loiyangalani, which seems straightforward.
    However, it is ambiguous because it does not specify which Sarmada is being referred
    to, as there could be multiple places with the same name. Additionally, without
    knowing the specific locations being referenced, the relative position (west)
    could be interpreted differently. Thus, the question can lead to different answers
    depending on the interpretation of the locations involved.
  - The question asks whether Sarmada is located west of Loiyangalani. For this question
    to be clear, the locations of both Sarmada and Loiyangalani must be well-defined
    and unambiguous, allowing for a straightforward geographical comparison. However,
    the question does not specify which Sarmada is being referred to, as there could
    be multiple places with the name Sarmada. Without additional context or specific
    geographical identifiers, the question could lead to different interpretations
    depending on which Sarmada is considered. Therefore, the question is ambiguous.
  - The question asks whether Sarmada is located west of Loiyangalani. The question
    seems straightforward, but it can be considered ambiguous for a couple of reasons.
    First, the question assumes that the locations of Sarmada and Loiyangalani are
    known and identifiable, which may not be the case for all respondents. Second,
    there might be multiple places named Sarmada or Loiyangalani, leading to different
    interpretations depending on which locations are considered. Without additional
    context specifying which Sarmada and Loiyangalani are being referred to, the question
    can admit more than one interpretation.
  - The question asks about the geographical location of Sarmada in relation to Loiyangalani,
    specifically whether Sarmada is located to the west of Loiyangalani. This question
    could be considered ambiguous because the answer depends on the specific locations
    of Sarmada and Loiyangalani. Without additional context or a map, there may be
    varying interpretations of what constitutes "west" due to the curvature of the
    Earth or the specific points being referenced within each location. Additionally,
    there may be multiple places with the same name, adding to the ambiguity.
  - The question asks if Sarmada is located west of Loiyangalani. The interpretation
    depends on the specific geographical locations being referred to, as there may
    be multiple places with the same name in different parts of the world. Without
    additional context specifying which Sarmada and Loiyangalani are being referred
    to, the question could have different answers depending on the locations chosen.
    Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation.
  - The question asks if Sarmada is located west of Loiyangalani. To answer this,
    we need geographical knowledge about the locations of Sarmada and Loiyangalani.
    The question is specific and seeks a factual answer based on geographical data.
    There are no multiple interpretations of the question itself; it is a straightforward
    query about relative location. Therefore, it admits only one correct answer based
    on geographical facts.
  - The question asks about the geographical location of Sarmada in relation to Loiyangalani.
    The question is clear in its intent, seeking a directional relationship between
    two specific places. However, without additional context, it might be ambiguous
    for someone unfamiliar with these locations. For those familiar with geography,
    or with access to maps, the question is straightforward and admits one correct
    interpretation based on objective geographical data.

  - The question asks whether Bhaktapur District is located west of Barajamda. The
    question is geographically specific, asking about the relative location of two
    distinct places. Bhaktapur District is in Nepal, while Barajamda is in India.
    The question is straightforward in terms of geography, as there is only one correct
    answer regarding their relative positions on a map.
  - The question asks about the relative location of Bhaktapur District in relation
    to Barajamda. This question could be considered ambiguous because it does not
    specify the context or the level of detail required. Geographically, Bhaktapur
    is in Nepal and Barajamda is in India, which could lead to different interpretations
    based on different mapping perspectives or scales. Additionally, without more
    specific geographic coordinates or a defined map projection, there might be multiple
    interpretations of "west" depending on the context or the way the map is oriented.
  - The question asks about the relative location of Bhaktapur District in relation
    to Barajamda. The question seems straightforward, asking for a geographical comparison.
    However, it could be considered ambiguous because it depends on the specific point
    of reference used for each location. Without a map or specific coordinates, the
    interpretation could vary. Additionally, if either place has multiple locations
    or is not well-known, the question may lack sufficient context to provide a clear
    answer.

    context (e.g., considering latitude/longitude lines, road networks, or specific
    cultural or political definitions), the question could lead to different interpretations.
    Furthermore, the question does not specify whether it refers to the direct west
    or a more general western direction. Hence, this lack of specificity makes the
    question open to multiple interpretations.
  - The question asks whether Bhaktapur District is located west of Barajamda. This
    question is asking about geographical locations and their relative positions.

  - The question asks if Bhaktapur District is located west of Barajamda. To answer
    this, one needs to know the geographical locations of both Bhaktapur District
    and Barajamda. Bhaktapur District is in Nepal, while Barajamda is in Jharkhand,
    India. Given this information, Bhaktapur District is indeed located to the west
    of Barajamda. The question is straightforward and does not admit multiple interpretations
    or answers.
  - 'The question asks whether Bhaktapur District is located west of Barajamda. To
    determine if this question is clear or ambiguous, we need to consider if there
    is only one interpretation. Geographically, the question is asking for a relative
    position between two locations: Bhaktapur District and Barajamda. The interpretation
    hinges on whether we can definitively state the relative positioning based on
    their geographic coordinates. Bhaktapur is in Nepal, and Barajamda is in India.
    Given their fixed locations on the map, the question can be answered with a specific
    yes or no. Therefore, the question only admits one interpretation and one correct
    answer based on geographical facts.'
  - The question asks about the geographical location of Bhaktapur District in relation
    to Barajamda. This requires a factual answer based on geographical data. The interpretation

    However, without additional context or specific coordinates, the exact determination
    could be dependent on the scale or map projection used. Despite this, the question
    fundamentally seeks a straightforward geographical fact, which does not admit
    multiple interpretations regarding what is being asked.

    specificity in the question, such as which Sahiwal District is being referred
    to, as there might be multiple places with similar names, and the exact point
    of reference in Bhivpuri is not specified. Despite this, in most contexts, the
    geographical relationship between two places is generally clear and specific,
    allowing for a definitive answer. Therefore, the question is likely intended to
    be clear, assuming common geographical understandings. However, the presence of

    or if it is generally to the west of it (but not necessarily directly west). Additionally,
    without specifying which Bhivpuri is being referred to (as there could be multiple
    places with the same name), this adds to the ambiguity. Thus, the question can
    be interpreted in multiple ways.'
  - 'The question "Is Bhivpuri located west of Sahiwal District?" is asking for a
    geographical comparison between two locations: Bhivpuri and Sahiwal District.

    known, and without additional context or a map, it might be unclear whether Bhivpuri
    is intended to refer to a specific location that the asker assumes is known. Furthermore,
    the relative positioning (west of) depends on the specific points or boundaries
    being considered, and without precise definitions, interpretations could vary.

    the relative westward position of Peper Harow in relation to Great Gonerby. Thus,
    there is only one correct answer to this question based on the fixed positions
    of these locations.'
  - The question asks whether Peper Harow is located west of Great Gonerby. This question
    is geographically specific and asks for a directional relationship between two
    places. The interpretation is straightforward as it involves determining the geographical

  - The question asks if Stepan is located west of Coligny, North West. The ambiguity
    arises from the possible interpretations of "North West." It could refer to a
    region or direction. If "North West" is meant to indicate a region or province,
    such as "North West" in South Africa, the question seeks a geographical comparison
    between two specific places. However, if "North West" is intended as a direction
    (northwest), it could imply a broader interpretation of locations. Without additional
    context clarifying the intended meaning of "North West," the question remains
    open to multiple interpretations.
  - The question is asking about the relative location of "Stepan" in relation to
    "Coligny, North West." However, without additional context, it is unclear what
    "Stepan" refers to. It could be a city, a town, a landmark, or something else
    entirely. Furthermore, "Coligny, North West" may refer to a specific place in
    a region or could be a general direction. Due to these ambiguities regarding the
    specific entities being referenced, the question can be interpreted in multiple
    ways, which could lead to different answers depending on the interpretation.
  - The question asks whether Stepan is located west of Coligny, North West. The ambiguity
    arises from the lack of specific context or information about "Stepan." Without
    additional details, it's unclear which "Stepan" is being referred to, as there
    could be multiple places or entities with that name. Additionally, "Coligny, North
    West" might refer to a specific location in a particular region or country, such
    as the North West province in South Africa. The question does not provide enough
    information to determine the exact locations being compared, leading to multiple
    possible interpretations and answers.
  - The question asks if a place called Stepan is located west of another place named
    Coligny, North West. The ambiguity arises from the fact that "Coligny, North West"
    could refer to multiple places. "Coligny" could be a town or a region, and "North
    West" could be interpreted as a cardinal direction or as part of a location name
    (such as the North West province in South Africa). Without specific context or
    geographic markers, there could be multiple interpretations of where "Coligny,
    North West" is located, thus affecting the answer to whether Stepan is west of
    it.
  - The question "Is Stepan located west of Coligny, North West?" is ambiguous. The
    ambiguity arises from the lack of specificity in the names "Stepan" and "Coligny,
    North West." Without additional context, it's unclear whether "Stepan" refers
    to a place, person, or entity, and "Coligny, North West" could refer to a town,
    a direction, or a region. Moreover, "North West" could be a cardinal direction
    or part of a larger name, such as a province or region. Due to these uncertainties,
    the question can be interpreted in multiple ways, leading to different answers
    depending on the context assumed by the reader.
  - The question asks whether a place named Stepan is located west of another place
    called Coligny, which is specified to be in the North West. However, the question
    is ambiguous because it does not provide sufficient information to determine which
    Stepan or Coligny is being referred to. There could be multiple places named Stepan
    or Coligny in different regions or countries. Additionally, "North West" could
    refer to a directional indication or a specific region, such as North West Province
    in South Africa. Without more specific context or coordinates, the question admits
    multiple interpretations and could lead to different answers.
  - The question asks about the relative geographical location of "Stepan" and "Coligny,
    North West." However, it is not clear what "Stepan" refers to, as there are multiple
    places or entities that might be named Stepan. Similarly, "Coligny, North West"
    could refer to a specific place that may not be universally recognized without
    additional context. The question could be interpreted differently based on the
    geographic or contextual knowledge of the reader, leading to different answers.
    Therefore, the question is ambiguous as it lacks specificity and context, making
    it difficult to determine a single correct answer.
  - The question asks whether Stepan is located west of Coligny, which is in the North
    West. However, the phrasing "Coligny, North West" could be interpreted in multiple
    ways. It could refer to Coligny in the North West province of South Africa, or
    it could be referring to another location with the name Coligny in a different
    "North West" context, such as a region or directional area not clearly specified.
    Without additional context or specification of which "North West" is being referenced,
    the question can lead to different interpretations and answers.
  - The question asks if "Stepan" is located west of "Coligny, North West." However,
    the question is ambiguous for several reasons. First, it is unclear what "Stepan"
    refers to; it could be a place, a person, or something else entirely. Additionally,
    "Coligny, North West" could refer to a location within the North West province
    of South Africa, or it could be interpreted differently depending on the context
    or region being referenced. Without further context, the question admits multiple
    interpretations, making it ambiguous.
  - The question is asking whether Stepan is located west of Coligny in the North
    West. However, the question does not specify what "Stepan" refers to. Without
    clarification, "Stepan" could refer to a person, a place, or an object, and there
    are no contextual clues to determine which is intended. Additionally, "Coligny,
    North West" is somewhat ambiguous without specifying if it refers to a specific
    place within a region known as "North West," such as the North West Province in
    South Africa or another area entirely. Due to these ambiguities, the question
    admits more than one interpretation, which could lead to different answers.

  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographical location of two places:
    Leknes and Lig. However, it is ambiguous for a couple of reasons. Firstly, the
    question does not specify which "Lig" is being referred to, as there could be
    multiple places with that name. Secondly, without additional context or reference,
    it is unclear which Leknes is being referred to, as there may also be multiple
    places with this name. The lack of specific information or context makes the question
    open to multiple interpretations, which could lead to different answers depending
    on the assumed locations of Leknes and Lig.'
  - The question asks whether Leknes is located west of Lig, but it doesn't specify
    the reference points or context for "west." The ambiguity arises because "west"
    can be interpreted relative to different geographic frameworks (e.g., local, regional,
    or global scales). Without additional context or specific geographic coordinates,
    it's unclear which interpretation of "west" is intended. Additionally, both Leknes
    and Lig could refer to multiple places worldwide, adding further ambiguity to
    the question.
  - The question asks whether Leknes is located west of Lig, and it requires understanding
    the geographical locations of these two places. "Leknes" is a town in Norway,
    and "Lig" could refer to several places, including a location in Italy or another
    less commonly known place. Without specifying which "Lig" is being referred to,
    the question is open to multiple interpretations, leading to different answers
    depending on which "Lig" is considered. Therefore, the question is ambiguous because
    it does not provide enough context to determine which interpretation is correct.
  - The question asks if Leknes is located west of Lig. Without additional context,
    this question is ambiguous because it relies on knowing which specific Leknes
    and Lig are being referred to. There are multiple places with similar names around
    the world, and without specifying the country or region, it is unclear which locations
    are being compared. Thus, the question admits more than one interpretation, which
    could lead to different answers depending on the specific locations being considered.
  - The question asks whether Leknes is located west of Lig. Both Leknes and Lig need
    to be identified as geographical locations to answer the question. However, without
    additional context or information about the specific locations referred to as
    Leknes and Lig, there could be multiple places with these names around the world.
    This makes it difficult to determine a single interpretation and answer without
    further clarification on which specific Leknes and Lig are being referenced.
  - The question is asking about the relative location of Leknes in relation to Lig.
    However, without specifying what "Lig" refers to (as there could be multiple places
    or contexts for "Lig"), the question admits more than one interpretation. Different
    interpretations of what "Lig" might refer to could lead to different answers regarding
    the location of Leknes relative to it.
  - The question asks whether Leknes is located west of Lig. Without additional context,
    it's unclear what "Lig" refers to, as there are multiple places around the world
    with similar names, and the question does not specify which one is intended. This
    lack of specificity means the question could be interpreted in multiple ways,
    depending on which "Lig" is being considered. Therefore, the question admits more
    than one interpretation, which could lead to different answers.
  - The question asks whether Leknes is located west of Lig. The question is ambiguous
    because it does not specify which "Lig" it is referring to, as there could be
    multiple places named Lig around the world. Without knowing the specific location
    of Lig, it is not possible to determine the relative position of Leknes. This
    lack of specificity leads to multiple possible interpretations, resulting in different
    answers depending on which Lig is considered.
  - The question asks about the relative geographical location of Leknes and Lig,
    asking if Leknes is located to the west of Lig. The question is straightforward
    in its request for a directional comparison between two places. However, the ambiguity
    arises because "Lig" is not a widely recognized place name and could refer to
    different locations depending on context. Without additional context to identify
    Lig precisely, multiple interpretations could lead to different answers regarding
    the relative positioning of Leknes and Lig.
  - The question "Is Leknes located west of Lig?" is ambiguous because it depends
    on the specific locations being referred to, and without additional context or
    information about which "Leknes" or "Lig" is being considered, the question could
    have different interpretations. Leknes could refer to a place in Norway, and Lig
    could refer to a location in Italy, but there might be other places with similar
    names. This could lead to different answers depending on the specific locations
    being considered.

    imply, depending on the specific reference points or how one interprets "west"
    (e.g., directly west, generally west). Therefore, this question could lead to
    different interpretations based on how "west" is understood and the precision
    required.
  - The question asks about the relative location of Aracati and Ammassalik Island.
    To determine if the question is clear or ambiguous, we need to consider the geographical
    positions of these two places. Aracati is a city in Brazil, and Ammassalik Island
    is located in Greenland. The question involves a straightforward geographical
    comparison between two specific locations. Since Aracati is in Brazil and Ammassalik
    Island is in Greenland, Aracati is indeed located west of Ammassalik Island. Therefore,
    the question admits one interpretation and one correct answer.
  - The question asks about the geographical location of Aracati in relation to Ammassalik
    Island. The question seems straightforward, asking for a specific directional
    relationship (west) between two geographic locations. However, without additional
    context or specific reference points, it might be unclear whether the reference
    is to a specific longitudinal direction, considering the possible variations in
    geographic interpretation. This could lead to different answers based on the criteria
    used (e.g., great circle route versus direct longitudinal comparison). Therefore,
    the question admits more than one interpretation regarding how "west" is defined
    in this context.
  - 'The question asks if Aracati is located west of Ammassalik Island. This can be
    interpreted in a straightforward manner, as it involves comparing the geographical
    locations of two specific places: Aracati and Ammassalik Island. Assuming the

    seeks to determine their relative positions in terms of longitude. Therefore,
    it admits only one interpretation and one correct answer based on geographical
    data.'
  - The question asks whether Aracati is located west of Ammassalik Island. This appears
    to be a straightforward geographical query comparing the relative positions of
    two locations. However, the question could be ambiguous if there are multiple
    places named Aracati, or if the definition of "west" is not clear (e.g., is it
    referring to a specific type of map projection or a general sense of direction?).
    Without additional context or specifications, the question could lead to different
    interpretations based on these factors.
  - The question asks whether Aracati is located west of Ammassalik Island. This question
    is geographically based and can be answered with a straightforward comparison
    of their longitudinal positions. Aracati is in Brazil, and Ammassalik Island is

    means that different interpretations of where "Sarrin" might be located could
    lead to different answers. Without a specific and well-known reference point,
    the question can be interpreted in multiple ways.
  - The question asks about the relative location of Lushoto in relation to Sarrin.
    However, the question is ambiguous because "Sarrin" could refer to multiple places
    or be a misspelling, and without specifying which location "Sarrin" refers to,
    it is unclear how to accurately determine the relative position of Lushoto. Additionally,
    without more context or specific reference points, there could be multiple interpretations
    of what is meant by "west" in this context.
  - 'The question "Is Lushoto located west of Sarrin?" is ambiguous because it assumes
    that the reader knows the specific places mentioned: Lushoto and Sarrin. However,
    "Sarrin" could refer to different places around the world, such as a village in
    Syria or potentially a misspelling or variation of another location. Without additional
    context or clarification on which "Sarrin" is being referred to, the question
    can be interpreted in multiple ways, leading to different answers based on the
    interpretation of "Sarrin." Therefore, the question does not have a single clear
    interpretation or answer.'
