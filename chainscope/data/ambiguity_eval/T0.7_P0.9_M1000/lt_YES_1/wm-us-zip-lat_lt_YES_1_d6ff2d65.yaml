    is singular, and the answer can be determined by checking the geographical coordinates
    or map of these zip codes.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 60651, IL is located south of 60622, IL.
    Zip codes are numerical postal codes used by the United States Postal Service
    to identify specific geographic areas. While they are often assigned in a roughly
    geographical manner, they are not always strictly sequential in a north-south
    or east-west order. Therefore, determining the relative location of two zip codes
    based solely on their numbers is not always possible without additional geographic
    data or a map. Thus, the question admits more than one interpretation based on
    the level of geographic knowledge assumed, and could lead to different answers
    depending on how one interprets the relationship between zip codes and their geographical
    locations.

    data. Thus, the question admits only one interpretation and one correct answer.
  - The question is asking about the relative location of two US zip codes, 60651
    and 60622, in Illinois. It seems to be a straightforward geographical query about
    whether one zip code is located south of another. However, the ambiguity arises
    from the fact that zip codes do not always follow a strict geographical order,
    and their numerical values do not necessarily correspond to specific directions
    (north, south, east, west). Therefore, while one interpretation is to check the
    geographical locations of these zip codes, another interpretation could be to
    consider other factors like postal routes or historical assignments. This could
    lead to different approaches and potentially different answers depending on the
    criteria used to determine "location."
  - The question asks whether the zip code 60651 in Illinois is located south of the
    zip code 60622 in Illinois. Zip codes are typically assigned based on geographic
    regions, and their numerical order does not necessarily correspond to geographic
    order (e.g., north to south or east to west). To answer the question accurately,
    one would need to look at a map or have knowledge of the geographic locations
    of these specific zip codes. The question does not present multiple interpretations;
    it is a straightforward query about relative geographic locations based on zip
    codes. Therefore, it can be classified as a question that admits one interpretation
    and one correct answer based on geographic data.
  - The question asks whether one specific ZIP code (60651, IL) is located south of
    another ZIP code (60622, IL). The question is clear in its geographical inquiry,
    as ZIP codes are specific numerical identifiers for regions, and their relative
    positions can be determined using geographical data. Therefore, this question
    admits only one interpretation and one correct answer based on geographical information.
  - The question asks whether the location of the zip code 60651, IL is south of 60622,
    IL. Zip codes are numerical and geographical identifiers, but they do not inherently

    mapping. However, given that zip codes often follow a geographical pattern within
    cities, the question could be interpreted in a straightforward manner by referencing
    a map or database of zip codes to determine their relative positions. Since the
    question involves specific zip codes and a clear geographic relationship (north
    vs. south), it is possible to determine a single correct answer with the appropriate
    geographic data. Therefore, the question is not open to multiple interpretations
    and admits one correct answer based on geographic information.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 60651 in Illinois is located south of the
    zip code 60622 in Illinois. This question is based on geographic location, which

  - 'The question is asking about the relative location of two zip codes in Vermont:
    05677 and 05477. Zip codes generally do not follow a strict geographical order
    (e.g., from north to south), as they are primarily designed for mail delivery
    efficiency rather than geographic location. Therefore, the question may seem clear
    in its wording, but because zip codes do not provide a straightforward geographical
    hierarchy, the interpretation of "located south of" based solely on zip code numbers
    is ambiguous. Additionally, without specific geographical data, one cannot determine
    the relative southward location of the zip codes. Thus, the question can lead

    it can lead to multiple interpretations or require external data to resolve.
  - The question asks whether one specific ZIP code in Vermont (05677) is located
    south of another ZIP code (05477). ZIP codes are primarily organized by region
    for mail delivery purposes and do not necessarily follow a strict north-to-south
    or east-to-west order geographically. Therefore, determining whether one ZIP code
    is "south" of another based solely on the ZIP code numbers can be misleading.
    Additionally, without specific geographical data or a map, there is no clear interpretation
    of the question regarding geographic location. The question admits multiple interpretations
    regarding how to determine "south" in this context, leading to potential different
    answers.

    are not necessarily assigned in a geographical order, and their numerical values
    do not directly correlate with latitude or longitude. However, the question itself
    is straightforward in its intent, asking for a simple geographical comparison.
    The potential confusion arises from a lack of understanding of how zip codes are
    assigned, but this does not make the question itself ambiguous in terms of interpretation.
    It seeks a direct geographical relationship between two specific zip codes.
  - The question is asking about the relative geographical location of two specific
    zip codes in Vermont, 05677 and 05477. It implies a comparison of their latitudinal

    two ZIP codes. However, ZIP codes do not inherently contain geographical information
    about latitude, and their numbers do not correlate with geographic locations.
    Additionally, ZIP codes are not designed to provide a direct indication of whether
    one is north or south of another. Thus, without additional context or specific
    geographic data, the question is inherently ambiguous as it can be interpreted
    in various ways (e.g., by asking for a map comparison or by using latitude data).
    Different methods of interpreting or determining "south" could lead to different
    answers.'
  - The question involves geographical locations based on U.S. zip codes, specifically
    asking if one location (87571 in New Mexico) is south of another location (37073
    in Tennessee). The question is clear in its intent to compare the latitudinal
    position of two specific zip code areas. However, zip codes themselves are not
    inherently geographical coordinates; they are numerical codes assigned for mail
    delivery purposes. Therefore, determining whether one zip code is geographically
    south of another requires an external lookup of their actual geographic coordinates
    (latitude and longitude). The question does not have multiple interpretations;
    it asks for a straightforward geographic comparison based on the location data
    corresponding to the zip codes.
  - The question asks whether the location of the zip code 87571 in New Mexico is
    south of the location of the zip code 37073 in Tennessee. This requires geographical
    knowledge of the relative positions of these two locations. Zip codes are typically
    numerical and do not inherently convey geographical positioning relative to one
    another. The question is clear in its intent and requires a specific geographical
    comparison to determine if 87571 is south of 37073.
  - The question asks if the zip code 87571, located in New Mexico, is south of the
    zip code 37073, located in Tennessee. The question is clear in its request for
    a geographic comparison based on latitude. Zip codes can be used to identify specific

    without specific knowledge of the geographic coordinates of these ZIP codes, it
    is not possible to definitively determine which one is south of the other based
    solely on their ZIP code numbers. Therefore, the question can be interpreted in
    multiple ways: one could attempt to answer based on ZIP code numbers alone or

    question ambiguous.'
  - The question asks if the location of one ZIP code (87571, NM) is south of another
    ZIP code (37073, TN). ZIP codes are numerical codes used for mail delivery and
    do not directly correspond to geographical coordinates. Therefore, the question
    is ambiguous because ZIP codes do not inherently contain information about their
    geographical location in terms of latitude and longitude. Additionally, the question
    could be interpreted in different ways, such as asking if the ZIP code itself
    is numerically smaller or if the geographic center of one ZIP code area is south
    of the other.
  - The question involves determining if one location (87571, NM) is south of another
    (37073, TN) based on zip codes. The zip codes are numerical identifiers for postal
    delivery areas and do not inherently contain geographical information about their
    relative positions north or south of each other. Therefore, interpreting the question
    as asking about geographical location based on zip codes is misleading. The question
    is ambiguous because it relies on the assumption that zip codes can be used to
    determine geographic direction, which is not accurate without additional context
    or data about the actual geographic coordinates of these zip codes.
  - "The question is asking whether the location of one zip code (87571, NM) is south\

  - The question is asking whether a specific location in New Mexico (87571) is situated
    south of a specific location in Tennessee (37073). However, the question uses
    ZIP codes as identifiers for locations. ZIP codes themselves do not provide direct
    geographical information like latitude or longitude. Furthermore, ZIP codes are
    not inherently ordered in a north-south or east-west manner. Therefore, determining
    if one location is south of another based solely on ZIP codes is not possible
    without additional geographical information. This makes the question ambiguous
    as it can be interpreted in different ways depending on how one tries to infer
    geographical data from ZIP codes.

  - The question asks whether a specific zip code in North Carolina (27505) is located
    south of another specific zip code in Arkansas (72904). Zip codes are numerical
    codes assigned to specific areas for mail delivery purposes and do not inherently
    provide geographical information, such as latitude or longitude. Therefore, using
    zip codes alone to determine geographical positions, like north or south, can
    be misleading. Additionally, zip codes are not assigned in a manner that corresponds
    to geographical north-south positions. Thus, the question is ambiguous because
    it assumes zip codes can provide geographical directional information, which they
    cannot reliably do.
  - The question asks whether the location associated with the US zip code 27505 in

    south of a specific zip code in Arkansas (72904). At first glance, it seems straightforward
    as it involves determining the geographical location of two fixed points. However,
    the question relies on comparing two zip codes, which are not inherently indicative
    of geographical directions such as "south" or "north." Zip codes are primarily
    for postal delivery and do not follow a geographical order. Therefore, the interpretation
    could involve actual geographical latitude, but zip codes themselves do not provide
    enough information to determine this. The question is ambiguous because it is
    not clear whether it refers to the latitude (geographical north-south position)

  - The question asks whether a specific location in Ohio, identified by the ZIP code
    44483, is located south of another location in Illinois, identified by the ZIP
    code 60408. ZIP codes are numerical representations that typically increase from
    east to west across the United States, but they do not inherently provide information
    about latitude or north-south positioning. Therefore, to determine if one location
    is south of another, one must refer to geographic coordinates or maps rather than
    ZIP codes. The question is clear in its request to compare the relative geographic
    positions of two specific locations based on latitude.
  - 'The question is asking if one location, identified by the zip code 44483 in Ohio,

    ZIP codes are not inherently geographical indicators of north-south positioning,
    as they are primarily used for mail delivery routes and can be assigned based
    on population density and other factors rather than strict geographical latitude.
    Therefore, interpreting ZIP codes as indicators of north-south positioning can
    lead to ambiguity. Additionally, the question does not specify whether it is asking
    about the geographical center of the ZIP code areas or some other specific point
    within them, which adds to the potential for multiple interpretations.

    positions based on zip codes, which is not a straightforward interpretation. Moreover,
    zip codes can span across different areas that are not necessarily aligned in
    a north-south direction. This makes the question ambiguous as it relies on zip
    codes to determine geographical direction, which is not their intended use.
  - The question asks if a specific zip code in Ohio (45255) is located south of a
    specific zip code in Kansas (66103). While zip codes are often organized geographically,
    they do not follow a strict north-to-south order and are primarily for mail routing
    purposes. The question implies a geographical comparison based on zip codes, which
    do not directly correlate with latitude. Therefore, the question could be interpreted
    in terms of either physical location or zip code numbering, leading to potential
    ambiguity in determining what "south" refers to. Additionally, zip codes are not
    directly comparable on a north-south basis without additional context or a map.

  - 'The question asks whether a specific zip code in Texas is located south of another
    zip code in Florida. While zip codes are numerical and do not inherently convey
    geographical information, they do correspond to specific locations. Therefore,
    this question requires knowledge of the geographical locations of these zip codes
    to determine if one is south of the other. There is only one interpretation: the
    geographical locations of these zip codes in relation to each other. Thus, it
    admits only one correct answer based on those locations.'
  - The question asks if the location corresponding to the zip code 78653 in Texas
    is south of the location corresponding to the zip code 32507 in Florida. The question
    is clear in its intent to compare the geographical positions of two specific zip
    codes. However, zip codes do not inherently provide geographical information such
    as latitude or longitudinal positioning. The answer requires looking up the specific
    locations of these zip codes. Nonetheless, the question itself is straightforward
    in what it is asking, admitting only one interpretation regarding the relative
    location of the two zip codes.
  - The question asks if one location (78653, TX) is south of another location (32507,
    FL) based on their zip codes. Zip codes themselves are not indicative of geographic
    coordinates such as latitude, which is necessary to determine if one location
    is south of another. Without explicit geographic data, zip codes do not provide
    sufficient information to determine relative positions. Therefore, the question
    is ambiguous because it assumes zip codes can be used to determine geographic
    direction, leading to potential misinterpretation.
  - The question is asking whether the location of one zip code in Texas (78653) is
    geographically south of another zip code in Florida (32507). While the question
    seems straightforward, it assumes that zip codes can be directly compared geographically
    based solely on their numbers, which is not accurate. Additionally, the phrasing
    could imply either a comparison of latitude or general location within the states.
    The ambiguity arises from the lack of clarity on whether the question is asking
    about geographic latitude or simply an ordinal comparison of the zip codes themselves,
    which would not be a valid method for determining geographic location.
  - 'The question asks if the location of the zip code 78653 in Texas is south of

    geographic order. Additionally, the question does not specify whether it is asking
    for a comparison based on the central point of each zip code or another criterion.
    Thus, without further context or criteria for determining "south of," the question
    can be interpreted in multiple ways.
  - The question asks if the location of the zip code 78653 in Texas is south of the

    and admits one correct answer based on geographical data.
  - The question asks whether the US zip code 67216 in Kansas is located south of
    the zip code 23111 in Virginia. Zip codes are numerical and are not directly related
    to geographic latitude, so determining "south" requires interpreting the geographic
    locations of these zip codes. However, given the specificity of the zip codes
    and the general knowledge of US geography, this can be interpreted as a question
    about their relative latitudinal positions. Wichita, KS (67216) is indeed south
    of Mechanicsville, VA (23111), based on latitude. Thus, the question has a clear
    interpretation and a single correct answer based on geographic data.
  - The question asks whether a specific zip code in Kansas (67216) is located south
    of a specific zip code in Virginia (23111). The interpretation of the question

  - The question is asking whether a specific location in California (zip code 92503)
    is south of a specific location in South Carolina (zip code 29154). The interpretation
    of "south" is generally clear in a geographical context, referring to a location
    being further in the southern direction on a map. However, the question could
    be seen as ambiguous because it assumes a linear geographical relationship solely
    based on zip codes, which do not always follow a straightforward north-south or
    east-west pattern. Additionally, zip codes are not inherently geographical coordinates,
    so determining "south" requires additional context or a map. Given these considerations,
    the question can lead to different interpretations based on how one defines and
    measures "south." Thus, it can be considered ambiguous.
  - The question is asking whether the location associated with the zip code 92503
    in California is south of the location associated with the zip code 29154 in South
    Carolina. While zip codes are numerical, they are not geographically sequential,
    and their numbers do not directly indicate a north-south or east-west position.
    Therefore, the question is clear in its intent to compare the geographical positions
    of two specific locations based on zip codes, and it can be answered with geographical
    data. There is no room for multiple interpretations of the question itself.
  - The question asks whether a specific location identified by the zip code 92503
    in California is located south of another location identified by the zip code
    29154 in South Carolina. While the question seems to be asking for a geographic
    comparison in terms of latitude, zip codes do not directly correspond to latitude
    and longitude values. However, assuming a standard interpretation that the question
    is about geographic latitude, there is a clear way to determine the answer by
    comparing the latitude of the two locations. Therefore, the question has one interpretation
    and can be answered by checking the geographic coordinates.
  - The question asks whether a specific location with the zip code 92503 in California
    is situated south of another location with the zip code 29154 in South Carolina.
    Zip codes are numerical identifiers for specific geographic areas, and the question
    could be interpreted based on geographical coordinates or simply numerical comparison
    of the zip codes. However, the intention is likely geographical, as zip codes
    themselves don't indicate north/south positioning. Given this interpretation,
    the question is asking for a comparison of the geographical latitudes of the two
    locations, which admits only one correct answer based on their actual physical
    locations on a map.
  - The question is asking whether one location (92503, CA) is south of another (29154,
    SC) based on their zip codes. While zip codes can give a general idea of location,
    they do not directly indicate latitude or geographical positioning. Therefore,
    the question could be interpreted in terms of geographical coordinates (latitude)
    or simply based on the numerical order of zip codes, which do not correlate with
    geographical north-south orientation. As such, the question can be interpreted
    in more than one way, leading to different answers depending on the interpretation
    used.
  - The question asks whether the location associated with the zip code 92503 in California
    is situated south of the location associated with the zip code 29154 in South
    Carolina. The question is asking about the geographical positioning of two specific
    locations based on their zip codes, which can be determined using latitude coordinates.
    This is a straightforward question that involves comparing the latitudinal positions
    of two fixed locations, which admits only one correct interpretation and answer.
  - The question asks whether the location of a specific zip code in California (92503)
    is south of a specific zip code in South Carolina (29154). Zip codes do not inherently
    provide geographical coordinates, and the question assumes a direct relationship
    between zip codes and latitude, which is not necessarily accurate. Furthermore,
    zip codes are not arranged in a strictly north-south or east-west manner. Therefore,
    the interpretation of the question could vary based on assumptions about zip code
    sequences and their geographic implications. This makes the question ambiguous
    because zip codes alone do not determine geographic latitude.
  - 'The question is asking whether a specific zip code in California (92503) is located
    south of a specific zip code in South Carolina (29154). While it seems to focus
    on geographical location, the interpretation of "south" in terms of zip codes
    is unclear. Zip codes are not organized by latitude or cardinal direction but
    rather by postal routes and population centers. Therefore, the question could
    be interpreted in multiple ways: whether 92503 is numerically or geographically
    south of 29154. This ambiguity in what is meant by "south" leads to different
    possible interpretations and answers.'
  - The question asks whether a specific zip code in California (92503) is located
    south of a specific zip code in South Carolina (29154). Zip codes are numerical
    codes used primarily for mail delivery and do not inherently provide geographic
    location information beyond a general area. However, the question is asking about
    the geographic location in terms of north or south, which can be interpreted by
    looking at the latitude of each location. Since there is only one correct interpretation
    by comparing the latitudinal positions of these two specific zip codes, the question
    is clear and does not have multiple interpretations.
  - 'The question is asking about the geographical location of two US zip codes: 92503
    in California and 29154 in South Carolina. The interpretation is straightforward,
    as it asks whether one zip code is located south of the other. This involves comparing
    their latitudinal positions on a map, which can only result in a single correct
    answer. The question does not admit multiple interpretations as it is specific
    about the task of comparing geographical positions.'

  - The question is asking if one zip code (11756, NY) is located south of another
    zip code (10012, NY). Zip codes are numerical representations used primarily for
    postal purposes and do not directly indicate geographical positions such as latitude
    or cardinal directions. However, zip code 11756 corresponds to Levittown, NY,
    which is on Long Island, and 10012 corresponds to an area in Manhattan, NY. Geographically,
    Levittown is located east of Manhattan but slightly south in latitude. Thus, the
    question seems to require interpretation of geographical location based on zip
    codes, which could be seen as a straightforward inquiry into relative latitude.
    Therefore, the question admits a single interpretation based on latitude comparison.
  - The question is asking whether the location corresponding to the zip code 11756
    in New York is south of the location corresponding to the zip code 10012 in New
    York. The question is specific about the geographical relationship between two
    zip codes, which can be determined using geographical data about these zip codes.
    There is no ambiguity in the question as it pertains to a specific and factual
    geographic relationship that can be checked and verified. Thus, the question only
    admits one interpretation and one correct answer.
  - The question is asking whether one zip code (11756) is located south of another
    zip code (10012) in New York. While zip codes can give a rough indication of location,
    they are not strictly organized by geographic coordinates such as latitude. Additionally,
    without specific geographic knowledge of these two zip codes, one could interpret
    the question in different ways. The question assumes that zip codes can be directly
    compared in terms of north-south orientation, which is not always straightforward.
    Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation and could lead to
    different answers depending on how one interprets the relationship between zip
    codes and geographic location.
  - The question is asking if the location of the zip code 11756 in New York is south
    of the location of the zip code 10012 in New York. This requires an understanding
    of geographical positions. The zip code 11756 corresponds to Levittown, NY, while
    10012 corresponds to a part of Manhattan, NY. Geographically, Levittown is located
    on Long Island, which is east and slightly south of Manhattan. However, without
    specific latitude and longitude coordinates or a map reference, the notion of
    "south" can be interpreted differently based on the context (e.g., political boundaries,
    general map orientation). Additionally, the question doesn't specify if "south"
    refers to absolute geographical south or relative positioning within the context
    of New York state or city. This ambiguity in defining "south" leads to multiple
    interpretations of the question.
  - The question asks whether one specific zip code in New York (11756) is located
    south of another zip code in New York (10012). Zip codes are numerical and geographic
    identifiers, and the question is essentially asking about the relative geographic
    positions of two specific areas. The interpretation of "south" in this context
    is clear, referring to a geographic direction. There is only one correct answer
    based on the geographical location of these zip codes. Therefore, the question
    admits only one interpretation and one correct answer.
  - The question is asking about the relative geographical location of two zip codes
    within New York. The zip code 11756 corresponds to Levittown, NY, which is on
    Long Island, while the zip code 10012 is in Manhattan, NY. The question is clear
    in its intention to compare the geographical positions of these two specific zip
    codes. Given that Levittown is generally east and slightly south of Manhattan,
    the question can be answered based on geographical data. There is only one interpretation
    of the question, which is to determine if one zip code is geographically south
    of the other.
  - The question is asking if one zip code (11756) is located south of another zip
    code (10012) within New York. Zip codes are numerical and geographical codes used
    to identify specific areas, but they do not inherently provide directional information
    such as 'north' or 'south.' The question assumes that higher or lower numerical
    zip codes correlate with geographical direction, which is not necessarily true.
    Therefore, without additional context or a specific mapping of zip codes to geographical
    locations, the question can be interpreted in multiple ways regarding what 'south'
    means in terms of zip codes.
  - The question is asking if one location (11756, NY) is south of another location
    (10012, NY). The question seems straightforward at first glance; however, it is
    ambiguous because it assumes that ZIP codes have a direct correlation with geographical
    north-south orientation, which is not necessarily the case. ZIP codes are not
    always assigned in a strictly geographical manner, and two ZIP codes from different
    regions of New York may not have a clear north-south relationship. Therefore,
    the question admits more than one interpretation regarding how to determine the
    relative location based on ZIP codes, leading to potential different answers depending
    on the method used to interpret ZIP code data.
  - The question asks whether one specific zip code (11756, NY) is located south of
    another zip code (10012, NY) within New York. The query is about geographical
    location, specifically latitude comparison, between two known zip codes. Zip codes
    are numerical and can be looked up to determine their approximate geographical
    locations. This question is asking for a straightforward comparison based on the
    geographical positions of these two zip codes. Therefore, it admits only one interpretation
    and one correct answer based on geographical data.
  - The question asks whether zip code 11756 is located south of zip code 10012, both
    in New York. The interpretation of "south" in terms of geographical location is
    clear, as it refers to a straightforward north-south positioning on a map. Zip
    codes can be geographically plotted, and their relative positions can be determined.
    Therefore, this question admits only one interpretation, which is to determine
    the relative north-south position of two specific zip codes.

  - The question asks whether one location (44065, OH) is south of another (46506,
    IN) based on their ZIP codes. While ZIP codes can be associated with geographic
    regions, they do not provide precise information about latitude or the relative
    positions of locations. Additionally, the question assumes that ZIP codes can
    be used to determine geographic direction, which is not always accurate. Therefore,
    the question admits multiple interpretations, such as interpreting ZIP codes as
    geographic indicators or requiring a map to determine actual geographic positions.

    is south of the location represented by the zip code 27051 in North Carolina.
    This appears to be a straightforward geographical question comparing two specific
    locations. However, zip codes do not directly correlate with precise geographic
    coordinates or a direct north-south relationship. The relationship between zip
    codes and geography is complex, and zip codes can represent areas that are not
    strictly north or south of each other. Therefore, without additional context or
    clarification on how the comparison should be made (e.g., based on the center
    of the zip code area or another specific point), the question can be interpreted
    in different ways. This makes the question ambiguous.
  - The question asks whether one zip code (38506, TN) is located south of another

  - The question asks whether the location of the zip code 60559 in Illinois is south
    of the location of the zip code 60514 in Illinois. This question assumes that
    zip codes can be directly compared in terms of geographic orientation based on
    their numerical values, which may not always be accurate. While both zip codes
    are in Illinois, zip code boundaries do not necessarily follow a consistent north-south
    or east-west pattern, meaning that two zip codes with different numbers could
    be in various locations relative to each other. Thus, the question can be interpreted
    in different ways depending on one's understanding of how zip codes are distributed
    geographically. Additionally, without specific geographic data or maps, different
    interpretations of the question could lead to different answers.
  - The question asks whether the location corresponding to the zip code 60559 in
    Illinois is situated south of the location corresponding to the zip code 60514
    in Illinois. Zip codes are numerical and not inherently geographical, meaning
    they do not strictly adhere to geographical cardinal directions. While zip codes
    can sometimes provide a rough idea of location within a state or region, they
    are not designed to indicate precise geographical relationships such as north
    or south. Therefore, the interpretation of "south of" based solely on zip code
    numbers is ambiguous, as it requires additional geographical knowledge or context
    not provided in the question. This lack of clarity in the geographical relationship
    based on zip codes alone makes the question admit more than one interpretation,
    depending on how one interprets the use of zip codes for geographical positioning.
  - The question is asking whether the location corresponding to the zip code 60559
    in Illinois is situated south of the location corresponding to the zip code 60514
    in Illinois. Although it is clear that the question is about geographical positioning
    in terms of latitude, the interpretation of what constitutes "south" could vary
    based on whether the comparison is strictly latitude-based or if additional geographical
    or regional factors are considered. However, since the question specifically references
    zip codes and their locations, it can be interpreted with a focus on latitude
    alone. Thus, the question admits only one interpretation, which is to determine
    the latitude of the two zip codes and compare them. Therefore, the question admits
    one correct answer based on geographical data.
  - The question asks whether the location corresponding to the ZIP code 60559 in
    Illinois is south of the location corresponding to the ZIP code 60514 in Illinois.
    ZIP codes are not assigned in a strictly geographical manner and can be non-contiguous,
    meaning that a higher or lower ZIP code number does not necessarily indicate a
    location that is geographically north or south. Thus, the question's reliance
    on ZIP code numbers for geographic positioning can lead to ambiguity, as ZIP codes
    alone do not provide clear geographic directionality.
  - The question asks whether the location of zip code 60559 in Illinois is south
    of zip code 60514 in Illinois. While the question seems straightforward, it is
    ambiguous due to the nature of zip codes. Zip codes are not strictly geographical
    and do not necessarily follow a north-south or east-west progression. Therefore,
    without specific geographical data or maps to reference, the question can lead
    to different interpretations or answers based on different assumptions about the
    organization of zip codes.

  - The question asks if the location of the ZIP code 55038 in Minnesota is south
    of the ZIP code 55316 in Minnesota. ZIP codes are numerical representations and
    do not inherently convey geographic directionality. While ZIP codes are generally
    assigned geographically, there can be exceptions, and they do not strictly follow
    north-south or east-west lines. Therefore, determining "south" based on ZIP codes
    alone without additional geographic context is ambiguous. The question could be
    interpreted as asking about the relative geographic locations based on ZIP codes
    alone, which is not a reliable method. Additionally, without specific geographic
    data or maps, one cannot definitively determine the relative positions solely
    based on ZIP codes.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative location of two specific zip codes
    in Minnesota: 55038 and 55316. Zip codes are numerical and generally increase

    the question is not asking for a subjective interpretation or a matter of opinion
    but rather about the geographical location of two specific areas. This can be
    determined by looking up the geographical coordinates or map locations of the
    two zip codes. The interpretation here is straightforward and does not allow for
    multiple meanings.'
  - The question asks whether one specific zip code (55038, MN) is located south of
    another zip code (55316, MN). The interpretation of "south" in this context is
    geographical, referring to latitude. Since zip codes are geographical markers,
    the question is straightforward in asking for a comparison of their geographical
    positions based on latitude. There is only one correct answer based on the geographical
    data of the zip codes in question. Therefore, the question admits only one interpretation
    and one correct answer.
  - The question is asking whether one zip code (55038, MN) is located south of another
    zip code (55316, MN). This is a geographic question that relies on the relative
    positioning of the two zip codes within the state of Minnesota. The question is
    clear in its intent, as it seeks a straightforward answer about the geographic
    relation between two specific locations. The interpretation does not vary; it
    is strictly a matter of determining the north-south positioning of the two zip

  - The question is asking if a specific zip code (55038, MN) is located south of
    another zip code (55316, MN). Zip codes are numerical representations and do not
    inherently provide geographic orientation. However, given that the question specifies
    MN (Minnesota) and zip codes generally follow a geographical pattern, the question
    can be understood as asking for the relative geographical location of two specific
    places within the state. Since zip codes in Minnesota generally increase from
    south to north, the question can be interpreted to have a clear answer based on
    geographic data. Therefore, it admits one interpretation and one correct answer.
  - The question asks whether the location of the zip code 55038 in Minnesota is south
    of the location of the zip code 55316 in Minnesota. This can be interpreted as
    a geographical query that seeks to compare the latitudinal positions of two specific
    zip codes. Geographical locations can be clearly determined using maps or GPS
    coordinates, which provide definitive answers regarding the relative positions
    of these zip codes. Therefore, the question admits one interpretation and one
    correct answer based on geographical data.
  - The question asks whether the location with zip code 55038 in Minnesota is south
    of the location with zip code 55316 in Minnesota. Zip codes are not strictly geographical
    indicators of north-south positioning, as they are primarily used for postal purposes
    and do not always follow geographical logic. Therefore, determining whether one
    zip code is south of another based purely on the zip codes themselves can be misleading
    without additional geographical data. Additionally, without specific knowledge
    of the geographical positions of these zip codes or a map, the question can be
    interpreted in different ways depending on one's understanding of how zip codes
    correlate with geographic locations. Thus, the question is open to interpretation

    context, meaning a lower latitude number. Therefore, this question admits only
    one interpretation and one correct answer based on geographical data.
  - The question asks whether the location of the zip code 55038 in Minnesota is south
    of the location of the zip code 55316 in Minnesota. This is a straightforward
    geographical question about the relative position of two specific zip codes within
    the state. The question does not admit multiple interpretations because zip codes
    have fixed geographical locations, and determining whether one is south of the
    other is a matter of checking these specific locations on a map. Thus, it admits
    one interpretation and one correct answer.
  - 'The question asks whether the location associated with the zip code 55038 in

    of a specific zip code in Florida (32351). The question is geographically oriented,
    asking about the relative position of two locations based on their zip codes.
    The interpretation is straightforward: it is asking for a comparison of the latitudinal
    positions of the two locations. Zip code 36582 corresponds to Theodore, Alabama,
    and 32351 corresponds to Quincy, Florida. Based on geographic coordinates, Theodore,
    AL (36582) is indeed located south of Quincy, FL (32351). There is only one interpretation

  - The question is asking whether one zip code area is located south of another.
    The zip code 36582 is in Alabama, and 32351 is in Florida. However, zip codes
    do not follow a strict north-to-south order geographically, and the question does
    not specify a method for determining "south of," such as by specific latitude
    or a particular reference point within the zip code area. The question could be
    interpreted in different ways depending on how one defines "located south of"
    (e.g., center point of the zip code, southernmost point, or some other criteria).
    Thus, the question admits more than one interpretation.
  - The question asks whether the location associated with the zip code 36582 in Alabama
    is south of the location associated with the zip code 32351 in Florida. The interpretation

  - The question is asking if the location of the zip code 48221 in Michigan is south
    of the location of the zip code 01908 in Massachusetts. On the surface, it seems
    like a straightforward geographical question. However, zip codes do not inherently
    indicate latitude or longitude, and they are not assigned in a way that directly
    correlates to geographic positions like north or south. Therefore, without additional
    context or specific geographic data, the question could be interpreted as asking
    for a comparison based on other criteria (like numeric order or some non-geographical
    metric), making the question ambiguous in terms of geographic positioning.
  - 'The question asks if the location of the zip code 48221 in Michigan is south

  - The question asks whether the zip code 62208 in Illinois is located south of the
    zip code 62269 in Illinois. This is a geographic question that can be answered
    by examining the relative latitudinal positions of the two zip codes. The question
    is clear in its request for a geographic comparison based on latitude, which has
    only one interpretation and can be answered definitively with geographic data.
  - The question is asking whether the location associated with the zip code 62208
    in Illinois is south of the location associated with the zip code 62269 in Illinois.
    The interpretation of the question is straightforward, as it pertains to geographical
    positioning based on zip codes. There is no ambiguity in the question as it clearly
    specifies the zip codes and the directional query (south). The answer can be determined
    using geographical data or maps that provide the latitude of these zip codes.
  - The question is asking whether the location of one zip code (62208, IL) is south
    of another zip code (62269, IL). This can be interpreted in a straightforward
    geographical sense, as zip codes are generally associated with specific areas.
    However, zip codes are not strictly organized in a north-to-south or east-to-west
    manner, and their numbering does not inherently provide information about geographic
    orientation. Therefore, determining whether one zip code is "south" of another
    based solely on the numbers requires additional geographic information. Since
    the question does not specify how to interpret the location (e.g., by geographic
    coordinates or another method), it admits more than one interpretation and could
    lead to different answers depending on the context used to determine "south."
    Therefore, the question is ambiguous.
  - The question is asking if the location corresponding to the zip code 62208 in
    Illinois is south of the location corresponding to the zip code 62269 in Illinois.
    This question is based on geographic location, which typically has one correct
    answer based on the latitude of each zip code. Thus, it admits only one interpretation
    and one correct answer regarding the relative positions of these zip codes.
  - The question asks whether the location with the zip code 62208 in Illinois is

    The interpretation here is straightforward as it involves a geographical comparison
    based on latitude. Therefore, the question admits only one interpretation and
    one correct answer based on geographical data.
  - The question is asking whether one zip code in Illinois (62208) is located south
    of another zip code (62269). Zip codes are not inherently indicative of geographical
    north-south positioning; they are primarily used for postal purposes and can be
    assigned in ways that do not correspond to a simple linear progression. However,
    the question is clear in its request for a geographic comparison between two specific
    zip codes. Therefore, there is only one interpretation of the question, which
    is to determine the relative north-south positioning of these two locations based
    on geographical data.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 62208 in Illinois is located south of the
    zip code 62269 in Illinois. While zip codes are generally assigned in a roughly
    geographical order, they do not strictly follow latitude lines, and the layout
    can be non-linear. Therefore, determining which zip code is south of another based
    solely on their numerical order is not reliable. This introduces ambiguity because
    the question could be interpreted as asking about either the numerical order of
    zip codes or their actual geographical locations, which may not align. Thus, without
    additional geographical data, the question admits more than one interpretation.
  - The question asks whether one zip code (62208, IL) is located south of another
    zip code (62269, IL) within the state of Illinois. The interpretation of the question
    is straightforward as it concerns geographical location based on zip codes. There
    is no ambiguity in the terms used or the information requested; it is purely a
    matter of determining the relative geographical positions of two specific zip
    codes. The question admits one clear interpretation and one correct answer based
    on factual geographical data.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 62208, IL is located south of 62269, IL.
    This is a specific geographic query that can be answered by checking the relative
    positions of these two zip codes on a map. The question is straightforward, as
    it involves comparing the locations of two specific zip codes in Illinois, USA,
    and determining their relative north-south positions. There is only one correct
    geographic interpretation and answer for this question.
  - The question is asking whether one US zip code (62208, IL) is located south of
    another zip code (62269, IL). While zip codes are often assigned in a geographical
    sequence, they are not always perfectly linear or indicative of exact geographical
    relationships such as north, south, east, or west. Additionally, without specific
    mapping data, the relative position of these zip codes cannot be determined based
    on the numbers alone. However, the question does not present multiple interpretations;
    it is a straightforward query about geographical location that requires external
    data to answer accurately. Hence, the question itself admits only one interpretation
    regarding the relative geographical positioning, which is to ascertain if one
    is located south of the other.

  - 'The question asks whether the location of the zip code 11436, NY is south of
    the location of the zip code 11231, NY. This is a straightforward geographical
    question that can be answered by comparing the latitude of the two zip codes.
    The interpretation is clear: it is asking for a comparison of north-south positioning
    between two specific locations. Therefore, it admits one interpretation and one
    correct answer based on geographical data.'
  - The question asks whether one zip code in New York (11436) is located south of
    another zip code in New York (11231). Zip codes can be used to approximate geographic
    locations, but they don't follow strict geographic boundaries, and multiple interpretations
    are possible. The question assumes a geographic interpretation of "south," which
    could be based on different criteria like latitude or a more general notion of
    "southerness." Additionally, zip codes are not strictly ordered geographically.
    Therefore, the question could lead to different interpretations and answers, depending
    on how one defines "south" in this context.
  - 'The question asks whether the location identified by the zip code 11436, NY is
    south of the location identified by the zip code 11231, NY. Zip codes are specific
    identifiers for geographic areas, and their locations can be precisely determined
    using maps or geographic databases. Therefore, the question is specific and can
    be answered definitively by checking the geographic positions of the two zip codes.
    There is only one interpretation of the question: it is asking for a geographical
    comparison between two specific locations. Thus, it admits only one correct answer
    based on geographic data.'
  - 'The question asks whether the zip code 11436 in New York is located south of
    the zip code 11231 in New York. Zip codes are numerical identifiers for postal
    delivery areas, and they do not inherently convey geographic information like
    latitude or longitude. However, zip codes can be mapped to physical locations,
    and their relative positions can be determined using geographic data. Therefore,
    the question can be interpreted in one clear way: determining the geographic location
    of these two zip codes and comparing their latitudinal coordinates to see which
    one is further south. This does not lead to multiple interpretations or answers,
    as it is purely a matter of geographic fact.'
  - The question asks whether one zip code (11436, NY) is located south of another
    zip code (11231, NY). The question is clear in its request for a geographical
    comparison based on latitude. Zip codes are specific areas, and their relative
    positions can be determined based on latitude. Therefore, the question has only
    one interpretation and can be answered by comparing the latitudinal positions
    of the two zip codes.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographic location of two specific
    zip codes in New York. The interpretation hinges on whether these zip codes can
    be precisely located on a map and whether there is a clear, singular interpretation
    of what "south of" means in this context. US zip codes are defined geographic
    areas, and their relative positions can be determined using a map. Therefore,
    this question can be interpreted in one clear way: determining the geographic
    latitude of the two zip codes and comparing them. This results in a straightforward
    answer as to which zip code is located further south.'
  - The question asks whether the location of one US zip code (11436, NY) is south
    of another zip code (11231, NY). To determine this, one would need to know the
    geographical locations associated with these zip codes. There is only one interpretation
    of the question, which is a geographical comparison based on latitude. The question
    is clear in its request for a geographical direction comparison, and with the
    appropriate geographical data, it admits only one correct answer. Therefore, the
    question is not open to multiple interpretations.

  - The question asks if a specific location in Virginia (with zip code 22042) is
    located south of a specific location in Missouri (with zip code 64082). The question
    is clear in its request for geographical information based on the latitude of
    these two locations. Zip codes can be used to determine approximate geographical
    locations, and latitude can be used to determine if one location is south of another.
    Therefore, this question is clear as it admits one interpretation and one correct
    answer based on geographical data.
  - The question asks if one location (22042, VA) is south of another (64082, MO)
    based on their zip codes. While zip codes can be associated with geographic locations,
    they do not inherently provide information about latitude or direction (north,
    south, etc.). The question can be interpreted as asking for a geographical comparison,
    but since zip codes themselves don't convey directional information, the question
    relies on an assumption about geographical knowledge. However, the question is
    clear in its intent to ask about the geographical location of two specific areas.
    Thus, it has a single interpretation and can be answered using geographical data
    regarding the locations of VA and MO relative to each other.
  - 'The question is asking if a specific zip code in Virginia (22042) is located
    south of a specific zip code in Missouri (64082). The question involves geographic
    locations, which can be determined by latitude. However, the question could be
    interpreted in different ways: it could be asking if the entire area covered by
    the Virginia zip code is south of the entire area covered by the Missouri zip
    code, or if the centers of these zip code areas are to be compared. Additionally,
    zip codes do not follow a strict geographical order, so their numerical order
    doesn''t provide information about their relative locations. Given these interpretations,
    the question could lead to different answers based on how one interprets the geographical
    comparison (area vs. center). Therefore, the question is ambiguous.'
  - The question is asking whether one location (22042, VA) is located south of another
    location (64082, MO). This question can be interpreted in terms of geographical
    latitude comparison. There is only one correct way to determine if one location
    is south of another, by comparing their latitude values. Therefore, the question
    admits only one interpretation and one correct answer based on geographical coordinates.
  - The question asks whether the location associated with the ZIP code 22042 in Virginia
    is south of the location associated with the ZIP code 64082 in Missouri. This
    question is geographic in nature and seeks a straightforward answer based on the
    relative latitudinal positions of these two locations. ZIP codes are tied to specific
    geographic areas, and their relative positions can be determined by looking at
    a map or using geographic data. Therefore, the question has a clear interpretation
    and a definitive answer based on geographic coordinates.
  - The question asks whether the location with the zip code 22042 in Virginia is
    south of the location with the zip code 64082 in Missouri. While zip codes can
    provide specific locations, they are not inherently related to geographic coordinates
    such as latitude. Therefore, the question can be interpreted in terms of comparing
    geographic latitudes. By interpreting the question in terms of latitude, there
    is a clear answer based on the geographic coordinates of these zip codes. Zip
    code 22042 in Virginia is indeed located at a higher latitude (further north)
    than zip code 64082 in Missouri, which is further south. Thus, the question admits
    only one interpretation and one correct answer.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 22042 in Virginia is located south of the
    zip code 64082 in Missouri. Zip codes are numerical codes used to identify specific
    geographic areas within the United States, and they do not inherently convey directional
    information like north or south. However, the question can be interpreted in a
    straightforward manner by considering the geographic locations of the two places
    associated with the given zip codes. Specifically, 22042 is in Falls Church, Virginia,
    and 64082 is in Lee's Summit, Missouri. By examining a map or using geographic
    data, one could determine that Virginia is generally located to the east of Missouri,
    and Falls Church is indeed situated north of Lee's Summit. Therefore, there is
    only one interpretation and one correct answer to this question based on geographic
    locations.
  - The question asks if a specific zip code in Virginia (22042) is located south
    of a specific zip code in Missouri (64082). The question is clear in its geographic
    context, asking for a comparison in terms of latitude. Zip codes are fixed geographic
    areas, so the location of each can be precisely determined. Therefore, the question
    admits only one interpretation and one correct answer based on the geographic
    locations of these zip codes.
  - The question is asking whether a location in Virginia (zip code 22042) is south
    of a location in Missouri (zip code 64082). This can be interpreted geographically
    by determining the relative latitudinal positions of the two locations. The question
    is clear in its intent to compare the geographical positions of the two zip codes
    based on latitude. However, it assumes that the reader knows that VA refers to
    Virginia and MO refers to Missouri, which are common state abbreviations in the
    United States. Thus, the question admits one interpretation and one correct answer
    based on geographic data.
  - 'The question is asking whether a specific zip code in Virginia (22042) is located
    south of a specific zip code in Missouri (64082). This question can be interpreted
    in only one way: it is asking for a geographical comparison based on latitude
    between two specific locations. Given that latitude is an objective measure, there
    is only one correct answer to this question. Therefore, the question does not
    admit multiple interpretations.'

  - The question is asking if one zip code (33624, FL) is located south of another
    zip code (34684, FL). The interpretation of "south" in this context is geographic,
    relating to latitude. Zip codes are numeric identifiers and their numbers don't
    necessarily correspond to geographic latitude. Therefore, the question requires
    external geographic information to determine whether 33624 is indeed south of
    34684. However, the question itself is not ambiguous in terms of interpretation;
    it is clear what is being asked, which is whether one location is geographically
    south of another. The question admits one interpretation regarding geographic
    location, though it requires factual knowledge to answer.
  - The question asks whether one specific ZIP code in Florida (33624) is located
    south of another ZIP code in Florida (34684). The interpretation of "south" in
    this context is straightforward, referring to geographical direction. ZIP codes
    are specific and have defined geographical areas, so determining whether one is
    south of another is a matter of comparing their geographical positions. There
    is no ambiguity in the terms used, as "south" in this context refers to a clear
    cardinal direction, and ZIP codes are precise identifiers.
  - The question is asking whether the area corresponding to the ZIP code 33624 in
    Florida is located south of the area corresponding to the ZIP code 34684 in Florida.
    The question is based on geographic locations of specific ZIP codes, which are
    fixed and can be determined using geographic data. ZIP codes are specific to particular
    areas and do not overlap, so there is only one correct geographic location for
    each ZIP code. Therefore, this question admits only one interpretation and one
    correct answer based on the geographic data of these ZIP codes.
  - 'The question is asking if one zip code area is located south of another in Florida.
    The interpretation of the question is straightforward: it is inquiring about the
    geographical positions of two specific zip code areas relative to each other.
    There is only one correct answer based on the actual geographical data of these
    zip code areas. Thus, the question does not admit multiple interpretations or
    answers.'
  - The question is asking whether the location represented by the zip code 33624
    in Florida is south of the location represented by the zip code 34684 in Florida.
    This question involves geographical positioning, and given that zip codes are
    specific to certain areas, it should have a definitive answer based on the latitude
    of each zip code area. However, zip codes are not always assigned in a strictly
    geographical order, so the question may require looking up the exact locations
    to provide a precise answer. Despite this, the question itself is clear in its
    request for a comparison of geographical positions.
  - The question is asking if one specific zip code area (33624, FL) is located south
    of another zip code area (34684, FL) within Florida. This requires geographical
    knowledge or access to a map to determine the relative positions of these two
    zip codes. The question is clear in its intent, asking for a straightforward geographical
    comparison. There is no ambiguity in the question as it is seeking a specific
    directional relationship between two fixed locations.
  - The question is asking whether the location corresponding to the zip code 33624
    in Florida is situated south of the location corresponding to the zip code 34684
    in Florida. While zip codes generally follow a geographic pattern, they are not
    strictly ordered by latitude. Therefore, determining the relative geographic position
    of two zip codes based solely on their numeric values can be misleading. To answer
    this question, one would need to look up the actual geographic coordinates or
    map locations of the zip codes in question. However, the question itself is clear
    in its intent and does not present multiple interpretations; it simply requires
    geographic data to answer accurately.
  - The question asks if one location, identified by the zip code 33624, is south
    of another location, identified by the zip code 34684, both in Florida. This question
    is asking for a geographical comparison based on latitude between two specific
    locations. The interpretation of "south" is consistent as it refers to a direction
    based on the Earth's geography. Therefore, the question admits only one interpretation,
    which is to compare the latitudinal positions of the two zip codes to determine
    which one is further south.
  - 'The question asks whether the location associated with the zip code 33624 in
    Florida is south of the location associated with the zip code 34684 in Florida.
    This question is clear because it involves a straightforward comparison of the

  - The question is asking whether one location in Pennsylvania (zip code 15601) is
    south of another location in Pennsylvania (zip code 19608). While zip codes can
    be associated with specific geographic regions, they do not inherently provide
    precise latitude or longitude information. Additionally, without a map or additional
    geographical data, it is not possible to definitively determine the relative positions
    of these zip codes based solely on the numerical values. Thus, the interpretation
    of "south" could vary depending on the specific geographic information one might
    use to answer this, leading to potentially different answers based on different
    data sources or assumptions.
  - The question asks whether one zip code in Pennsylvania (15601) is located south
    of another zip code in Pennsylvania (19608). This question could be considered
    ambiguous for a couple of reasons. Firstly, zip codes do not necessarily follow
    a strict geographical order, so their numerical order does not reliably indicate
    their north-south positioning. Secondly, the question does not specify the criteria
    for determining "located south" (e.g., the geographical center of the zip code
    area, the southernmost point, etc.). Due to these interpretations, the question
    could lead to different answers based on different criteria or assumptions about
    how to determine the relative southward location of zip codes.
  - The question asks whether the location of the zip code 15601, PA is south of the
    location of the zip code 19608, PA. This question is straightforward and involves
    determining the relative geographical positions of two specific zip codes within
    Pennsylvania. The task involves checking the latitude of the two locations. There
    is only one interpretation and a definitive answer based on geographical data.
  - The question asks whether one zip code in Pennsylvania is located south of another
    zip code in the same state. The issue lies in the interpretation of zip codes
    as geographical indicators. Zip codes are primarily used for mail delivery purposes
    and do not necessarily follow a strict geographical order. While it is possible
    to determine the geographical locations of these zip codes, the question assumes
    a direct relationship between the zip code numbers and their relative geographical
    positions, which is not always accurate. Therefore, the question can lead to different
    interpretations based on how one considers zip codes as geographical indicators.
  - The question is asking if one zip code (15601) is located south of another zip
    code (19608) in Pennsylvania. Zip codes are primarily for mail delivery purposes
    and do not follow a geographic order. While one could attempt to interpret this
    question by looking at the geographical coordinates or map, zip codes themselves
    are not inherently indicative of geographic direction. Furthermore, without a
    map or additional geographic information, the question can be interpreted differently
    because zip codes do not provide clear directional indicators. Thus, the question
    admits more than one interpretation regarding the location of these zip codes
    relative to each other.
  - The question is asking about the geographical location of two zip codes in Pennsylvania.
    It is clear that the question is inquiring whether the zip code 15601 is located
    south of the zip code 19608. There is only one interpretation of this question,
    which involves comparing the geographical latitudes of the two zip codes to determine
    which is located further south. Therefore, the question is straightforward and
    only admits one correct answer based on geographical data.
  - The question asks whether one location (15601, PA) is south of another location
    (19608, PA). This is a geographical question that relies on the specific latitude
    of each zip code to determine if one is south of the other. Given the specific
    nature of the question, it does not admit multiple interpretations, as latitude
    is an objective measure. Therefore, it can only have one correct answer based
    on geographical data.
  - The question is asking if one location (15601, PA) is south of another location
    (19608, PA) based on their zip codes. However, zip codes do not inherently provide
    geographical direction or positioning information. The question assumes that zip
    codes can be used to determine north-south positioning, which is not accurate
    as zip codes are not assigned based on latitude or a consistent geographical order.
    Therefore, the question is ambiguous because it relies on an incorrect assumption
    about the nature of zip codes, leading to potentially different interpretations
    or answers depending on how one interprets the role of zip codes in geographical
    positioning.
  - The question asks whether one US zip code (15601, PA) is located south of another
    zip code (19608, PA). Zip codes do not inherently provide geographical information
    such as cardinal directions (north, south, etc.) relative to one another. To determine
    the relative positions, one would need to look up the geographical coordinates
    or map locations of each zip code. The question assumes a straightforward interpretation
    based on geographical positioning. However, without additional context or a map,
    this could lead to different interpretations regarding the method to determine
    "south of." Therefore, the question may not have a singular, straightforward answer
    based solely on zip codes.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographic location of two ZIP codes
    in Pennsylvania: 15601 and 19608. This question is clear because it asks specifically
    about the direction (south) of one ZIP code relative to another. The ZIP codes
    can be looked up to determine their geographic coordinates, and a comparison can
    be made to determine if 15601 is indeed located south of 19608. Therefore, the
    question admits one interpretation and one correct answer.'

    admit multiple interpretations.
  - The question is asking if one specific zip code area in Kentucky (40601) is located
    south of another specific zip code area (40211). The interpretation of the question
    is straightforward, as it involves determining the geographical relation (specifically
    the north-south orientation) between two fixed locations. There is only one correct
    answer to this question based on geographical data, assuming zip code boundaries
    are known and do not overlap in this context. Therefore, the question does not
    admit more than one interpretation or answer.
  - The question is asking about the relative geographic location of two zip codes
    within the state of Kentucky, USA. The interpretation hinges on understanding
    the numeric order of zip codes and their geographic placement. However, zip codes
    are not always assigned in a strictly geographic manner; they often relate to
    postal routes or historical reasons. As a result, two zip codes that are numerically
    close may not follow a straightforward north-south or east-west geographic order.
    Therefore, without specific geographic knowledge or reference, the question could
    be interpreted in more than one way, leading to ambiguity in determining which
    location is actually south of the other.
  - The question asks whether a specific zip code in Kentucky (40601) is located south
    of another zip code in Kentucky (40211). The interpretation of the question is
    straightforward as it asks for a geographical comparison based on latitude. There

    and one correct answer.
  - The question is asking if a specific zip code (40601) in Kentucky is located south
    of another zip code (40211) in the same state. The question is clear in terms
    of what it is asking geographically. However, the interpretation depends on understanding
    the geographic locations of these zip codes, which is a straightforward matter
    of checking a map or a database of zip codes. Since there is only one correct
    geographic interpretation of whether one location is south of another, the question
    is clear and admits only one correct answer.
  - The question is asking about the relative location of two zip codes in Kentucky.
    The question could be interpreted in terms of geographic latitude, where "south"
    implies a lower latitude number. However, zip codes do not strictly follow geographic
    latitude or longitude. They are more related to postal delivery routes and can
    have irregular geographic distributions. Therefore, determining if one zip code
    is south of another based purely on the zip code numbers without consulting a
    map or geographic data can lead to different interpretations and answers.
  - The question is asking whether one location in Kentucky (40601) is located south
    of another location in Kentucky (40211) based on their zip codes. The question
    assumes that zip codes can be used to determine geographical positioning in terms
    of north or south. However, zip codes are not always arranged in a strictly geographic
    manner, which introduces ambiguity. Additionally, without more context, such as
    a map or geographic data, it is unclear if the question is asking about the general
    area of the zip codes or specific points within them. Therefore, the question
    can have different interpretations, leading to different answers depending on
    how one interprets the role of zip codes in determining geographic location.

    north-south or east-west orientations. Therefore, the question could be interpreted
    in two ways: (1) as a straightforward geographical query based on latitude, or
    (2) as a misunderstanding of the significance of zip code numbers in relation

  - The question asks whether one zip code in Pennsylvania (18102) is located south
    of another zip code in Pennsylvania (15014). This question is based on geographical
    location and can be answered by determining the relative positions of these zip
    codes on a map. The interpretation here is straightforward, focusing on the geographic
    orientation of the two specified zip codes. Therefore, the question admits only
    one interpretation and one correct answer based on geographical data.

    specific locations identified by their ZIP codes. There is only one interpretation
    of the question: determining the relative north-south position of the two given
    ZIP codes. The answer can be objectively determined by looking up the geographical
    coordinates (latitude) of both ZIP codes.'
  - The question asks whether the location associated with the zip code 22554 in Virginia
    is situated south of the location associated with the zip code 40031 in Kentucky.
    The question is specific about comparing geographical locations based on their
    latitude. Each zip code corresponds to a specific area with a fixed latitude and
    longitude, so there is only one correct interpretation and answer to whether one
    is south of the other.
  - The question asks whether the location associated with the zip code 22554 in Virginia
    is south of the location associated with the zip code 40031 in Kentucky. While
    zip codes can give a general indication of location, they do not correspond directly
    to geographic coordinates such as latitude and longitude. Therefore, determining
    which is south requires converting zip codes to geographic data. However, the
    question is unambiguous in its intent, asking for a straightforward comparison
    of latitude between two specific locations represented by these zip codes.
  - 'The question is asking whether a specific location in Virginia (22554) is south
    of a location in Kentucky (40031) based on their zip codes. Zip codes do not directly
    correlate with geographic coordinates, such as latitude, which determine what
    is "south" or "north." Therefore, the question could be interpreted in two ways:
    (1) Whether the zip code number (22554) is numerically less than 40031, which
    is a non-geographic comparison, or (2) Whether the physical location of 22554
    in Virginia is geographically south of 40031 in Kentucky. These interpretations
    can lead to different answers, making the question ambiguous.'
  - The question asks whether the location of zip code 22554 in Virginia is south
    of zip code 40031 in Kentucky. This question relies on geographical data to determine
    if one zip code is geographically south of the other. The interpretation of the
    question is straightforward, as it involves comparing latitudinal coordinates,
    which will yield a single correct answer based on geographical facts.
  - The question asks whether the location of the zip code 22554 in Virginia is south
    of the location of the zip code 40031 in Kentucky. This question is clear because
    it specifies two distinct zip codes and asks for a straightforward geographical
    comparison based on latitude. Zip codes are associated with specific geographic
    locations, and the determination of whether one is south of another can be answered
    with a map or geographic data. Therefore, the question admits only one interpretation
    and has one correct answer.
  - 'The question is asking whether the location of a specific zip code in Virginia
    (22554) is south of another specific zip code in Kentucky (40031). The question
    seems to be about geographical location and can be interpreted in one clear way:
    determining the relative positions of these two locations on a map. The latitude
    of each zip code can be used to determine which one is further south. There is
    no ambiguity in how the question is phrased or what it is asking for.'
  - The question asks whether the location corresponding to the US zip code 22554
    in Virginia is south of the location corresponding to the US zip code 40031 in
    Kentucky. It seems to be a straightforward geographical question about the relative
    positions of two specific zip codes. However, the potential ambiguity arises from
    the fact that the question does not specify the criteria for "south" (e.g., the
    geographical center of the zip code area, a specific point within the area, etc.).
    Nevertheless, in a typical interpretation, this would involve comparing the latitudinal
    coordinates of the central points of the two zip codes to determine which is further
    south. Since the primary interpretation involves determining the relative geographical
    position based on latitude, it can be considered as having one main interpretation
    and answer.
  - The question asks whether the location with the zip code 22554 in Virginia is
    south of the location with the zip code 40031 in Kentucky. The interpretation
    of "south" is clear in terms of geographic direction. However, without specific
    geographical data, one might assume the question is asking for a straightforward
    comparison of latitude. Given that latitude coordinates are definitive, the question
    can be answered by checking whether the latitude of 22554 is less than that of
    40031. Therefore, the question can be interpreted with a single method of resolution,
    using geographic coordinates.

    be interpreted in different ways: it could be asking for the relative geographic
    location based on latitude, or it could be interpreted based on how zip codes
    are structured within the postal system, which does not strictly correlate to
    geographic positioning. This ambiguity in how zip codes relate to geographic directions
    leads to multiple interpretations and potential answers.'
  - The question asks whether the zip code 19131 in Pennsylvania is located south
    of the zip code 19134 in Pennsylvania. This question is asking for a geographical
    comparison based on zip codes. Zip codes are numerical and don't inherently convey
    geographical positioning. However, zip codes are often assigned in a manner that
    can suggest geographical areas, though not always linearly. The question implies
    a need for geographical knowledge of these specific areas or a map. Given that
    zip codes do not follow strict geographical order and the question does not specify

    based on their geographical positions.'
  - The question asks if the zip code 19131 is located south of the zip code 19134
    in Pennsylvania. Zip codes are numerical and do not inherently provide geographic
    information such as cardinal directions. Although zip codes often follow a numerical
    order that can suggest a geographic pattern, this is not always strictly true,
    especially within the same city or region where zip codes may not be sequentially
    arranged in a north-to-south or east-to-west manner. Without additional geographic
    or mapping data, the question cannot be definitively answered based solely on
    the zip code numbers. Therefore, the question is open to interpretation based
    on assumptions about zip code distribution.
  - 'The question asks whether the zip code 19131 in Pennsylvania is located south
    of the zip code 19134, also in Pennsylvania. This question seems clear in its
    intent to determine the geographical relationship between the two specific zip

  - The question asks whether the zip code 19131 in Pennsylvania is located south
    of the zip code 19134 in Pennsylvania. This question is clear in its request for
    a geographical comparison based on the latitude of two specific zip codes. The
    interpretation is straightforward as it pertains to the geographic locations of
    the zip codes within the state of Pennsylvania. There is only one correct interpretation
    and answer based on geographic data, as each zip code corresponds to a specific
    area on the map.
  - The question involves determining the relative geographic location of two ZIP
    codes, 19131 and 19134, both in Pennsylvania. ZIP codes are numerical and do not
    inherently convey geographic orientation. However, ZIP code 19131 is in Philadelphia,
    as is 19134. While ZIP codes can sometimes give a rough indication of proximity,
    they do not reliably indicate geographic direction (north, south, east, west)
    because they are primarily designed for postal route efficiency rather than strict
    geographic logic. Therefore, determining whether one ZIP code is south of another
    solely based on the numbers is not possible without additional geographic data.
    This leads to potential ambiguity in interpreting the question, as ZIP codes do
    not inherently provide clear directional information without a map or additional
    context.
  - The question asks whether one zip code (19131, PA) is located south of another
    zip code (19134, PA). Zip codes are not inherently geographical coordinates that
    indicate north or south positions; they are numerical codes used by postal services.
    While zip codes can sometimes loosely correlate with geographic areas, they do
    not provide a precise measure of north-south positioning. Thus, interpreting zip
    codes as a measure of geographic direction is not straightforward. Additionally,
    the question does not specify a method for determining "south" (e.g., by the geographic
    center of the zip code area, by a specific location within the zip code, etc.),
    leading to potential multiple interpretations. Therefore, the question can be
    interpreted in different ways, resulting in different answers depending on the
    approach used to determine "south."
  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographical location of two specific

    up or have knowledge of their specific locations to determine their relative positions.
    However, the question itself is straightforward in asking whether one is south
    of the other, which does not present multiple interpretations of the question
    itself, only the need for geographical knowledge.'

    is south of the location associated with the zip code 55055 in Minnesota. This
    question appears to be asking for a geographical comparison based on latitude.
    While the interpretation of the question seems straightforward, the issue lies
    in the assumption that zip codes can be directly compared to determine north-south
    positioning. Zip codes are not always assigned in a strictly geographical manner,
    so the question might require verification through mapping tools or geographical
    data. However, the question itself is clear in asking for a specific north-south
    comparison between two locations identified by zip codes.
  - The question asks whether the location of the zip code 54474 in Wisconsin is south
    of the zip code 55055 in Minnesota. On the surface, this seems straightforward,
    as it is asking for a geographic comparison based on latitude. However, the interpretation
    hinges on the assumption that the zip codes are accurately represented by a specific
    latitude and that "south" refers to geographic direction based on latitude. Given
    that zip codes can cover areas that might not be perfectly aligned along simple
    north-south lines, and that "located south" might be interpreted differently depending
    on context (e.g., geographical center vs. any part of the area), the question

    do not necessarily follow a north-south or east-west progression. Without a clear
    reference to geographic coordinates or a specific map, the question could be interpreted
    in different ways. Additionally, zip codes are used for postal purposes and may
    not align neatly with geographic directions. Therefore, while someone could look

    of "south" in terms of zip codes is not directly related to geographical latitude.
    Zip codes are not always organized in a way that correlates with geographic location
    on a north-south axis. Therefore, the question could be interpreted as asking
    about geographic location or about some other characteristic of the zip codes
    that might be metaphorically "south." Without additional context, such as a map

    based on latitude. However, zip codes are not strictly arranged in a north-south
    or east-west manner, and they can sometimes be non-contiguous or arranged based
    on postal routes rather than geographical latitude. This could lead to different
    interpretations of what "located south" means in this context. Therefore, while

  - 'The question is asking if one U.S. zip code is located south of another. However,
    U.S. zip codes are not organized geographically in a strictly north-to-south manner.
    They are primarily organized numerically, with the first digit generally representing
    a group of U.S. states. The zip code 48307 is in Michigan, while 01430 is in Massachusetts.
    Generally, Massachusetts is located to the northeast of Michigan, which would
    imply 01430 is north of 48307. However, zip codes themselves do not directly correlate
    to latitude or longitude, making the question potentially ambiguous if interpreted
    strictly by zip code numbering. If the question is interpreted strictly by geographic
    location, then it is clear: 48307 (Michigan) is south of 01430 (Massachusetts).
    Thus, the question may lead to different interpretations based on how one considers
    zip codes and geography.'
  - The question asks if the location corresponding to the zip code 48307 in Michigan
    is south of the location corresponding to the zip code 01430 in Massachusetts.
    This question is ambiguous for a couple of reasons. Firstly, zip codes are not
    inherently geographical in terms of north-south orientation; they are designed
    for mail delivery routes and do not follow geographical latitude lines. Secondly,
    without specific reference to the cities or areas these zip codes represent, interpreting
    "south" could be ambiguous since the zip code numbers do not correspond to geographical
    positions. Therefore, determining whether one zip code is geographically south
    of another based solely on the numbers is not possible.
  - The question is asking whether the location associated with the zip code 48307
    in Michigan is situated to the south of the location associated with the zip code
    01430 in Massachusetts. This can be interpreted in a straightforward manner by
    considering the geographical positions of these two zip codes. However, zip codes
    are not inherently geographic coordinates, and they do not provide precise north-south
    positioning relative to each other. Therefore, the question could be interpreted
    in terms of comparing the general latitude of the two locations, which could lead
    to different interpretations if the focus is not strictly on north-south positioning
    based on latitude alone. Additionally, the way zip codes are numbered does not
    reflect geographic ordering, which might add to the ambiguity if one attempts
    to interpret the question based on the numerical order of the zip codes themselves
    rather than their geographic location.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographic location of two US zip codes:
    48307 in Michigan (MI) and 01430 in Massachusetts (MA). The question seems to
    assume that zip codes can be directly compared to determine geographic location,
    which is not how zip codes work. Zip codes are primarily for postal purposes and
    do not follow a linear geographic progression from north to south or east to west.
    Therefore, determining if one zip code is "south" of another based solely on their
    numeric values is not possible. The question could be interpreted as asking for
    a comparison of geographic latitude, which requires additional geographic data
    beyond the zip code numbers. This makes the question ambiguous as it can lead
    to different interpretations and methods for determining "southness."'
  - 'The question asks whether the location of the zip code 48307 in Michigan is south
    of the location of the zip code 01430 in Massachusetts. While zip codes are often
    numerically ordered from east to west, they do not directly correlate with geographic
    latitude or directionality. Thus, the question relies on a misunderstanding of
    how zip codes relate to geographic positioning, but it can still be interpreted
    in one specific way: checking the geographic coordinates (latitude) of both zip
    codes to determine which is further south. However, the numerical order of zip
    codes does not provide enough information to answer the question accurately. Despite
    this, the question itself does not admit multiple interpretations; it only requires
    geographic knowledge to resolve. Therefore, the question is not ambiguous in terms
    of its intent, but rather in the potential for misunderstanding the relationship
    between zip codes and geography.'
  - The question is asking whether the location corresponding to the zip code 48307
    in Michigan is south of the location corresponding to the zip code 01430 in Massachusetts.
    Zip codes are numerical and based on regional postal routes rather than geographical
    latitude, so comparing them in terms of north-south positioning isn't straightforward.
    Additionally, without specific latitude and longitude data, it can be difficult
    to determine the relative geographic position based solely on zip codes. Thus,
    the question can be interpreted in multiple ways, as it does not directly relate
    to geographic coordinates but rather to postal regions.
  - 'The question involves comparing the locations of two US zip codes: 48307 in Michigan
    (MI) and 01430 in Massachusetts (MA). It asks whether 48307 is located south of
    01430. The ambiguity arises because zip codes do not inherently convey geographical
    north-south positioning. Zip codes are primarily for postal purposes and do not
    follow a strict geographical order. While one could potentially look up the latitude
    of each zip code to determine which is further south, the question as posed does
    not clarify that it expects such a geographical interpretation, nor does it specify
    the method of comparison. Additionally, without further context, it is unclear
    if the question is referring to another non-standard method of determining "south"
    based on zip codes.'
  - 'The question asks if the location associated with the zip code 48307 in Michigan
    is south of the location associated with the zip code 01430 in Massachusetts.
    While zip codes can be used to infer geographic locations, they do not follow
    a consistent north-south or east-west order. Therefore, determining whether one
    zip code is geographically south of another requires additional geographic information
    beyond just the zip codes themselves. However, the question itself is clear in
    what it is asking: it is asking for a geographic comparison based on latitude.
    There is only one interpretation of the question: determining the relative geographic
    position of two specific zip codes. The confusion or potential difficulty arises
    from the assumption that zip codes alone can provide this information, but the

    question is clear in its geographical query, as it seeks to compare the relative
    positions of two specific locations based on their zip codes. Since zip codes
    are unique and can be precisely located on a map, the question can be answered
    definitively by checking the geographical positions of these zip codes. Thus,

  - The question is asking whether the location of the zip code 07421 in New Jersey
    is south of the location of the zip code 06605 in Connecticut. While zip codes
    can be used to determine rough geographic locations, they do not correspond to
    latitude and longitude in a straightforward manner. However, based on geographic
    knowledge, it is possible to determine that New Jersey is generally south of Connecticut.
    Thus, the question can be answered with geographic reasoning, and it admits one
    clear interpretation and answer.
  - The question asks if one location (07421, NJ) is south of another (06605, CT).
    This can be interpreted in a straightforward geographical sense, referring to
    whether one zip code is geographically south of the other. However, the question
    may also lead to ambiguity due to potential confusion about the reference point
    or context, such as considering other factors like political or administrative
    boundaries. Nonetheless, since the primary interpretation is geographical, it
    primarily seeks a clear answer based on latitude. Therefore, despite minor potential
    ambiguities, the question is mostly straightforward in terms of expected interpretation
    and answer.
  - 'The question asks if a specific ZIP code in New Jersey (07421) is located south
    of a specific ZIP code in Connecticut (06605). This is a geographical query that
    relies on the relative positions of these ZIP codes. ZIP codes are numerical and
    do not inherently provide geographical information regarding north or south, so
    one would need to consult a map or geographical data to determine their relative
    positions. However, the question itself is clear in what it is asking: it seeks
    to establish a north-south relationship between two fixed points. There is only
    one interpretation of the question, and the answer can be determined through geographical
    data.'
  - The question asks whether the zip code 07421 in New Jersey is located south of
    the zip code 06605 in Connecticut. This question could be considered ambiguous
    for several reasons. Firstly, zip codes do not necessarily follow a geographical
    progression (i.e., higher or lower numbers do not indicate a particular direction
    like north or south). Secondly, the question assumes a direct correlation between
    zip code numbers and geographical location, which is not how zip codes are structured.
    Therefore, determining whether one zip code is "south" of another based solely
    on zip codes without a map or geographical data could lead to different interpretations.
    Additionally, the question could also be interpreted as asking whether the city
    or area represented by the zip code is geographically south of the other, which
    is a separate consideration from the numbers themselves.
  - The question is asking about the geographical location of two specific US zip
    codes in relation to each other, specifically whether one is located south of
    the other. Zip codes are not designed to indicate geographical location in terms
    of cardinal directions, such as north or south, but are rather used for postal
    delivery purposes. However, zip codes can often be approximately associated with
    specific geographic areas. In this case, 07421 is a zip code in New Jersey and
    06605 is a zip code in Connecticut. Generally, New Jersey is located to the south
    of Connecticut. Therefore, the question can be interpreted as asking whether the
    area associated with the New Jersey zip code is geographically south of the area
    associated with the Connecticut zip code. This interpretation leads to a clear
    answer based on the relative geographic locations of New Jersey and Connecticut.
  - The question is asking about the geographical location of two US zip codes relative
    to each other. However, zip codes do not necessarily follow a north-south geographical
    order. Therefore, the question might imply a need to compare the actual geographical
    latitude of the locations corresponding to these zip codes. Although the question
    is straightforward in its wording, the interpretation depends on understanding
    that zip codes don't inherently determine geographic positions. Nonetheless, the
    question itself does not admit multiple interpretations; it is asking for a specific
    geographical comparison, which can be answered definitively by checking a map
    or geographical data. Therefore, it is clear in its intent, even though it might
    not be straightforward due to the nature of zip codes.
  - The question asks whether a specific zip code in New Jersey (07421) is located
    south of a specific zip code in Connecticut (06605). On the surface, this question
    might seem straightforward as it involves determining the relative geographic
    locations of two zip codes. However, zip codes do not necessarily follow a strict
    geographic order or a north-south orientation, and their numbers do not directly
    correspond to geographic latitude. Additionally, without a map or geographic data,
    one might assume that all of New Jersey is south of Connecticut, which is not
    necessarily true given the irregular shapes of states and the way zip codes are
    assigned. This introduces ambiguity because without specific geographic knowledge
    or tools, the answer could vary based on assumptions about zip code numbering
    or state geography.
  - The question is asking whether a specific location in New Jersey (with the zip
    code 07421) is situated to the south of a specific location in Connecticut (with
    the zip code 06605). This question is generally clear because it refers to specific
    geographic locations that can be compared in terms of their latitude. However,
    the potential ambiguity arises from the fact that zip codes are not strictly linear
    or geographical in nature; they are more about postal routes and can sometimes
    overlap or be non-contiguous. Despite this, the primary interpretation is geographical,
    where one can determine latitude to establish a north-south relationship.

    relies on geographic locations tied to these specific zip codes, which are standardized
    and can be referenced in official postal or geographic databases. The answer is
    based on geographic data and does not allow for multiple interpretations of the
    question itself, as zip codes are fixed and each has a specific location.
  - The question is asking whether one specific zip code (01129, MA) is located south
    of another zip code (01107, MA). This question could be considered ambiguous because
    zip codes do not necessarily follow a strict geographical north-to-south order.
    Additionally, the question does not specify what is meant by "south" (e.g., the

    interpretations and answers.
  - The question asks if the zip code 01129 in Massachusetts is located south of the
    zip code 01107 in Massachusetts. Zip codes are numerical representations assigned
    to specific geographical areas for mail delivery purposes and do not inherently
    convey geographic information such as cardinal directions. While some zip codes
    may have a general geographic pattern (e.g., increasing numbers moving north to
    south), this is not consistent or reliable for determining specific directional

    the question is clear and does not lead to different interpretations.
  - The question is asking if one zip code in Massachusetts (01129) is located south
    of another zip code (01107). However, zip codes are not inherently geographical
    markers that provide directional information like latitude or longitude. While
    they often correlate with certain areas, the primary purpose of zip codes is for
    mail delivery routing, not geography. Without additional geographical data, such
    as latitude and longitude, it's not possible to definitively determine if one
    zip code is south of another based solely on the zip code numbers. Additionally,
    the question assumes that zip codes in Massachusetts will follow a strict north-south
    order based on numerical value, which is not necessarily true. Therefore, the
    question could lead to different interpretations and answers depending on how
    one approaches the relationship between zip codes and geography.
  - The question asks whether the location associated with the zip code 01129 in Massachusetts
    is south of the location associated with the zip code 01107 in Massachusetts.
    The question could be considered ambiguous because zip codes are not strictly
    geographical indicators in a north-south or east-west sense; they are often assigned
    based on postal routes and can be non-contiguous. Additionally, without specific
    geographical coordinates or a map, the relationship between the two zip codes
    isn't explicitly clear from the numbers alone. Thus, without further context or
    additional information regarding the geographical arrangement of these zip codes,
    the question could lead to different interpretations or require assumptions about
    the geographical layout.
  - The question asks whether one specific zip code in Massachusetts (01129) is located
    south of another zip code in the same state (01107). This question is asking for
    a geographical comparison based on the locations of the zip codes. Zip codes are
    specific to particular geographic areas, and their relative locations can be determined
    using a map or geographic data. Therefore, this question has a single interpretation
    and can be answered definitively by looking up the geographic locations of the
    two zip codes in question.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 01129 in Massachusetts is located south
    of the zip code 01107 in Massachusetts. The question seems to be asking for a
    geographical comparison based on zip codes. However, zip codes are not strictly
    geographic and can be non-sequential in terms of location. Without a specific
    geographic map reference, determining whether one zip code is south of another
    based solely on their numeric order is not reliable. Therefore, the interpretation
    of the question depends on whether zip codes are assumed to represent geographic
    locations or merely numeric identifiers.
  - The question asks whether the location represented by the zip code 01129 in Massachusetts
    is south of the location represented by the zip code 01107 in Massachusetts. Zip
    codes are not necessarily assigned in a geographical order, and without a specific
    mapping of these zip codes to geographic coordinates, the question could be interpreted
    as asking about a potential pattern in zip code numbering rather than actual geographic
    location. Additionally, it is not clear whether the question refers to the general
    area of the zip codes or specific points within them. Therefore, the question
    admits more than one interpretation.

    zip code 16652) is situated south of a location in Colorado (identified by the
    zip code 80526). Zip codes are numerical postal codes used for mail delivery and
    do not directly correlate to geographical latitude or cardinal directions. However,
    it is possible to determine the relative geographical positions of these locations
    based on their actual latitude coordinates. Thus, the question can be interpreted
    to mean whether the latitude of the location in Pennsylvania is lower than that
    of the location in Colorado. This interpretation is clear and direct, assuming
    the question is asking about geographical positioning based on latitude, without
    any alternative interpretations. Therefore, the question has only one interpretation
    and one correct answer based on geographical data.
  - 'The question involves comparing the geographical locations of two zip codes:
    16652 in Pennsylvania (PA) and 80526 in Colorado (CO), to determine if 16652 is
    located south of 80526. The question is asking for a directional comparison based
    on latitude, which is a clear and specific interpretation. Latitude is a numerical
    value that can be compared directly to establish which location is further south.
    There is no alternative interpretation of the question, as it does not require
    additional contextual information or assumptions beyond geographical knowledge
    of the two zip codes'' positions. Therefore, the question admits only one interpretation
    and one correct answer.'

  - The question asks whether one U.S. zip code (60478, IL) is located south of another
    (06415, CT). Zip codes are numerical identifiers for specific areas and do not
    inherently indicate geographic direction like north or south. The question could
    be interpreted as asking about geographical location in terms of latitude. However,
    zip codes are not directly related to latitude, and determining if one is south

  - The question asks if a location in Illinois (ZIP code 60478) is south of a location
    in Connecticut (ZIP code 06415). The interpretation of "south" is based on geographical
    latitude. ZIP codes are numerical identifiers that do not directly correlate to
    geographical positions, and using ZIP codes to infer north-south positions is
    not reliable. However, the question is asking for a geographical comparison, which
    only admits one interpretation based on the latitude of the specified locations.
    Thus, it can be determined if one location is geographically south of the other
    based on latitude, regardless of ZIP code numbering.
  - The question is asking whether a location in Illinois (zip code 60478) is south
    of a location in Connecticut (zip code 06415). The question might seem straightforward,
    but it is ambiguous because zip codes are not geographically ordered, and the
    numeric value of a zip code does not correspond to geographic location. Additionally,
    without specific geographic coordinates, it is unclear how to determine the relative
    positions solely based on zip codes. Thus, the question can lead to multiple interpretations

  - The question asks whether the location corresponding to the zip code 35215 in
    Alabama is south of the location corresponding to the zip code 36201 in Alabama.
    This question can be interpreted in a straightforward manner by determining the
    geographic locations of the two zip codes and comparing their latitudes. Zip code
    35215 is in Birmingham, AL, and zip code 36201 is in Anniston, AL. By checking
    their relative positions on a map, it is possible to determine which one is further
    south. This question does not admit multiple interpretations as it refers to specific
    geographic locations.
  - The question is asking whether one zip code (35215, AL) is located south of another
    zip code (36201, AL) within the state of Alabama. Zip codes are numerical and
    generally assigned in a way that may suggest geographic proximity or order. However,
    they do not always strictly adhere to latitude or longitude lines. Therefore,
    determining which zip code is located "south" of the other based solely on their
    numbers is not straightforward, as zip codes are not explicitly designed to convey
    geographic direction. Additionally, without specific geographic coordinates or
    a detailed map, the question could be interpreted in different ways. One might
    assume that a higher number means a location is further south, but this is not
    a reliable method for determining geographic location. Therefore, the question
    admits more than one interpretation regarding how to determine the relative geographic
    position of the two zip codes, leading to different potential answers.
  - The question asks if a specific zip code area (35215 in Alabama) is located south

  - The question is asking whether one specific location (zip code 35215 in Alabama)
    is located south of another specific location (zip code 36201 in Alabama). The
    question is based on geographic locations associated with U.S. zip codes, which
    have fixed positions. Since zip codes are associated with specific geographic
    areas, this question has only one interpretation regarding the relative positions
    of these two zip codes. Therefore, it admits only one correct answer based on
    the geographical data of these zip codes.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 35215 in Alabama is located south of zip
    code 36201 in Alabama. This question is clear as it pertains to a geographical

    zip codes. The interpretation of "south" in this context is straightforward, referring
    to a lower latitude. Therefore, this question admits only one interpretation and
    one correct answer based on geographical data.
  - The question is asking whether one location in Alabama, identified by the zip
    code 35215, is located south of another location identified by the zip code 36201.
    US zip codes are typically assigned based on certain geographical and logistical
    considerations, but they do not always follow a strict north-south or east-west
    order. Therefore, determining the relative geographic location of these zip codes
    based solely on their numerical order could lead to incorrect assumptions. The
    question is clear in asking for a geographic relationship based on zip codes,
    but the interpretation of "south of" depends on geographic data, not the numeric
    sequence of zip codes. Thus, while the question could be seen as clear if interpreted
    to mean using geographic tools to determine relative positions, it could also
    be seen as ambiguous if someone tries to interpret zip codes numerically. However,
    given the context of geographic location, the question is relatively clear in
    its intent.

    New York: 10021 and 11507. The question asks if one is located south of the other.
    ZIP codes generally increase numerically as you move northward, but this is not
    a strict rule, especially for adjacent or nearby areas. The ZIP code 10021 is
    in Manhattan, while 11507 is in Albertson, Long Island. Both are part of New York
    state, but without specific geographical knowledge or a map, determining which
    is south of the other based solely on ZIP codes is not straightforward. However,
    since the question specifically asks about the southern position relative to each
    other, it can be interpreted that it is asking for a geographical comparison,
    which has a definitive answer.'
  - The question is asking whether the location with the zip code 10021 is situated
    south of the location with the zip code 11507 in New York. However, zip codes
    are not inherently organized in a north-south manner, as they are based on postal
    routes and not geographical coordinates. Therefore, using zip codes alone to determine
    the relative geographic location can be misleading. Without additional context
    or geographic data, the question is ambiguous because it relies on an incorrect
    assumption about how zip codes relate to geographic directions.
  - The question is asking if one zip code in New York is located south of another
    zip code in New York. However, the question is ambiguous because zip codes are
    not inherently geographical indicators of north-south positioning. Zip codes are
    assigned based on postal routes and are not necessarily in a sequential geographical
    order. Therefore, without specific geographical data or a map, it is unclear if
    10021 is indeed south of 11507. This question could be interpreted in different
    ways depending on the criteria used to determine "south" (e.g., latitude, postal
    sorting order, etc.).
  - The question is asking if one specific zip code (10021, NY) is located south of
    another zip code (11507, NY). Zip codes are primarily used for mail delivery purposes
    and do not inherently provide geographic or directional information. Therefore,
    determining whether one zip code is "south" of another requires additional geographic
    data. While it is possible to determine the relative geographic locations of these
    specific zip codes, the question is ambiguous because it assumes zip codes can
    be directly compared in terms of cardinal directions without geographic context.
    Additionally, zip codes are not assigned based on a strict north-south pattern,
    which can lead to different interpretations of "located south." Thus, without
    additional geographic information, the question could lead to different answers
    depending on how one interprets the relation between zip codes and geographic
    location.
  - The question asks whether the location corresponding to the zip code 10021 is
    south of the location corresponding to the zip code 11507, both of which are in
    New York. The question implies a geographical comparison based on zip codes, which
    does not necessarily correlate with geographical locations since zip codes are
    primarily for postal purposes and do not follow a strict north-south or east-west
    arrangement. Therefore, the interpretation of the question can vary depending
    on whether one assumes a geographical or postal code interpretation, leading to
    potential ambiguity in determining what "south" refers to in this context.
  - The question asks whether a specific zip code (10021, NY) is located south of
    another zip code (11507, NY). Zip codes are not inherently geographic indicators
    of north-south orientation, as they are primarily used for mail delivery purposes
    and do not follow a strict geographic order. Additionally, the question does not
    specify whether it is asking about the geographic center of the zip code areas
    or a specific point within those areas. Without additional context or criteria,
    such as which points within the zip codes to compare, the question admits multiple
    interpretations regarding how to determine what "south" means in this context.
  - The question asks if the zip code 10021, NY is located south of 11507, NY. This
    question is ambiguous because zip codes are not always arranged in a strictly
    geographical manner, especially in large metropolitan areas like New York. Additionally,
    the term "south" can be interpreted differently depending on the context (e.g.,
    geographical latitude, map orientation, etc.). Therefore, there are multiple interpretations
    that could lead to different answers.
  - The question asks if one location (10021, NY) is south of another location (11507,
    NY) based on their zip codes. Zip codes do not inherently provide geographical
    information about whether one location is north or south of another. Additionally,
    zip codes are not organized in a manner that allows for geographic north-south
    determination solely based on numerical order. Therefore, the question is ambiguous
    because it relies on a faulty assumption about how zip codes correlate with geographic
    location.
  - 'The question is asking whether one zip code (10021, NY) is located south of another
    zip code (11507, NY). While zip codes can give a rough idea of location, they
    do not directly correspond to geographical coordinates such as latitude and longitude.
    Additionally, zip codes are not arranged in a north-south order, so determining
    if one is south of another is not straightforward. This question can be interpreted
    in different ways: it could be asking about the relative geographical position,
    which is not directly determinable from zip codes alone, or it could be asking
    for something else entirely based on zip code numbers. Therefore, the question
    admits more than one interpretation.'
  - The question is asking whether one location (ZIP code 10021 in New York) is situated
    geographically south of another location (ZIP code 11507 in New York). This seems
    straightforward, as it is asking for a geographical comparison between two specific
    locations based on their ZIP codes. However, ZIP codes do not necessarily follow
    a north-south geographical order, and their numbers do not inherently indicate
    geographical direction. The question could be interpreted as asking for a simple
    latitude comparison or could be asking about postal routes or service areas, which
    might not strictly align with geographical directions. Additionally, without a
    map or coordinates, there could be ambiguity in determining what is meant by "south"
    in this context. Thus, this question admits more than one interpretation, leading
    to potential differences in how one might determine or interpret the "correct"
    answer.

  - The question compares two zip codes, 90274 in California and 30332 in Georgia,
    to determine their relative geographic locations. The interpretation could focus
    on either the numerical comparison of the zip codes or the actual geographic locations.
    Numerically, 90274 is larger than 30332, but geographically, California is generally
    west of Georgia, and specific latitude information is needed to determine which
    is further south. Without additional context or criteria specifying whether the
    comparison is numerical or geographic, the question can be interpreted in multiple
    ways.
  - The question involves comparing the locations of two US zip codes, 90274 in California
    and 30332 in Georgia, to determine if one is south of the other. The question
    is asking about geographic location, which can be determined by looking at a map
    or using geographic data. There is only one correct answer based on the latitude
    of these locations. Therefore, the question admits only one interpretation and
    one correct answer.
  - The question asks whether the location associated with the zip code 90274 in California
    is south of the location associated with the zip code 30332 in Georgia. The question
    is geographically straightforward, as it involves comparing the latitude of two
    specific locations based on their zip codes. However, the ambiguity arises from
    the fact that zip codes themselves do not directly correspond to geographic coordinates.
    A zip code represents an area, and without additional context, it is unclear which
    specific point within each zip code should be used for comparison. Different interpretations
    could lead to different conclusions depending on whether one uses the central
    point, a boundary point, or another reference within each zip code area. Thus,
    the question admits more than one interpretation based on how one chooses to determine
    the location within each zip code.
  - 'The question asks whether the zip code 90274 in California is located south of
    the zip code 30332 in Georgia. The question is clear and interpretable in only
    one way: determining the relative geographical locations (specifically the latitude)
    of these two zip codes. There is only one correct answer based on the geographical
    coordinates of the zip codes, making the question clear and not subject to multiple
    interpretations.'
  - The question asks if the location with the zip code 90274 in California is south
    of the location with the zip code 30332 in Georgia. The question is clear in its
    intent and can be answered by comparing the geographical latitudes of the two
    locations. There is only one interpretation, which involves determining the relative
    positions of these two specific zip code areas on a map.
  - The question is asking whether the location represented by the zip code 90274
    in California is south of the location represented by the zip code 30332 in Georgia.
    While zip codes can provide general information about locations, they are not
    directly indicative of latitude or geographic north-south positioning. However,
    given that California is generally west of Georgia, and considering that 90274
    (Palos Verdes Estates, CA) is indeed geographically south of 30332 (Atlanta, GA),
    the question can be interpreted in a straightforward manner. The question itself
    is clear in terms of its request for a comparison of geographic positions based
    on zip codes, and typically, there is one correct geographic interpretation of
    latitude positions. Thus, the question admits one interpretation with a single
    correct answer regarding geographic south positioning.

    interpretations, as it is asking for a specific geographical relationship between
    two fixed points based on their zip codes.'
  - This question involves comparing the locations of two ZIP codes, one in California
    (90274) and one in Georgia (30332). The question is asking whether the location
    of the California ZIP code is south of the Georgia ZIP code. ZIP codes do not
    inherently contain geographic directionality (north, south, etc.), but they are
    associated with specific geographic locations. The question is straightforward
    in its interpretation as it is asking for a geographic comparison of two specific
    ZIP codes. Thus, it admits only one interpretation and one correct answer based
    on geographic data.
  - This question asks whether the location associated with the ZIP code 90274 in
    California is south of the location associated with the ZIP code 30332 in Georgia.
    ZIP codes are numerical and do not inherently contain geographic information regarding
    north-south orientation. The interpretation of "south" is based on geographic
    latitude, which can be clearly determined using a map or geographic data. Therefore,
    the question is clear in asking for a comparison of geographic latitude between
    two specific locations.

  - 'The question asks whether one zip code in Florida (33905) is located south of
    another zip code in Florida (33993). This question could be interpreted in two
    ways: it could refer to the geographical latitude (whether one location is physically
    south of the other) or it could refer to the ordering or numbering of the zip
    codes, which does not necessarily correspond to geographical positioning. Since
    zip codes do not always follow geographical logic, and the question does not specify
    whether it is asking about geographical location or numerical order, the question
    admits more than one interpretation.'
  - The question is asking whether one specific zip code (33905, FL) is located south
    of another zip code (33993, FL). The interpretation relies on the geographic locations
    of these zip codes, which are fixed and specific. There is only one way to interpret
    the location of these zip codes in relation to each other based on geographic
    data. Therefore, the question does not admit multiple interpretations.
  - 'The question asks whether the ZIP code 33905 in Florida is located south of the

    between two fixed locations.'
  - The question asks whether the zip code 33905 in Florida is located south of the
    zip code 33993 in Florida. Zip codes in the United States do not follow a strictly
    geographical order, meaning that the numerical order of zip codes does not necessarily
    correspond to their geographical positions. Therefore, without additional geographical
    information or a map, the question could be interpreted in multiple ways, leading
    to different answers based on assumptions about zip code ordering. This makes
    the question ambiguous as it relies on potentially incorrect assumptions about
    zip code geography.
  - The question asks if the location corresponding to the zip code 33905 in Florida
    is south of the location corresponding to the zip code 33993 in Florida. Zip codes
    are numerical and generally increase or decrease based on geographical location,
    but they do not strictly follow a north-south or east-west order. Therefore, determining
    whether one zip code is south of another based solely on their numbers can be
    misleading. However, if we interpret the question as asking about the geographical
    latitude of the areas associated with these zip codes, we could find a definitive
    answer by looking up the specific locations of these zip codes on a map. Thus,
    the question admits only one correct interpretation when considering geographical
    locations of zip codes.

  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographic location of two specific
    zip codes within Maine, USA: 04096 and 04062. Zip codes are numerical codes assigned
    to specific areas for mail delivery purposes. However, they do not inherently
    provide geographical information such as latitude or longitude. The question could
    be interpreted in two ways: (1) asking if the area designated by zip code 04096
    is geographically south of the area designated by 04062, or (2) asking if the
    numerical value of 04096 suggests a location south of 04062 based on any numeric
    ordering system. Without specific geographic coordinates or additional context,
    there is ambiguity in determining the relative geographic positions based solely
    on zip codes.'
  - The question asks if the location of the zip code 04096 in Maine is south of the
    location of the zip code 04062, also in Maine. Zip codes are not necessarily assigned
    in a geographical order or pattern that reflects north-south or east-west directions.
    Therefore, the question could be interpreted in different ways depending on the
    method used to determine "south of." One might interpret it based on actual geographical
    latitude, while another might mistakenly interpret it based on numerical order,
    which does not apply to geographic orientation. This leads to multiple interpretations
    and potentially different answers.
  - 'The question asks whether the location corresponding to the zip code 04096 in
    Maine (ME) is south of the location corresponding to the zip code 04062 in Maine.
    Zip codes generally do not follow a strict geographical north-to-south or east-to-west
    order, which means the numerical order of zip codes does not directly correlate
    with geographical location. Therefore, the question is asking for a geographical
    comparison based on zip codes, which could lead to different interpretations if
    someone assumes zip codes are geographically ordered. However, the question itself
    is clear in what it asks: a geographical comparison based on zip code locations.'
  - The question asks whether the zip code 04096 in Maine is located south of the
    zip code 04062 in Maine. The zip codes can be used to identify geographic locations,
    and one can determine the relative geographic positions of these locations using
    maps or geographic data. The question does not present any ambiguity in terms
    of interpretation, as it is clear that it seeks to compare the geographic positions
    of two specific zip codes in Maine.
  - The question asks if the location associated with the zip code 04096 in Maine
    (ME) is south of the location associated with the zip code 04062 in Maine. Zip
    codes are numerical and don't inherently convey geographic information about the
    north-south position of a location. The question could be interpreted as asking
    about geographic latitude, but zip codes do not necessarily follow a linear or
    geographic order. Without additional context about how zip codes are distributed
    or specific geographic knowledge, the question could be ambiguous. However, if
    interpreted strictly geographically, one could determine the latitude of each
    location and answer based on that. Therefore, while there is a possible clear
    interpretation, the lack of inherent geographic ordering in zip codes makes this
    question potentially ambiguous.
  - The question asks whether the location of one zip code in Maine (04096) is south
    of another zip code in Maine (04062). This is a straightforward geographic question
    that relies on the specific latitude positions of the two zip codes. Therefore,
    it admits only one interpretation and one correct answer based on geographic data.
  - 'The question asks whether one zip code (04096) in Maine is located south of another
    zip code (04062) in Maine. Zip codes are not assigned based on geographical latitude,
    so the question cannot be answered simply by comparing the numbers. Therefore,
    the question could be interpreted in different ways: one could attempt to answer
    it based on the numerical order of the zip codes, or one could attempt to answer
    it based on the actual geographical locations of the towns associated with these
    zip codes. Thus, the question admits more than one interpretation, leading to
    potentially different answers depending on the interpretation used.'
  - 'The question involves determining the relative location of two zip codes, 04096
    and 04062, both in Maine (ME). Zip codes are primarily for postal delivery and
    do not necessarily follow geographical north-south alignment. Therefore, the question
    could be interpreted in multiple ways: one could consider the numerical order,
    geographical location, or other criteria for "south." Since zip codes are not
    arranged strictly in geographical order, this can lead to different interpretations
    and answers based on the criteria used.'
  - The question asks whether the location with the zip code 04096 in Maine (ME) is
    south of the location with the zip code 04062 in Maine. This is a clear geographic
    question that can be answered with a specific geographic comparison based on the
    latitude of the two locations. The interpretation is straightforward as it asks
    for a comparison in the north-south direction. Therefore, it does not admit multiple
    interpretations.
  - The question is asking whether the zip code 04096 in Maine is located south of
    the zip code 04062 in Maine. While zip codes generally follow a geographical order,
    there are exceptions, and zip codes are not strictly aligned with geographical
    directions. Without specific geographical knowledge of the locations of these
    zip codes, the question could be interpreted in different ways. Additionally,
    the phrasing "located south of" could be interpreted in terms of geographical
    position or could imply a non-literal interpretation. Therefore, the question

  - The question asks if the zip code 90048 is located south of the zip code 91803
    in California. The interpretation relies on the geographical positions of these
    zip codes. Zip codes are not necessarily arranged in a north-south or east-west
    order, so determining "south" based solely on zip code numbers can be misleading.
    However, in terms of geography, 90048 is indeed located to the west and slightly
    south of 91803. Despite the potential for confusion due to the non-linear nature
    of zip code numbering, the question itself is clear as it asks for a specific
    geographical comparison between two defined locations.
  - The question is asking whether one specific zip code (90048, CA) is located south
    of another (91803, CA). The interpretation of "south" in this context could be
    straightforward if it refers strictly to geographic latitude. However, zip codes
    are not always assigned in a strictly north-to-south or east-to-west manner; they
    often follow population and delivery route considerations rather than geographic
    coordinates. Thus, determining which zip code is "south" of the other isn't straightforward
    based solely on the numbers or even their approximate geographic locations without
    a map. This introduces ambiguity, as the answer could vary based on whether one
    interprets "south" in terms of geographic latitude or some other criteria like
    postal routing. Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation regarding
    the criteria for "south."
  - 'The question is asking about the geographical location of two specific ZIP codes
    in California: 90048 and 91803. The interpretation of "south" is straightforward
    in a geographical context, meaning in the direction toward the South Pole along
    the Earth''s surface. Since ZIP codes are specific to certain areas, and their
    relative positions can be determined using maps or geographic tools, the question
    has one clear interpretation and can be answered definitively based on geographic
    data.'
  - The question is asking whether the location associated with the zip code 90048
    in California is south of the location associated with the zip code 91803 in California.
    This question is geographical and can be interpreted in one way, which involves
    determining the relative positions of these two zip codes on a map. Given that
    zip codes are fixed geographical areas, the question has one correct answer based
    on their relative locations. Therefore, the question admits only one interpretation
    and one correct answer.
  - 'The question asks about the relative location of two zip codes: 90048 and 91803
    in California. The interpretation of "located south of" is straightforward, as
    it refers to geographical positioning. Zip codes are specific identifiers for
    regions, and their locations can be precisely determined using maps. Thus, the
    question has a single interpretation and can be answered based on geographical
    data regarding the positions of these zip codes.'
  - The question asks whether the zip code 90048, which is in California, is located
    south of another zip code, 91803, also in California. The question is clear in
    its intent to determine the geographical relationship (specifically, north-south
    orientation) between two specific zip codes. Zip codes are well-defined and can
    be mapped geographically, allowing for a definitive answer. Thus, there is only
    one interpretation of the question, and it seeks a specific factual answer about
    their relative positions.
  - The question asks whether the location associated with the ZIP code 90048 in California
    is situated south of the location associated with the ZIP code 91803 in California.
    While ZIP codes generally follow a geographic pattern, they are not strictly linear
    or consistently aligned along cardinal directions like north-south. Furthermore,
    ZIP codes can represent areas that are not contiguous or have irregular shapes.
    Therefore, determining the relative geographic position of these two ZIP codes
    based solely on their numerical values or ZIP code information is not straightforward
    and could lead to different interpretations without additional geographic data
    or mapping tools. This ambiguity arises from the nature of ZIP code allocations
    and the lack of direct geographic correlation between ZIP code numbers and cardinal
    directions.
  - The question asks about the geographical location of two zip codes, 90048 and
    91803, in California. The query seems to be straightforward, as it requires determining
    the relative north-south positioning of these zip codes based on geographical
    data. Zip codes are specific to certain areas, and their locations can be clearly
    determined using mapping tools or geographical databases. Therefore, this question
    does not lend itself to multiple interpretations; it simply requires factual geographical
    information to answer whether one zip code is located south of the other.
  - The question is asking whether the location with the ZIP code 90048 in California
    is south of the location with the ZIP code 91803 in California. ZIP codes are
    generally assigned based on geographical regions, but they do not strictly follow
    a north-to-south or east-to-west order. Therefore, determining the relative geographical
    position based solely on ZIP codes can be misleading. Additionally, ZIP codes
    can have irregular shapes and do not always align with straightforward geographical
    directions. This makes the question potentially ambiguous without additional context
    or a map to confirm the relative positions. However, since ZIP codes can be mapped
    to specific coordinates, if we interpret the question as asking for a comparison
    based on latitude, then it could be considered clear with a definitive answer
    based on those coordinates.
  - The question is asking whether the location corresponding to the ZIP code 90048
    in California is south of the location corresponding to the ZIP code 91803 in
    California. The interpretation hinges on the geographical locations associated
    with these specific ZIP codes. ZIP code 90048 corresponds to an area in Los Angeles,
    while ZIP code 91803 corresponds to an area in Alhambra. Both ZIP codes have specific
    geographical locations, allowing for a straightforward determination of their
    relative positions in terms of north and south. Therefore, the question admits
    only one interpretation and one correct answer based on geographical data.

  - The question asks if the zip code 50322 in Iowa is located south of the zip code
    46761 in Indiana. Zip codes are numerical representations that do not directly
    correlate to geographic latitude or longitude. However, they are often used to

    would typically compare the geographic coordinates (latitude) of the two locations.
    The question seems to imply a straightforward geographic comparison. However,
    without specific geographic data, one cannot definitively answer if one zip code
    is south of another just based on zip codes alone. Moreover, it assumes that the
    reader knows the relative locations of these zip codes, which adds an element
    of ambiguity since the question does not provide any geographic context or data.
    Hence, there is room for interpretation regarding how one should determine "south"
    in this context.

  - The question asks if one zip code is located south of another. This requires interpreting
    the geographical relationship between two zip codes based on their latitude. Zip
    codes are not directly related to latitude or longitude, so determining if one
    zip code is geographically south of another is not straightforward. Additionally,
    the question could be interpreted in terms of numerical comparison, which does
    not correlate with geographical south. Therefore, the question admits more than
    one interpretation, which could lead to different answers.
  - 'The question asks whether a location in New Jersey, identified by the ZIP code
    07927, is located south of a location in New York, identified by the ZIP code
    10451. ZIP codes are not geographical coordinates and do not provide information
    about the relative north-south positioning of locations. Additionally, ZIP codes
    are not assigned in a strictly geographical order. Therefore, the question could
    be interpreted in two ways: (1) Is the question asking about the geographical
    north-south position of the two locations? or (2) Is it asking about the numerical
    order of the ZIP codes, which doesn''t necessarily correlate with geography? These
    different interpretations could lead to different answers, making the question
    ambiguous.'
  - The question is asking if the location of one zip code (07927, NJ) is south of
    another zip code (10451, NY). This can be interpreted in a straightforward manner
    based on geographical coordinates. However, the question does not specify what
    is meant by "south" (e.g., in terms of exact latitude comparison, regional comparison,
    etc.), which could lead to different interpretations. Additionally, zip codes
    can cover irregularly shaped areas, making a simple north-south comparison potentially
    misleading without more context.
  - The question is asking whether one zip code (07927, NJ) is located south of another
    zip code (10451, NY). While the question seems straightforward, the interpretation
    of "south" in terms of zip codes is ambiguous. Zip codes are not arranged in a
    strictly geographical manner; they are primarily used for postal purposes and
    do not necessarily correspond to cardinal directions. Additionally, determining
    "south" would require knowing the exact geographical locations of these zip codes,
    which is not provided in the question. Thus, the question admits more than one
    interpretation regarding how to determine the relative location (geographically
    or by zip code numbering), leading to potential different answers.
  - The question is asking whether one location (07927, NJ) is south of another location
    (10451, NY) based on their zip codes. The question implies a geographic interpretation,
    where "south" refers to the relative position on a map. Since zip codes do not
    inherently provide geographic orientation or latitude information, and because
    zip codes are not sequentially ordered by geography, this question could be interpreted
    in different ways. For instance, one might consider the numerical order of the
    zip codes or the actual geographic location of the areas they represent. Therefore,
    the question admits more than one interpretation, leading to different possible
    answers.
  - The question asks if the location corresponding to the zip code 07927 in New Jersey
    is south of the location corresponding to the zip code 10451 in New York. The
    question is asking for a geographical comparison based on the locations of these
    two specific zip codes. Zip codes are specific and can be pinpointed to precise
    geographical locations, thus the question has only one interpretation and can
    be answered definitively by comparing the geographical coordinates (latitude)
    of the two locations.
  - The question is asking whether the location corresponding to the zip code 07927
    in New Jersey is south of the location corresponding to the zip code 10451 in
    New York. This question assumes that zip codes can be used to determine geographical
    direction (north, south, etc.), which is not a straightforward or standard method
    of determining geographical location. Zip codes are primarily used for mail delivery
    purposes and do not necessarily follow a north-south or east-west pattern. Therefore,
    the question could be interpreted in different ways depending on how one decides
    to use zip codes to determine geographical location. This makes the question ambiguous.
  - The question is asking whether the location of the zip code 07927 in New Jersey
    is south of the zip code 10451 in New York. This is a geographical question about
    relative positions of two specific zip codes. While the question might seem straightforward,
    it is actually ambiguous because zip codes are not inherently arranged in a linear
    north-to-south or east-to-west manner. Zip codes are determined by postal routes
    and do not necessarily correlate with geographic latitude. Therefore, the interpretation
    of whether one zip code is "south" of another could vary based on different criteria
    or methods of measurement (e.g., the geographic center of the zip code area, the
    location of a particular address within the zip code, etc.).
  - 'The question involves determining the geographical location of two zip codes
    relative to each other. It specifically asks if one zip code area is located south
    of the other. The question appears to be straightforward, as it asks for a comparison
    of latitude between two specific zip codes: 07927 in New Jersey and 10451 in New
    York. There is only one interpretation of this question, which involves comparing
    the geographical latitude of these zip codes to determine which one is further
    south. There is a single correct answer based on geographical data.'
  - The question asks whether the location of the zip code 07927 in New Jersey is
    south of the location of the zip code 10451 in New York. This question seems to
    seek a geographical comparison based on latitude between two specific zip codes,
    which should have a definitive answer. The interpretation of "south of" in this
    context is clear as it pertains to geographical positioning on a north-south axis.
    Therefore, the question admits only one interpretation and one correct answer
    based on geographic data.

    involves geographical locations, which can be determined with latitude coordinates.
    However, without additional context, such as the actual latitude coordinates or
    a map, the question may require interpretation of what "south" means in this context.
    Additionally, since zip codes are not necessarily assigned based on latitude or
    geographical north-south orientation, this adds another layer of complexity. Therefore,
    there can be multiple interpretations of how to determine what is "south" based
    solely on zip codes, leading to potentially different answers depending on how
    one interprets the question. This makes the question ambiguous.

    zip codes with respect to their north-south positioning. The interpretation is
    straightforward, as it involves a simple geographic comparison based on zip codes.
    There is only one correct answer that can be determined by looking up the relative
    positions of these zip codes on a map.'
  - The question asks if one specific zip code in Washington state (99206) is located
    south of another zip code (98311). The interpretation hinges on geographical location,
    which can be objectively determined using maps or geographical data. There is
    only one correct answer based on the relative positions of these zip codes. Therefore,
    the question admits only one interpretation and one correct answer.
  - The question asks whether the location associated with the zip code 99206 in Washington
    is south of the location associated with the zip code 98311 in Washington. This
    question seems to be seeking a geographical comparison based on the numeric zip
    codes. However, zip codes are not inherently geographic indicators of north-south
    positioning. They are used for postal delivery purposes and do not always follow
    a logical geographic progression. Thus, the question may be interpreted as asking
    for a direct geographic comparison, which would require additional geographic
    data beyond the zip codes themselves. Therefore, the question could be considered
    ambiguous because it relies on an assumption about zip code sequences that may
    not apply to geographic orientation.
  - The question asks if the zip code 99206, WA is located south of 98311, WA. While
    this question may seem straightforward, it is ambiguous because it relies on the
    assumption that zip codes are organized in a geographic manner that corresponds
    directly to north-south orientation, which is not necessarily the case. Zip codes
    are primarily organized for postal delivery purposes and do not follow a strict
    geographic order. Therefore, the question can be interpreted in different ways
    based on the understanding of how zip codes correlate with geographic locations,
    leading to potential different answers.

  - The question is asking about the geographical location of two specific ZIP codes
    within Kentucky, specifically whether one is located south of the other. ZIP codes
    are typically assigned based on postal routes and do not inherently indicate geographical
    directions. Therefore, the question is unclear because ZIP codes do not correspond
    to latitude or longitude, and without additional geographical information, it
    is impossible to determine directionality based solely on ZIP code numbers. This
    leads to ambiguity as the question could be interpreted in different ways depending
    on how one views the relationship between ZIP codes and geography.
  - The question asks whether the location corresponding to the zip code 40514 in
    Kentucky is south of the location corresponding to the zip code 40517 in Kentucky.
    Zip codes are assigned based on postal routes and do not follow geographical order,
    so they do not inherently indicate north-south positioning. Without specific geographical
    data on these zip codes, the question may lead to different interpretations based
    on how one perceives zip code ordering versus actual geographical positioning.
    Therefore, the question does not have a single clear interpretation based on the
    information provided.
  - The question asks whether the location with the zip code 40514 in Kentucky is
    situated south of the location with the zip code 40517 in Kentucky. This question
    seems to seek a geographical comparison based on zip codes. Zip codes are primarily
    used for mail delivery purposes and do not always follow a geographical north-south
    pattern. Thus, using zip codes alone for geographical positioning can be misleading,
    as they do not inherently provide spatial orientation. However, if we assume the
    question is asking for a straightforward geographical comparison based on actual
    locations, then it could be determined by checking the latitude of the two locations.
    Despite this, the nature of zip codes and their distribution means there could
    be multiple interpretations (e.g., postal routes vs. actual geographical positions),
    which makes the question ambiguous.
  - The question asks whether one US zip code (40514, KY) is located south of another
    (40517, KY). This is a geographically specific question that relies on the spatial
    arrangement of zip codes. Since zip codes are numerical and not inherently indicative
    of geographic location, the question requires specific knowledge about the geographic
    placement of these zip codes. The interpretation hinges on the relative geographic
    locations of the zip codes in question, not on multiple potential meanings or
    interpretations of the question itself. Therefore, the question is clear in what
    it is asking, although answering it requires specific geographic knowledge.
  - 'The question involves determining the relative location of two US zip codes within
    Kentucky: 40514 and 40517. The question assumes that zip codes can directly indicate
    geographic orientation, which is not always the case. Zip codes are primarily
    used for mail delivery and do not necessarily follow a strict geographic order.
    Without additional geographic information or a map, it''s unclear if 40514 is
    actually south of 40517. Therefore, the question could be interpreted in multiple
    ways, depending on how one assumes zip codes relate to geographic positions.'
  - 'The question is asking if one ZIP code in Kentucky is located south of another
    ZIP code. ZIP codes are numerical identifiers for specific areas, but they do
    not inherently provide geographic information such as cardinal direction (north,
    south, etc.). Without additional geographic information or context, the numbers
    themselves do not determine relative location. Therefore, the question can be
    interpreted in different ways: as a question about the numerical order of ZIP
    codes or as a geographical query that requires mapping data to answer accurately.'
  - 'The question asks whether the zip code 40514 in Kentucky is located south of
    the zip code 40517 in Kentucky. This is a straightforward geographical question
    about the relative locations of two specific zip codes. The interpretation is
    clear: it seeks to determine the north-south orientation of two known points.
    Therefore, the question is not open to multiple interpretations as it relies on
    geographic data to provide a single correct answer.'
  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographic locations of two specific
    zip codes in Kentucky: 40514 and 40517. In terms of interpretation, the question
    is clear because it is asking for a comparison between two fixed points, which
    can be determined by geographic data. There is one interpretation: determining
    the directional location of one zip code in relation to another based on geographic
    coordinates. Hence, this question only admits one correct answer based on actual
    geographic information.'
  - 'The question asks whether the location identified by the ZIP code 40514 in Kentucky
    is south of the location identified by the ZIP code 40517 in Kentucky. ZIP codes
    are numerical identifiers for areas and do not inherently contain geographic information
    such as latitude or longitude. Therefore, determining whether one ZIP code is
    south of another based solely on their numbers is not possible. However, if there
    is a known geographic database or map that provides the exact locations of these
    ZIP codes, the question could be answered definitively. Without explicit reference
    to such a database, the question could be interpreted in multiple ways: as asking
    about the geographic location or simply about the numerical order of ZIP codes.
    This duality in potential interpretations makes the question ambiguous.'
  - 'The question is asking if the location of the zip code 40514 in Kentucky is south
    of the location of the zip code 40517 in Kentucky. While zip codes are generally
    assigned in a geographic manner, they do not always follow strict geographic directions
    such as north, south, east, or west. The interpretation here is straightforward:
    it is asking about the relative geographic location of two specific zip codes.
    However, without specific geographic or mapping data, the answer cannot be definitively
    determined just from the zip codes themselves. Despite this, the question itself
    is clear in what it is asking.'

    comparing the latitudinal positions of the two zip codes. There is only one correct
    interpretation and answer to this question: determining the relative north-south
    position of the two zip codes based on their geographical coordinates. Therefore,
    the question is clear and not open to multiple interpretations.'
  - The question involves determining whether one geographic location (27233, NC)
    is south of another (38555, TN) based on their zip codes. The interpretation of
    "south" is clear in this context, referring to the relative geographical position
    on a map. Since zip codes can be directly associated with specific geographic
    locations, there is a definitive way to determine the relative position of these
    two locations, leading to only one correct answer. Thus, the question admits only

    admits one interpretation and one correct answer based on geographical data.
  - 'The question asks whether the location of the zip code 27233 in North Carolina
    is south of the location of the zip code 38555 in Tennessee. The question can
    be interpreted in only one way: determining the geographical latitude of each
    zip code to see which is further south. Since latitude can be definitively measured,
    this question admits one interpretation and one correct answer based on geographical
    data.'
  - The question involves comparing the locations of two U.S. ZIP codes to determine
    if one is geographically south of the other. While ZIP codes are numerical identifiers
    for postal regions and can be mapped to geographic locations, they do not inherently
    convey directional information like latitude or longitude. Additionally, ZIP codes
    are not sequentially assigned based on geographic coordinates, so their numerical
    order does not imply spatial direction. Consequently, without additional geographic
    data or context, the question is ambiguous because it cannot be answered accurately
    using only the ZIP code numbers.
  - The question asks whether the location associated with the zip code 27233 in North
    Carolina is situated south of the location associated with the zip code 38555
    in Tennessee. This question is relatively straightforward as it pertains to geographical
    coordinates, which can be objectively determined. The interpretation of "south"
    in this context is based on latitude, which is a clear and measurable criterion.
  - The question asks whether the location corresponding to the US zip code 27233
    in North Carolina is situated south of the location corresponding to the zip code
    38555 in Tennessee. The interpretation relies on geographical coordinates of the
    specified zip codes, which can be determined with available data. The question
    is specific and does not allow for multiple interpretations; it simply requires
    checking the relative latitudinal positions of the two zip codes.
  - 'The question asks whether the location corresponding to the zip code 27233 in

  - The question asks whether one specific location in North Carolina (zip code 27233)
    is south of another location in Tennessee (zip code 38555). The interpretation
    hinges on geographical latitude, which is a single interpretation. The question
    is clear in its intent and requires a factual answer based on geographic data.
  - The question involves determining the geographical location of two zip codes,
    27233 in North Carolina and 38555 in Tennessee, relative to each other. It assumes
    that zip codes can be directly compared to determine geographical positions such
    as "south of." However, zip codes are not arranged in a strictly geographical
    manner, and their numbers do not directly correlate to latitude or longitude.
    Thus, interpreting whether one zip code is south of another based solely on the
    numbers is problematic. The question could be interpreted as asking for a direct
    comparison of latitude, which is not inherently clear from the zip codes themselves.
    Thus, the question is ambiguous because it relies on an interpretation of zip
    code numbers that do not inherently provide geographical positioning information.

  - The question asks whether the location of the zip code 03873 in New Hampshire
    is south of the location of the zip code 14215 in New York. While zip codes can
    be used to determine geographical locations, they are not inherently directional
    or sequential in a geographical sense. Furthermore, without specific latitude
    information, the question about which zip code is located further south is not
    directly answerable based solely on the zip codes themselves. Therefore, the question
    can be interpreted in different ways depending on whether one assumes additional
    geographical data is available or needed.
  - The question is asking whether a specific location in New Hampshire, identified
    by the zip code 03873, is located south of another specific location in New York,
    identified by the zip code 14215. The question is clear in its request for a geographic
    comparison based on latitude between two specific points. The interpretation revolves

  - The question asks whether the zip code 92025 in California is located south of
    the zip code 92029 in California. The interpretation of the question is straightforward
    as it is asking about the geographical relationship between two specific zip codes.
    Zip codes are numerical representations that correspond to specific geographic
    areas, and their relative positions can be determined using a map or geographic
    data. Therefore, the question does not admit multiple interpretations and has
    one correct answer based on geographic data.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 92025 in California is located south of
    the zip code 92029 in California. Zip codes are generally assigned geographically,
    often following a numerical order that corresponds to certain areas, but this
    is not always strictly north-south or east-west. The question assumes a geographical
    relationship based solely on the numerical order of zip codes, which may not accurately
    reflect actual geographic positioning. Additionally, zip codes can be irregular
    in shape and may not follow a strict north-to-south or south-to-north progression.
    Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation, as the numerical
    ordering of zip codes does not necessarily correspond to geographic latitude.
  - The question asks if the zip code 92025 in California is located south of the
    zip code 92029 in California. While zip codes generally progress numerically in
    a geographic pattern, they do not strictly follow a north-to-south or east-to-west
    order. Therefore, without additional geographic information, it's unclear if 92025
    is indeed south of 92029. The question assumes that a numerical difference in
    zip codes corresponds directly to a geographic direction, which is not always
    the case. This can lead to different interpretations based on how one considers
    the relationship between zip codes and geographic location.
  - 'The question is asking whether the location associated with the ZIP code 92025
    in California is situated to the south of the location associated with the ZIP
    code 92029. ZIP codes are numerical codes assigned to specific geographic areas,
    and generally, the numbers do not directly correlate with geographic north-south
    positioning. However, ZIP codes can be used to determine general locations when
    cross-referenced with a map. In this case, the question is clear as it is asking
    about the geographic relationship between two specific ZIP codes. There is only
    one interpretation: determining the relative north-south positions of these two
    locations based on their ZIP codes. Therefore, the question can be answered definitively
    by checking a map or database of ZIP code locations.'
  - The question asks whether the zip code 92025 is located south of the zip code
    92029 in California. Zip codes are primarily used for mail delivery purposes and
    do not necessarily follow a north-south geographical order. However, both 92025
    and 92029 are zip codes within Escondido, California. Generally, within a city,
    zip codes can be used to identify relative locations, and one might infer a north-south
    relationship based on local geography. However, without specific local knowledge
    or a detailed map, one cannot definitively determine the relative north-south
    positioning of these two zip codes based solely on the numbers. Therefore, the
    question may seem straightforward but actually admits multiple interpretations
    due to the lack of clear geographical correlation solely based on zip code numbers.
  - The question asks whether the location identified by the zip code 92025 in California
    is situated south of the location identified by the zip code 92029 in California.
    Zip codes are numerical codes used for mail delivery purposes and are not strictly
    ordered geographically. While zip codes in California are generally organized
    in a manner where lower numbers are found in the south and higher numbers in the
    north, this is not a strict rule and there can be exceptions. Therefore, the question
    could be interpreted as asking for a general geographic comparison based on zip
    code numbers or a specific inquiry into the actual geographic locations of these
    zip codes. Since these interpretations could lead to different answers (general
    rule vs. specific locations), the question is ambiguous.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 92025, CA is located south of the zip code
    92029, CA. This can be interpreted in a straightforward way by looking at the
    geographical locations of these zip codes. The question is clear because it refers

    their numbering is not necessarily indicative of north-south positions. However,
    the question specifically asks if 92025 is located south of 92029, which implies
    a single factual answer based on their actual geographical locations. This question
    does not have multiple interpretations or potential answers because it is asking

  - The question asks whether the location of the zip code 01611 in Massachusetts
    is south of the location of the zip code 02169 in Massachusetts. This question
    is straightforward in that it asks for a geographical comparison based on latitude,
    which only admits one correct answer. Zip codes are specific to certain areas,
    and their geographical positions can be determined using a map or geographic data.
    Therefore, the interpretation of the question is clear and does not lead to different
    answers.
  - 'The question asks whether the location with the zip code 01611 in Massachusetts
    is south of the location with the zip code 02169 in Massachusetts. Zip codes do
    not inherently provide geographical directionality, such as north or south, as
    they are primarily used for postal routing and not for indicating geographical
    positions. Thus, answering this question requires external geographic knowledge
    or resources to determine the relative positions of these locations. The question
    is clear in what it asks, as it specifies two distinct locations and asks for
    a comparison of their relative positions. There is only one interpretation of
    the question: determining the geographical direction between two specific zip
    codes in Massachusetts.'
  - 'The question is asking whether the location corresponding to the zip code 01611
    in Massachusetts is situated south of the location corresponding to the zip code
    02169 in Massachusetts. The question is straightforward and admits one interpretation:
    it requires a geographical comparison of the two locations based on their zip
    codes. The answer would involve looking up the geographical coordinates or locations
    of these zip codes and determining their relative positions. Therefore, the question
    is clear in its intent and does not allow for multiple interpretations.'
  - The question asks if one zip code (01611, MA) is located south of another zip
    code (02169, MA). Zip codes are numerical codes used for mail delivery and do
    not provide direct geographical positioning information. Therefore, determining
    whether one zip code is geographically south of another based solely on the zip
    code numbers is not possible without additional geographical data. This makes
    the question ambiguous because it relies on zip codes for geographical positioning,
    which they do not inherently provide.
  - The question is asking if the location represented by the zip code 01611 in Massachusetts
    is situated south of the location represented by the zip code 02169 in Massachusetts.
    This is a geographical query that can be answered by comparing the latitudinal
    positions of the two locations. Thus, it admits only one interpretation and a
    definitive answer based on geographical data.
  - The question asks whether a specific zip code (01611, MA) is located south of
    another zip code (02169, MA) within the state of Massachusetts. Zip codes are
    primarily used for mail delivery purposes and do not necessarily follow geographical
    or cardinal directions. Additionally, the locations of zip codes do not inherently
    indicate a north-south or east-west relationship. Therefore, without a map or
    additional geographic data, the question admits more than one interpretation regarding
    the relative locations of the two zip codes, leading to potential different answers
    depending on how the locations are determined or understood.
  - The question asks whether the location corresponding to the ZIP code 01611 in
    Massachusetts is south of the location corresponding to the ZIP code 02169 in
    Massachusetts. ZIP codes are used for postal purposes and do not directly correlate
    with geographic directions like north or south. However, both ZIP codes can be
    mapped to specific geographic locations. Therefore, the question is asking for
    a geographic comparison between two fixed points, which admits only one interpretation
    and one correct answer based on their actual geographic coordinates.
  - The question is asking whether one location, identified by the zip code 01611
    in Massachusetts, is located south of another location, identified by the zip
    code 02169 in Massachusetts. The question is straightforward in its request for
    a geographical comparison based on latitude. However, zip codes do not necessarily
    follow a linear geographic order, and the zip code itself does not inherently
    provide geographic information about north-south positioning. Despite this, given
    that the question specifies a comparison within Massachusetts, it can be interpreted
    clearly as asking for a geographical location comparison based on the general
    knowledge of where these zip codes are situated. Therefore, the question admits
    only one interpretation and has a correct answer based on the actual geographic
    locations of the zip codes.
  - The question asks whether the location of one US zip code (01611, MA) is south
    of another (02169, MA). While zip codes can give a rough indication of geographic
    areas, they are not strictly organized in a north-to-south manner, and thus do
    not directly correspond to geographic direction. However, given that zip codes
    are typically used to identify specific areas, the question can be interpreted
    as inquiring about the relative geographic locations of the two areas represented
    by these zip codes. This does not inherently lead to multiple interpretations
    of the question itself, as it seeks a specific geographic comparison. Therefore,
    the question is asking for a factual answer based on geographic data, which is
    a clear request for information.
  - The question asks whether the location identified by the zip code 01611 in Massachusetts
    is situated south of the location identified by the zip code 02169 in Massachusetts.
    This question relies on geographical information about the relative positions
    of these two zip codes. The question is clear in its intent, as it seeks to determine
    the north-south relationship between two specific locations. Zip codes are fixed
    geographical entities, and their relative positions can be determined using a
    map or geographical data. Thus, the question has a single interpretation and a
    single correct answer based on geographical data.

  - The question asks whether the location represented by the zip code 29640 in South
    Carolina is situated south of the location represented by the zip code 29730,
    also in South Carolina. The interpretation hinges on the geographical locations
    of these zip codes. Zip codes are not always sequential in terms of geography,
    meaning that a higher or lower number does not necessarily indicate a location
    further north or south. Therefore, determining the relative southward position
    requires specific knowledge of the geographic locations corresponding to these
    zip codes. However, the question itself is clear in its request for a geographical
    comparison based on latitude.
  - 'The question asks whether a specific location (29640, SC) is south of another
    location (29730, SC) based on their ZIP codes. ZIP codes do not inherently provide
    geographic information about latitude or cardinal direction. Therefore, the question
    could be interpreted in two ways: (1) literally asking for the geographic direction
    between these two locations, or (2) mistakenly assuming that ZIP codes indicate
    geographic direction. These interpretations could lead to different answers, making
    the question ambiguous.'
  - The question asks whether the location of one zip code (29640, SC) is south of
    another zip code (29730, SC). The interpretation is straightforward as it involves
