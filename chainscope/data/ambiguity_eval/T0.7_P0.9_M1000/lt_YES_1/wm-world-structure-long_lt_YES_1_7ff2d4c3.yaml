  - The question asks about the geographical location of Munmorah Power Station in
    relation to the Hunter Expressway. The question is specific and seeks a factual
    answer based on geographic data. However, the interpretation hinges on the definitions
    of "west" and the specific locations of both the power station and the expressway.
    Depending on the exact points considered for the expressway and the power station,
    the answer could differ. This introduces ambiguity in the interpretation of "located
    west of." Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation, leading
    to potential different answers.
  - The question asks about the geographical location of Munmorah Power Station in
    relation to the Hunter Expressway. The terms used, such as "west of," are clear
    and specific in a geographical context. However, the question is ambiguous because
    it assumes a specific reference point for "west" without clarifying from which
    point along the Hunter Expressway the direction should be considered. The Hunter
    Expressway spans a considerable distance, and without a clear starting point,
    the interpretation of "west" can vary. Therefore, the question can lead to different
    answers depending on the chosen reference point.
  - 'The question asks about the geographical location of Munmorah Power Station in

    clear starting or reference point, determining whether the power station is west
    of any point on the expressway is ambiguous. Therefore, the question could lead
    to different interpretations based on how one defines the reference point along
    the expressway.

  - The question asks about the relative location of "Langer Eugen" in relation to
    "Under (restaurant)." The ambiguity arises from the lack of specificity regarding
    which "Under (restaurant)" is being referenced, as there could be multiple restaurants
    with similar names worldwide. Without clear context or additional information
    about the specific restaurant, the question can lead to different interpretations
    and answers depending on which "Under (restaurant)" is considered.
  - The question is ambiguous because it references two specific locations, Langer
    Eugen and Under (restaurant), without providing sufficient context to clearly
    identify these places. Langer Eugen is a well-known building in Bonn, Germany,
    but "Under (restaurant)" is not specific enough to identify a unique location,
    as there could be multiple restaurants with similar names worldwide. Without additional
    context, such as the specific location of "Under," the question admits multiple
    interpretations and could lead to different answers depending on which "Under"
    is being considered.
  - The question asks about the geographical location of Langer Eugen in relation
    to a place referred to as "Under (restaurant)." The term "Under (restaurant)"
    is ambiguous because it is not specific enough to identify a single, well-known
    location. There could be multiple restaurants with similar names or the term could
    refer to an informal or lesser-known name of a restaurant. Without additional
    context or clarification on the exact location of "Under (restaurant)," the question
    admits more than one interpretation, leading to different possible answers.
  - The question asks about the location of Langer Eugen relative to a place called
    "Under" which is identified as a restaurant. The ambiguity arises from the lack
    of clear information about where "Under" is located, as "Under" could refer to
    any restaurant with that name anywhere in the world. Without a specific location
    for "Under," it is impossible to determine the relative position of Langer Eugen,
    which makes the question ambiguous.
  - The question is asking about the relative location of Langer Eugen in relation
    to "Under (restaurant)." However, the term "Under (restaurant)" is ambiguous because
    it does not specify which restaurant named "Under" is being referred to, and "Under"
    could potentially be part of a longer name or a nickname. Additionally, without
    specific geographic coordinates or additional context, it is impossible to determine
    if Langer Eugen is indeed located west of the intended "Under (restaurant)." This
    ambiguity means the question could lead to different interpretations and answers
    depending on the specific location in question.
  - The question "Is Langer Eugen located west of Under (restaurant)?" is ambiguous.
    This is because it requires knowledge of specific locations and their relative
    positions, but it does not provide sufficient context to determine which "Under
    (restaurant)" is being referred to. There could be multiple restaurants named
    "Under," and without additional information about which specific restaurant is
    meant, the question admits more than one interpretation. Consequently, it could
    lead to different answers depending on the location of the "Under" restaurant
    being considered.
  - The question is ambiguous due to the lack of context and specificity regarding
    the locations mentioned. "Langer Eugen" is a specific building in Bonn, Germany,
    but "Under (restaurant)" is not a well-defined location and could refer to any
    number of places with similar names. Without additional context or information
    about the specific "Under (restaurant)" being referenced, it is impossible to
    determine the relative location of Langer Eugen in relation to it. This lack of
    specificity leads to multiple possible interpretations and answers, depending
    on which "Under (restaurant)" is considered.
  - The question is asking about the relative location of Langer Eugen in relation
    to "Under (restaurant)." However, it is unclear what "Under (restaurant)" refers
    to, as there is no widely recognized restaurant by that exact name. This ambiguity
    in the reference point makes it difficult to determine the correct answer because
    there could be multiple interpretations of what "Under (restaurant)" is. Without
    a specific and identifiable location for the restaurant, the question can lead
    to different answers based on various interpretations of the reference point.
  - The question asks about the location of "Langer Eugen" in relation to "Under (restaurant)."
    The ambiguity arises from the lack of specific context or details about "Under
    (restaurant)." "Under" is a common word and could refer to various restaurants
    globally, leading to multiple interpretations and potential answers. Without additional
    context to clarify which "Under" restaurant is being referenced, the question
    remains ambiguous.
  - The question refers to the location of "Langer Eugen" in relation to "Under (restaurant)."
    However, without additional context, it's unclear which "Under" restaurant is
    being referred to, as there could be multiple restaurants with that name around
    the world. Additionally, "Langer Eugen" is a specific building located in Bonn,
    Germany, but the question does not specify if it's comparing to a specific "Under"
    restaurant known to be near Bonn or elsewhere. The lack of precise context about
    the "Under (restaurant)" makes the question ambiguous, as the answer depends on
    which "Under" restaurant is being considered.

  - The question asks if Maison Alcan is located west of YUL Condos. This requires
    specific geographic knowledge about the relative locations of these two places.
    The question is clear in its request for a directional relationship between two
    specific locations. Assuming there is a definitive answer based on their actual
    geographic positions, the question is clear and admits only one correct interpretation
    and answer.
  - The question "Is Maison Alcan located west of YUL Condos?" is asking about the
    relative geographical position of two specific locations, Maison Alcan and YUL
    Condos. The interpretation depends on the precise geographical coordinates or
    maps that clearly establish the positions of these locations. If these locations
    are well-documented with respect to their positions, then the question has one
    correct answer. However, if there is ambiguity in the exact positioning or if
    there are multiple buildings with similar names in different locations, it could
    lead to different interpretations. Without additional context, such as knowing
    the exact cities or areas these buildings are located in, the question could be
    considered ambiguous because it could refer to different geographical locations
    with similar names.
  - The question asks about the location of Maison Alcan in relation to YUL Condos.
    The question's interpretation depends on the specific locations of these two buildings.
    If the locations of Maison Alcan and YUL Condos are well-documented and known,
    then the question has one clear interpretation and one correct answer. However,
    if there is any uncertainty or multiple locations for either building, it could
    lead to different interpretations. Assuming typical geographical knowledge and
    that both locations are distinct and known entities, the question can be considered
    clear.
  - The question asks whether Maison Alcan is located west of YUL Condos. This requires
    geographic knowledge of the locations of both Maison Alcan and YUL Condos. The
    question is specific in its inquiry about the relative positioning (west) of two
    distinct locations, which typically allows for a straightforward interpretation
    based on a map or geographic data. However, the potential ambiguity arises from
    the fact that "west" can be interpreted in different ways depending on the reference
    point or scale used (e.g., street level, city level), and without specific coordinates
    or a map, the interpretation could vary. Nonetheless, the primary interpretation
    is based on geographic positioning, which tends to have a definitive answer once
    the scale is set. Therefore, the question is primarily clear in its intent, but
    it could be slightly ambiguous without additional context such as the scale or
    specific map reference.
  - The question asks about the relative location of Maison Alcan in relation to YUL
    Condos. However, it does not specify the city or provide any context for what
    "YUL Condos" refers to. "YUL" could be associated with several different places,
    notably Montreal's airport code, but without additional context, the specific
    YUL Condos being referred to is unclear. This lack of specificity means the question
    could be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the location of the YUL Condos
    being referenced.
  - The question asks about the relative location of Maison Alcan in relation to YUL
    Condos, specifically whether Maison Alcan is located west of YUL Condos. To answer
    this question clearly, one would need specific geographical knowledge about the
    locations of both Maison Alcan and YUL Condos. The question assumes a specific
    understanding of what "west" means in this context, but does not provide any additional
    context that might lead to multiple interpretations of the question itself. Thus,
    the question is seeking a factual, geographically-based answer without room for
    multiple interpretations.
  - The question asks about the relative location of Maison Alcan in relation to YUL
    Condos. It is a straightforward question seeking a geographic comparison between
    two specific locations. Assuming both locations are known and fixed, the question
    seeks a single piece of factual information regarding their spatial relationship.
    Therefore, there is only one correct interpretation and answer to this question,
    as it involves comparing their coordinates or known positions in Montreal, Canada.
  - The question asks about the relative location of Maison Alcan and YUL Condos,
    implying a directional query. However, the clarity of the question hinges on whether
    there is a commonly accepted reference point or map that defines what "west" means
    in this context. Without specific geographic coordinates or a map reference, "west"
    could be interpreted differently, leading to potential ambiguity in the answer.
    Additionally, the current existence or recognition of these structures could affect
    the interpretation, but assuming they are known locations, the primary ambiguity
    lies in the interpretation of "west" without a clear reference point.
  - The question asks about the relative location of Maison Alcan in relation to YUL
    Condos, specifically if it is located to the west. On the surface, this seems
    straightforward. However, the ambiguity arises because the question does not specify
    which "YUL Condos" it refers to, as there could be multiple developments with
    similar names. Additionally, the question assumes a specific geographic context
    without providing details, such as the city or country, which could lead to different
    interpretations if multiple locations with these names exist. Therefore, the question
    admits more than one interpretation, leading to potential confusion or differing
    answers depending on the assumed context.
  - 'The question is asking about the geographical relationship between two specific
    locations: Maison Alcan and YUL Condos. The inquiry is whether Maison Alcan is
    located to the west of YUL Condos. This is a straightforward question about spatial

    interpretation and answer to this question based on geographical facts.
  - "The question asks whether the Tianjin Modern City Office Tower is located west\
    \ of the Great Wall of China. The question seems to be straightforward, as it\
    \ pertains to the geographical location of one specific structure relative to\
    \ another. However, there are two potential points of ambiguity: \n\n1. The term\
    \ \"west of the Great Wall of China\" could be interpreted in different ways depending\
    \ on which specific section of the Great Wall is being referred to, as the Great\
    \ Wall extends over a vast area with various sections running in different directions.\
    \ \n\n2. The question does not specify which part of the Tianjin Modern City Office\
    \ Tower's location should be considered (e.g., its entrance, center, or any other\
    \ specific point), although this is a minor detail compared to the first point.\n\
    \nDue to the lack of specificity regarding which section of the Great Wall is\
    \ being referenced, the question could be interpreted in multiple ways, leading\
    \ to different answers. Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation."
  - The question asks whether the Tianjin Modern City Office Tower is located west
    of the Great Wall of China. This is a geographical question that can be answered
    by determining the relative locations of the two landmarks. The Great Wall of
    China extends across northern China, and Tianjin is a city located to the east
    of the main sections of the Great Wall. Therefore, the question is asking for
    a straightforward geographical comparison, which only admits one interpretation
    and one correct answer.
  - The question asks if the Tianjin Modern City Office Tower is located west of the
    Great Wall of China. This question is ambiguous because the Great Wall of China
    spans a considerable distance across northern China, and "west of the Great Wall"
    could refer to any point along the wall's length. Additionally, the question does
    not specify a particular section of the Great Wall for reference, making it unclear
    which "west" is being asked about. Therefore, there could be multiple interpretations
    of which specific location along the Great Wall is being considered, leading to
    different potential answers.
  - 'The question asks whether the Tianjin Modern City Office Tower is located west
    of the Great Wall of China. This question could potentially be interpreted in
    different ways due to the following reasons:

    1. The Great Wall of China is a vast structure stretching across northern China,
    so the reference point on the Great Wall isn''t specified. This could lead to
    different interpretations of what "west of the Great Wall" means.

    2. The location of the Tianjin Modern City Office Tower in relation to various
    points along the Great Wall could yield different answers.


    Because the question lacks specificity about the reference point on the Great
    Wall, it can be interpreted in multiple ways, leading to different conclusions
    about the relative locations.'
  - The question asks about the geographical location of the Tianjin Modern City Office
    Tower in relation to the Great Wall of China. This question is relatively straightforward

  - The question asks about the geographical location of the Garissa Solar Power Station
    in relation to the Rostov State Musical Theater. The question is structured to
    determine whether one location is west of another. However, the question does
    not specify which Rostov State Musical Theater is being referred to, as there
    could be multiple theaters with similar names in different locations. This lack
    of specificity introduces ambiguity because the answer could differ depending
    on which theater is being considered. Additionally, the question does not provide
    any context or additional details that could clarify the specific locations being
    compared.
  - The question asks about the relative location of the Garissa Solar Power Station
    in relation to the Rostov State Musical Theater. This is a geographically based
    question that depends on the fixed locations of the two places. Garissa Solar
    Power Station is located in Kenya, while Rostov State Musical Theater is in Rostov-on-Don,
    Russia. Since Kenya is geographically located to the south and slightly west of
    Russia, the question can be interpreted in terms of general world geography. However,
    given the global scale, "west" might not strictly apply without further context
    (such as a specific map projection or scale). Despite this potential for different
    interpretations of "west," the inherent locations of these places in their respective
    countries allow for a straightforward answer based on a standard world map. Therefore,
    the question has a clear interpretation based on geographical coordinates, making
    it unlikely to lead to different answers when interpreted in a common geographic
    context.

    and the Rostov State Musical Theater. This question can be interpreted in a straightforward
    manner by examining a map to determine the geographical positions of both locations
    and assessing if one is west of the other. However, the question is ambiguous
    because it doesn't specify the context or the frame of reference for "west." For
    example, it could be interpreted as whether Garissa Solar Power Station is west
    relative to a specific point on the globe, or it could be asking about something
    else entirely due to the broad category "world structures." Additionally, the
    locations are very far apart, which could imply that the question is not about
    immediate proximity, making the intent unclear.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative location of two specific places: Garissa
    Solar Power Station and Rostov State Musical Theater. The interpretation hinges
    on geographic positioning. While it seems straightforward, the question assumes
    that the reader has knowledge about the locations of both places and can determine
    their relative positions. The potential ambiguity arises from the lack of context
    or specificity about the criteria for "west" (e.g., are we considering a direct
    line on a map, or are we considering the shortest travel path?). However, in terms
    of geographic location, there is a factual answer to whether one is west of the
    other based on longitude. Thus, the question admits one interpretation based on
    geographical coordinates.'

  - The question "Is White House (plantation) located west of AFI Silver?" is ambiguous
    due to the unclear reference to "White House (plantation)." There are multiple
    entities that could be referred to as "White House" or "plantation," and without
    additional context, it is unclear which specific location is being referenced.
    Furthermore, "AFI Silver" is a specific theater in Silver Spring, Maryland, but
    without knowing which "White House (plantation)" is meant, the question admits
    more than one interpretation and could lead to different answers depending on
    the intended location.
  - The question refers to "White House (plantation)" and "AFI Silver," but it is
    unclear which specific locations are being referenced. "White House" commonly
    refers to the residence of the U.S. President in Washington, D.C., but the addition
    of "(plantation)" suggests a different meaning, possibly a historical site or
    a different location entirely. Additionally, "AFI Silver" likely refers to the
    AFI Silver Theatre and Cultural Center in Silver Spring, Maryland, but without
    specific clarification, it could be another entity. The ambiguity in identifying
    the precise locations makes the question open to multiple interpretations, leading
    to different possible answers depending on the intended meaning of "White House
    (plantation)." Therefore, the question is ambiguous.
  - The question asks about the location of "White House (plantation)" in relation
    to "AFI Silver," which introduces ambiguity. The term "White House (plantation)"
    is unclear because it could refer to a specific historical plantation named "White
    House," or it could be mistakenly referring to the White House in Washington,
    D.C. Additionally, "AFI Silver" likely refers to the AFI Silver Theatre and Cultural
    Center, but without explicit clarification, it could be interpreted differently.
    The question's lack of specificity about these locations leads to multiple interpretations
    and potential answers.
  - The question refers to the location of "White House (plantation)" relative to
    "AFI Silver." The ambiguity arises because "White House" and "plantation" could
    refer to multiple entities or locations, and without additional context, it's
    unclear which specific "White House" or "plantation" is being referenced. Furthermore,
    "AFI Silver" is a specific location (likely referring to the AFI Silver Theatre
    and Cultural Center in Silver Spring, Maryland), but the lack of clarity regarding
    the "White House (plantation)" makes the question open to multiple interpretations.
  - The question refers to "White House (plantation)" and asks if it is located west
    of "AFI Silver." However, it is ambiguous because "White House" could refer to
    multiple things, such as the White House in Washington, D.C., or a specific plantation
    named "White House." Additionally, "AFI Silver" is a specific location (a theater
    in Silver Spring, Maryland), but without clear context or specific geographic
    names for "White House (plantation)," the interpretation could vary. The lack
    of precise identifiers for "White House (plantation)" makes it difficult to provide
    a definitive answer based on the information given.
  - The question asks about the location of "White House (plantation)" relative to
    "AFI Silver." The term "White House (plantation)" could refer to a specific location
    or a metaphorical/fictional place, and without additional context, it is unclear
    what is meant. Additionally, there is no widely known "White House (plantation),"
    and the question does not specify a city or region, making it difficult to determine
    the exact locations being referred to. Therefore, the question is open to multiple
    interpretations regarding what "White House (plantation)" and "AFI Silver" might
    refer to, leading to different possible answers.
  - The question asks about the location of "White House (plantation)" in relation
    to "AFI Silver." The reference to "White House (plantation)" is ambiguous because
    it is not clear what specific location or structure this refers to, as "White
    House" typically refers to the residence of the U.S. President in Washington,
    D.C., which is not commonly associated with the term "plantation." Additionally,
    without further context or clarification, it is unclear whether "AFI Silver" refers
    to a specific location that can be directly compared in terms of geographic direction.
    This leads to multiple possible interpretations of what the question is referring
    to, resulting in potential different answers based on those interpretations.
  - The question asks about the location of "White House (plantation)" in relation
    to "AFI Silver." However, there is ambiguity in the term "White House (plantation)"
    as it could refer to multiple entities or locations. The White House is a well-known
    building in Washington, D.C., but the inclusion of "(plantation)" suggests it
    might refer to a different place, perhaps a plantation named "White House." Without
    clear context or additional information, it is unclear which specific location
    is being referenced. Furthermore, the question does not specify a particular geographic
    region or context in which to interpret "west," adding to the ambiguity.
  - The question is asking for the geographic location of "White House (plantation)"
    in relation to "AFI Silver." The phrase "White House (plantation)" could refer
    to a specific historical site or a lesser-known location, and without additional
    context, it is unclear exactly which "White House (plantation)" is being referred
    to. Additionally, "AFI Silver" likely refers to the AFI Silver Theatre and Cultural
    Center in Silver Spring, Maryland. However, due to the ambiguity surrounding the
    specific "White House (plantation)" in question, this leads to multiple possible
    interpretations and potential answers, as there could be multiple places named
    "White House" that could fit the description depending on context.
  - "The question asks about the location of \"White House (plantation)\" relative\
    \ to \"AFI Silver.\" There are several ambiguities in this question: \n1. \"White\
    \ House (plantation)\" could refer to multiple things, such as a specific historical\
    \ site, a colloquial reference, or a completely different place depending on the\
    \ context or region.\n2. \"AFI Silver\" typically refers to a theater in Silver\
    \ Spring, Maryland, but without specific context, it could also be misinterpreted\
    \ as something else.\nDue to these ambiguities, the question admits more than\
    \ one interpretation, leading to potential different answers based on the assumptions\
    \ made about the locations mentioned."

    being referred to, there can be multiple interpretations. Additionally, the question
    does not specify the criteria for determining "west" (e.g., using a specific map
    projection or coordinate system), which could further lead to different answers.
  - The question asks whether a specific building, Altitude, is located west of the
    Sri Lankan Parliament Building. However, there is ambiguity because it is unclear
    what "Altitude (building)" refers to. Without a specific and universally recognized
    building name or location for "Altitude," it could be interpreted in different
    ways, leading to different answers. Additionally, the term "west" could be relative,
    depending on the scale of the map or the specific point of reference used. Therefore,
    the question admits more than one interpretation.
  - The question asks about the location of a specific building, Altitude, in relation

    of the building in question.
  - The question asks about the relative location of a specific building, Altitude,
    in relation to the Sri Lankan Parliament Building. To classify it, we need to
    determine whether the question admits multiple interpretations. The question is
    specific, asking whether one building is located west of another. However, it
    lacks context about which "Altitude (building)" is being referred to, as there
    could be multiple buildings named "Altitude" in different parts of the world.
    Without additional context to identify the specific "Altitude (building)" in question,
    it is ambiguous and could lead to different answers based on different interpretations
    of which building is meant.
  - The question is asking whether a specific building, Altitude, is located west
    of the Sri Lankan Parliament Building. However, the question is ambiguous because
    it assumes there is a single, universally recognized "Altitude (building)" without
    specifying the city or context. There could be multiple buildings with similar
    names in different locations, and without additional context, it's unclear which
    building is being referred to. This ambiguity in the identification of "Altitude
    (building)" leads to different potential interpretations and answers.
  - The question is asking about the geographical location of a specific building,
    "Altitude (building)," in relation to another known landmark, the Sri Lankan Parliament
    Building. The inquiry is straightforward and seeks a specific directional relationship
    between two distinct locations. However, the question assumes that the "Altitude
    (building)" is a recognized or specific building, which may not be universally
    known or identifiable without additional context. If "Altitude (building)" refers
    to a well-known structure, the question would be clear; otherwise, it might be
    ambiguous due to the lack of clarity on what "Altitude (building)" refers to.
  - The question asks about the location of a specific building, Altitude, in relation
    to the Sri Lankan Parliament Building. The query is straightforward in its request
    for geographical orientation. However, the question might be considered ambiguous
    because it assumes the existence of a building named "Altitude" without providing
    additional context or details about its location. If multiple buildings or structures
    could be referred to as "Altitude," this could lead to different interpretations
    and answers. Additionally, without more context, it is unclear if "Altitude" is
    a commonly known landmark or building, which could further contribute to ambiguity.

  - The question asks if Mthatha Dam is located west of Moldova National Opera Ballet.
    While the question seems straightforward, it involves geographical locations that
    are not commonly compared, leading to potential ambiguity in interpretation. The
    question does not specify a particular reference system or context for the comparison.
    Moreover, the entities involved (Mthatha Dam and Moldova National Opera Ballet)
    are located in entirely different parts of the world (South Africa and Moldova,
    respectively). The question could be interpreted in terms of a global map or a
    specific regional map, which might influence the interpretation of "west." However,
    given a global map context, there is a clear answer regarding their relative positions.
    Thus, despite the unusual nature of the comparison, there is only one correct
    interpretation in the global geographical context.
  - The question asks if Mthatha Dam is located west of Moldova National Opera Ballet.
    This question can be classified as AMBIGUOUS because it involves geographic locations
    that might not be directly related or commonly compared. The question does not
    specify the context or scale (e.g., local, national, or global) of "west," which
    could lead to different interpretations. Additionally, Mthatha Dam and Moldova
    National Opera Ballet are in different countries and vastly different regions
    (South Africa and Moldova, respectively), making the question contextually unclear
    without additional information.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographical locations of two places:
    Mthatha Dam and Moldova National Opera Ballet. However, these two places are in

    and Moldova National Opera Ballet located in Moldova, Europe. The interpretation
    of "west" is straightforward in terms of global geography, as it refers to the
    standard cardinal direction. Therefore, the question is clear as it admits only
    one interpretation regarding the relative positions of these two places on the
    globe.'
  - The question asks about the relative location of Mthatha Dam and Moldova National
    Opera Ballet. The interpretation hinges on geographical locations, which can be
    determined with precise coordinates. Mthatha Dam is located in South Africa, while

    Dam is west of the Moldova National Opera Ballet. This question admits only one
    interpretation and one correct answer based on geographic coordinates.'
  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographic locations of Mthatha Dam
    and Moldova National Opera Ballet. However, the question is ambiguous due to several
    reasons:

    1. It assumes knowledge of the specific locations of both places, which may not
    be common knowledge.

    2. The term "west" could be interpreted in different ways depending on the reference
    point and scale (e.g., directly west on a local map vs. generally west on a global
    scale).

    3. Without specifying the exact coordinates or a detailed map, it is difficult
    to determine the precise directional relationship between these two locations.

    4. The question could be interpreted as asking for either a broad directional
    sense or a precise longitudinal comparison.


    Due to these potential interpretations and the lack of specificity, the question
    admits more than one interpretation, which could lead to different answers.'

  - The question asks if the Asan Barrage is located west of Mustafa Castle. The question
    assumes that both locations are known and identifiable, and that their geographical
    relationship can be determined. However, it does not specify where Mustafa Castle
    is, nor does it provide any contextual information to ascertain which specific
    structures these might be if they share names with other locations. This lack
    of specificity in identifying the exact locations can lead to multiple interpretations,
    as there could be more than one Asan Barrage or Mustafa Castle. Without additional
    context, different interpretations could lead to different answers.
  - The question asks about the relative location of Asan Barrage in relation to Mustafa
    Castle. The question is clear in that it seeks a specific geographic orientation

    or maps used. Nonetheless, the question itself is straightforward and asks for
    a clear directional relationship.
  - The question asks about the relative location of Asan Barrage in relation to Mustafa
    Castle. While it seems to inquire about geographical positioning, the ambiguity
    arises from the lack of context about which Asan Barrage and Mustafa Castle are
    being referenced, as there might be multiple places with these names. Without
    specific context or additional information to clearly identify these locations,
    the question can lead to different interpretations depending on which Asan Barrage
    or Mustafa Castle is being considered.
  - The question asks about the relative geographical location of Asan Barrage in
    relation to Mustafa Castle. For this question to be classified as CLEAR, it must
    be established that there is only one interpretation of the question regarding
    the specific locations of Asan Barrage and Mustafa Castle. If both are well-known
    landmarks with fixed, widely-recognized locations, then the question is CLEAR.
    However, if there are multiple locations known as Asan Barrage or Mustafa Castle,
    or if there is insufficient information about their locations relative to each
    other, the question could be interpreted in different ways, making it AMBIGUOUS.
  - The question asks about the geographical location of the Asan Barrage in relation

    coordinates. If either location could refer to multiple places or if there is
    any uncertainty about the specific locations being referenced, the question would
    be AMBIGUOUS. Without additional context or specific geographical references,
    the question may be interpreted differently depending on which Asan Barrage or
    Mustafa Castle is being considered.

    the relative geographical locations of the two landmarks to establish if one is
    west of the other.
  - The question asks about the relative location of Asan Barrage in relation to Mustafa
    Castle. This question is potentially ambiguous because it assumes the existence
    of a clear reference point or shared understanding of where these structures are
    located without providing specific details. Without additional context or a universally
    accepted reference map, there can be multiple interpretations of what "west" might
    mean, especially if there are different locations named Mustafa Castle or if the
    orientation is not specified. Therefore, the question may lead to different answers
    based on different assumptions or interpretations of the locations involved.

    known locations in Toronto, Canada. The direction "west" is also clear. However,
    the question could be ambiguous if there are multiple buildings called the "Merchandise
    Building" in different locations, or if there is uncertainty about what is meant
    by "west" (e.g., if the context of "west" is not clear or if it requires a precise
    geographical calculation). Additionally, if there is no specific context provided
    about which "Merchandise Building" is being referenced, it can lead to different
    interpretations and answers. Therefore, without additional context, the question
    can be considered ambiguous.
  - The question is asking whether the Merchandise Building is located west of One
    Yonge Street. This is a geographical question that could be answered with a map
    or directional data. The Merchandise Building and One Yonge Street are specific
    locations in Toronto, Canada. Since the question is straightforward and is asking
    for a specific directional relationship between two known points, it only admits
    one interpretation and one correct answer based on geographical facts.
  - 'The question asks about the geographical relationship between two specific locations:
    Merchandise Building and One Yonge Street. The question is specific and seeks
    a straightforward yes or no answer based on the geographical data of these two
    locations. There is no ambiguity in the terms used or the context of the question,
    as it pertains directly to the spatial orientation of one building in relation
    to another. Therefore, the question only admits one interpretation and one correct
    answer based on factual information.'
