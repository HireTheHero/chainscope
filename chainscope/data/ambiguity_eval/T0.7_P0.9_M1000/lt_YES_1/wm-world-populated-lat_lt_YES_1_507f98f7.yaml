  - The question asks whether Vulcano is located south of Amarynthos. To determine
    if the question is clear or ambiguous, we need to consider if there is only one
    interpretation of the locations mentioned. Vulcano is an island in Italy, part
    of the Aeolian Islands in the Tyrrhenian Sea. Amarynthos is a town in Greece.
    Given these specific locations, the question is asking for a geographical comparison
    that admits one correct answer based on their fixed positions on a map. Therefore,
    the question is clear as it refers to specific, identifiable places with a single
    interpretation.
  - The question asks about the relative location of Vulcano in relation to Amarynthos.
    However, there is ambiguity because "Vulcano" could refer to multiple places.
    For example, it could refer to Vulcano, the island in Italy, or any other location
    with a similar name. Similarly, "Amarynthos" could refer to a specific place in
    Greece or elsewhere. Without specifying which Vulcano and which Amarynthos are
    being referred to, the question admits more than one interpretation and could
    lead to different answers.
  - The question asks if Vulcano is located south of Amarynthos. Both Vulcano and
    Amarynthos are specific places, which implies a straightforward geographical inquiry.
    However, the question is ambiguous because it does not specify which Vulcano is
    being referred to. Vulcano could refer to the island in Italy, or it could be
    a colloquial or mistaken reference to other places. Similarly, Amarynthos is a
    town in Greece, but without clear context, the question could be interpreted in
    different ways based on assumptions about the locations. This lack of specificity
    leads to multiple potential interpretations and answers.
  - The question asks about the relative location of Vulcano in comparison to Amarynthos.
    However, it is ambiguous because there are multiple places named Vulcano, such
    as the Vulcano Island in Italy, and Amarynthos, which is a town in Greece. Without
    specifying which "Vulcano" the question refers to, it can lead to different answers
    based on the interpretation of the location. Therefore, the question admits more
    than one interpretation.
  - The question "Is Vulcano located south of Amarynthos?" is ambiguous. While it
    asks about the relative location of Vulcano and Amarynthos, it does not specify
    which Vulcano or Amarynthos it refers to. Vulcano could refer to an island in
    Italy, and Amarynthos is a town in Greece, but without additional context, there
    could be other places with the same or similar names. Therefore, the question
    could admit multiple interpretations depending on the specific locations being
    considered.
  - The question asks whether a specific location, Vulcano, is situated south of another
    location, Amarynthos. On the surface, this appears to be a straightforward geographical
    question. However, the question is ambiguous for several reasons. First, there
    are multiple places named Vulcano and Amarynthos around the world, and without
    additional context, it's unclear which specific locations the question refers
    to. Secondly, the interpretation of "south" can vary depending on the specific
    locations being compared and their relative positions on a map. Therefore, the
    question admits more than one interpretation based on the possible identities
    of Vulcano and Amarynthos.
  - The question asks about the relative geographical location of Vulcano in relation
    to Amarynthos. However, the question is ambiguous because there is more than one
    interpretation possible. Firstly, "Vulcano" could refer to Vulcano Island in Italy
    or a generic term for any volcano, while "Amarynthos" is a town in Greece. If
    Vulcano refers to the island in Italy, it is indeed south of Amarynthos. But if
    Vulcano is interpreted as any other location named "Vulcano" or a generic volcano
    elsewhere, the answer could differ. Therefore, the question admits multiple interpretations,
    leading to different answers based on the interpretation of "Vulcano."
  - The question asks about the relative geographical location of Vulcano and Amarynthos.
    However, there is an ambiguity due to the lack of context or specification regarding
    which "Vulcano" or "Amarynthos" is being referred to. "Vulcano" could refer to
    Vulcano Island in Italy, but "Amarynthos" is a town in Greece. Without further
    clarification, the question could be interpreted differently depending on which
    places the person is referring to, leading to different answers.
  - 'The question asks about the relative geographical location of two places: Vulcano
    and Amarynthos. However, the question does not specify which "Vulcano" is being
    referred to, as there are multiple places with similar names. Vulcano could refer
    to an island in Italy or any other location with a similar name. Similarly, Amarynthos
    is a town in Greece, but without clear context, there might be confusion. This
    lack of specificity can lead to different interpretations of what is being asked,
    thus leading to potentially different answers.'
  - The question "Is Vulcano located south of Amarynthos?" is ambiguous because it
    involves two place names, Vulcano and Amarynthos, without additional context or
    specification. "Vulcano" could refer to Vulcano Island in Italy, but without explicit
    clarification, it could also refer to other places or geological features named
    Vulcano. Similarly, "Amarynthos" likely refers to a town in Greece, but without
    further context, it could be mistaken for other places or names. The question
    lacks sufficient detail to conclusively determine which locations are being referred
    to, leading to different possible interpretations and answers.

  - The question asks whether Borgo Maggiore is located south of Borgo San Lorenzo.
    This question involves geographical locations and directions. Without specific
    geographical data or context, this question could be interpreted in different
    ways depending on the definitions of "south" (e.g., general southern direction,
    directly south, etc.) and the consideration of the reference points or borders
    of the locations. Additionally, there might be confusion about the regions in

    different answers based on the specific Borgo San Lorenzo being considered.
  - The question involves the geographical locations of Borgo Maggiore and Borgo San
    Lorenzo. To answer it, one needs to determine their relative positions on a map.
    However, the question is clear in its request for information about the geographical
    relationship between two specific places, and it does not admit multiple interpretations.

    the question is straightforward and admits only one correct interpretation and
    answer.
  - 'The question is asking about the geographical relationship between two specific
    places: Borgo Maggiore and Borgo San Lorenzo. The question is relatively straightforward
    as it seeks to determine whether one place is located south of the other. However,
    the ambiguity arises from the lack of context or specific definitions for what
    "south" might mean (e.g., directly south, generally south, or another geographic
    interpretation). Moreover, without a clear reference map or additional context,
    the answer might vary depending on the precision required or the source of geographic
    data. This makes the question open to different interpretations based on the criteria

    be interpreted in multiple ways, as there are various places with similar names
    globally. Therefore, the question could lead to different answers based on different
    interpretations of the locations involved.
  - The question asks if Sandwip is located south of Sarsuna. However, without specifying
    the context or the region (such as the country or city), the question is ambiguous.
    Sandwip and Sarsuna could refer to different places in different parts of the
    world, which could lead to different interpretations and answers. Without additional
    context to clarify which Sandwip and Sarsuna are being referenced, the question
    remains open to multiple interpretations.

    is ambiguous because "Utran" could refer to multiple places, and without specifying
    which Utran is being referred to, there could be different answers. Additionally,
    the question does not provide sufficient context to determine the exact locations
    being compared. Therefore, the lack of specificity in the name "Utran" and the
    potential for multiple interpretations of what "Utran" refers to makes the question
    ambiguous.
  - The question is asking about the geographical location of Utran in relation to
    Isla Mujeres. However, the question is ambiguous because "Utran" could refer to
    multiple places or entities, and without further context, it's unclear which "Utran"

    the question admits more than one interpretation, leading to different possible
    answers.
  - The question asks about the geographic location of Utran in relation to Isla Mujeres.
    However, the ambiguity arises from the term "Utran," which could refer to multiple
    places or entities, as it is not a widely recognized or unique geographic name.
    Without a specific context or additional information to identify what "Utran"
    refers to, the question admits more than one interpretation, leading to potential
    different answers depending on what "Utran" is considered to be.
  - The question asks if Utran is located south of Isla Mujeres. However, the question
    is ambiguous for a couple of reasons. Firstly, there is a lack of context about
    what "Utran" refers to, as it could be a specific place, a region, or even a fictional
    or lesser-known location. Secondly, without specifying the exact Utran being referred
    to, it's impossible to determine its geographical relationship with Isla Mujeres.
    This lack of specificity leads to multiple interpretations, thus different answers
    could be provided depending on what "Utran" is interpreted to mean.
  - The question asks whether Utran is located south of Isla Mujeres. However, there
    is ambiguity because "Utran" is not a well-known or specific place that can be
    easily identified on a map. Without a clear understanding or definition of what

    what location is being asked about. Therefore, the question does not admit one
    clear interpretation or answer.
  - The question asks if "Utran" is located south of "Isla Mujeres." The interpretation
    of "Utran" is unclear, as there are no widely recognized locations named Utran
    that are well-known internationally. Without a specific and universally acknowledged
    reference to what "Utran" refers to, the question could be interpreted in multiple
    ways based on different assumptions about what "Utran" might be. Therefore, the
    question is ambiguous due to the lack of clarity on what "Utran" represents, leading
    to the potential for multiple interpretations and answers.
  - The question asks about the relative location of Utran in relation to Isla Mujeres.
    However, the question is ambiguous because "Utran" is not a well-known location,
    and without additional context or a specific reference point, it could refer to
    multiple places or might be a typo or misspelling. This lack of clarity on what
    "Utran" specifically refers to makes the question open to multiple interpretations
    and potential answers.
  - The question asks if Utran is located south of Isla Mujeres. However, without
    additional context or clarification, it is unclear what "Utran" refers to, as
    it could be a place, a landmark, or something else entirely. Additionally, if
    "Utran" is a place, its location is not widely known or easily verifiable without
    further specification. This ambiguity in what "Utran" refers to results in multiple
    interpretations, leading to different possible answers.
  - The question asks whether Utran is located south of Isla Mujeres. However, there
    is an issue with the interpretation of the question. "Utran" is not a well-known
    or widely recognized place, and without additional context or clarification, it
    is difficult to determine its location relative to Isla Mujeres. Therefore, the
    question could be interpreted differently depending on what is meant by "Utran,"
    which leads to ambiguity in providing a definitive answer.

  - The question asks about the relative location of Argentine Antarctica in relation
    to the Rothera Research Station. On the surface, it seems to be asking for a geographical
    comparison. However, "Argentine Antarctica" refers to a territorial claim by Argentina
    on a portion of the Antarctic continent, which is not universally recognized due
    to the Antarctic Treaty. Furthermore, without specific coordinates or boundaries,
    the question can be interpreted in different ways depending on how one defines
    "Argentine Antarctica." Therefore, the question admits multiple interpretations
    regarding the definition and recognition of territories in Antarctica.
  - 'The question asks about the relative location of Argentine Antarctica in relation
    to Rothera Research Station. The question is specific in its geographical query,
    asking whether one location is south of another. Argentine Antarctica is a defined
    region claimed by Argentina in Antarctica, and Rothera Research Station is a well-known
    British research station on the Antarctic Peninsula. Given the defined locations,
    the question admits only one interpretation: it is asking about the geographic
    direction between two specific points. Therefore, there is only one correct answer
    to this question.'
  - The question asks about the relative geographical location of Argentine Antarctica
    in relation to Rothera Research Station. The inquiry is clear in its intent to
    determine the position of one specific area (Argentine Antarctica) in relation
    to a known location (Rothera Research Station). Since both Argentine Antarctica
    and Rothera Research Station are defined and recognized places, and their relative
    positions can be determined with available geographical data, the question admits
    only one interpretation and one correct answer.
  - The question asks if Argentine Antarctica is located south of Rothera Research
    Station. The term "Argentine Antarctica" refers to a specific territorial claim
    by Argentina in Antarctica, which is a clearly defined region. Rothera Research
    Station is a well-known British research station in Antarctica. The question is
    straightforward as it asks for a geographical comparison between two specific
    locations, and there is only one correct answer based on their geographical positions.
    Therefore, the question admits only one interpretation and one correct answer.
  - The question asks if Argentine Antarctica is located south of Rothera Research
    Station. This question is AMBIGUOUS because "Argentine Antarctica" refers to a
    sector claimed by Argentina on the continent of Antarctica, which is a large area.
    The question does not specify a particular location within Argentine Antarctica
    to determine whether it is south of Rothera Research Station. Additionally, Rothera
    Research Station is located on the Antarctic Peninsula, and parts of Argentine
    Antarctica could be both north and south of this station depending on the specific
    area being referred to.
  - The question asks whether Argentine Antarctica is located south of Rothera Research
    Station. The interpretation of the question hinges on the geographic locations
    of "Argentine Antarctica" and "Rothera Research Station." Argentine Antarctica
    refers to the portion of Antarctica claimed by Argentina, which is a large area.
    Rothera Research Station is a specific location on the Antarctic Peninsula. Given
    that "Argentine Antarctica" encompasses a broad area, the question could be interpreted
    in different ways, such as whether any part of Argentine Antarctica is south of
    Rothera or whether the main body of Argentine Antarctica is south of Rothera.
    These interpretations could lead to different answers, as parts of Argentine Antarctica
    are indeed south of Rothera, but the main part is not. Therefore, the question
    is ambiguous as it admits more than one interpretation.
  - The question asks whether Argentine Antarctica is located south of Rothera Research
    Station. Rothera Research Station is a British research facility on the Antarctic
    Peninsula. Argentine Antarctica refers to the sector of Antarctica claimed by
    Argentina, which overlaps with the British Antarctic Territory. The ambiguity
    arises because "Argentine Antarctica" is a broad term that could refer to the
    entire claimed area, parts of which are indeed south of Rothera Research Station,
    while other parts are not. Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation
    depending on how one defines "located south of," leading to different answers.
  - The question asks whether Argentine Antarctica is located south of Rothera Research
    Station. This question can be interpreted in different ways due to the use of
    "Argentine Antarctica," which refers to a sector of Antarctica claimed by Argentina
    but not internationally recognized. The term could be interpreted as the entire
    claimed sector or specific Argentine bases within that sector. Depending on this
    interpretation, the answer could vary, as different parts of the claimed area
    could be either north or south of Rothera Research Station. Additionally, "south
    of" could refer to a direct line or a general direction. These ambiguities lead
    to different potential answers.
  - The question asks whether Argentine Antarctica is located south of Rothera Research
    Station. Argentine Antarctica refers to the portion of Antarctica claimed by Argentina,
    while Rothera Research Station is a British research station on the Antarctic
    Peninsula. The question is geographically specific and asks for a directional
    relationship between two defined locations. The interpretation is clear, as it
    is asking for a straightforward geographic comparison. However, because Argentine
    Antarctica covers a large area, the question could be interpreted in different
    ways depending on which part of Argentine Antarctica one is considering. This
    could lead to different answers based on specific locations within Argentine Antarctica
    relative to Rothera Research Station.
  - 'The question asks whether Argentine Antarctica is located south of Rothera Research
    Station. This can be interpreted in a straightforward geographical sense, asking
    for a comparison of the latitudinal positions of two specific locations: Argentine
    Antarctica and Rothera Research Station. However, the term "Argentine Antarctica"
    could be interpreted in different ways, as it is not a single, well-defined location
    but rather a portion of Antarctica claimed by Argentina. The claim overlaps with
    territories claimed by other countries, and the extent of "Argentine Antarctica"
    could vary based on different interpretations of territorial boundaries. This
    introduces ambiguity because the question could be interpreted differently depending
    on how one defines "Argentine Antarctica." Therefore, the question admits more
    than one interpretation, leading to different potential answers.'

  - 'The question asks if Shusha is located south of Dayton, Ohio. This question is
    clear because it asks for a specific geographical relationship between two locations:
    Shusha and Dayton, Ohio. There is only one interpretation of this question, which
    is to determine the relative geographic position of Shusha with respect to Dayton,
    Ohio. The answer can be found by looking at a map or using geographical data to
    ascertain the relative positions of these two places.'
  - The question asks whether a specific location, Shusha, is south of Dayton, Ohio.
    The question is relatively straightforward if "Shusha" refers to a well-defined
    geographic location. However, "Shusha" can refer to different places depending
    on context, such as Shusha in Azerbaijan or potentially other less-known places

    additional context, it's not certain. Second, Rurrenabaque is a town in Bolivia,
    and the relative location can depend on which 'Ili'ili is being considered. Therefore,
    multiple interpretations could lead to different answers depending on which 'Ili'ili
    is meant.
  - The question asks about the relative location of Rurrenabaque in relation to 'Ili'ili.
    However, the term 'Ili'ili could refer to different places, such as a village

  - The question is asking if the Thiruvananthapuram metropolitan area is located
    south of Thiruvananthapuram itself. This question seems to be based on a misunderstanding,
    as a metropolitan area typically includes the city it is named after and its surrounding
    regions. Therefore, the question could be interpreted as asking whether part of
    the metropolitan area is south of the central city, or it could be questioning
    the general geographical relationship between the city and its metropolitan area.
    Since these interpretations could lead to different answers, the question is ambiguous.
  - The question asks if the Thiruvananthapuram metropolitan area is located south
    of Thiruvananthapuram. This is ambiguous because the Thiruvananthapuram metropolitan
    area typically includes the city of Thiruvananthapuram itself and surrounding
    areas. The phrasing suggests a distinction between the city and its metropolitan
    area that does not typically exist, leading to possible confusion. It could be
    interpreted as asking if the metropolitan area extends to the south of the city
    or if there is a separate area south of the city referred to as the metropolitan
    area, both of which could yield different answers.
  - 'The question "Is Thiruvananthapuram metropolitan area located south of Thiruvananthapuram?"
    is ambiguous. The term "Thiruvananthapuram metropolitan area" typically includes
    Thiruvananthapuram itself along with surrounding regions. Therefore, asking if
    it is located south of Thiruvananthapuram can be interpreted in multiple ways:
    it could mean whether the entire metropolitan area is south of the city center,
    or if a specific part of the metropolitan area is south of a specific point within
    Thiruvananthapuram. Additionally, the question might be attempting to distinguish
    between the administrative boundaries of Thiruvananthapuram city and the broader
    metropolitan area, but this is not clearly stated. As such, there are multiple
    interpretations that could lead to different answers.'
  - 'The question is asking about the geographic location of the Thiruvananthapuram
    metropolitan area in relation to Thiruvananthapuram itself. The phrasing of the
    question is inherently contradictory because the metropolitan area typically encompasses
    the city it is named after, and thus cannot logically be located entirely to the
    south of it. The question seems to be based on a misunderstanding or incorrect
    assumption about the relationship between a metropolitan area and the city it
    surrounds. Therefore, the question could be interpreted in different ways: as
    asking whether a part of the metropolitan area extends south of the city, or as
    a misunderstanding of the term "metropolitan area." This makes the question ambiguous.'
  - The question is asking about the location of the Thiruvananthapuram metropolitan
    area in relation to Thiruvananthapuram itself. However, it is inherently ambiguous
    because the metropolitan area generally includes the city of Thiruvananthapuram
    and the surrounding areas. Therefore, it would not be accurate to say that the
    metropolitan area is located entirely south of the city since it encompasses the
    city and extends in multiple directions. The interpretation of "south of Thiruvananthapuram"
    could vary, leading to different answers depending on one's understanding of geographic
    boundaries and definitions of metropolitan areas.
  - The question is asking whether the Thiruvananthapuram metropolitan area is located
    south of Thiruvananthapuram. This is ambiguous because "Thiruvananthapuram metropolitan
    area" generally refers to the urban region surrounding the city of Thiruvananthapuram,
    which includes the city itself. The phrase "located south of Thiruvananthapuram"
    is unclear because it is not specific about which part of the metropolitan area
    is being referred to. Additionally, since Thiruvananthapuram is part of the metropolitan
    area, the question can be interpreted in multiple ways regarding the relationship
    between the city and its metropolitan area. Therefore, the question admits more
    than one interpretation and could lead to different answers.
  - The question asks if the Thiruvananthapuram metropolitan area is located south
    of Thiruvananthapuram. This is ambiguous because the metropolitan area generally
    encompasses the city itself and surrounding regions. The wording suggests a distinction
    between the city and its metropolitan area, which could be interpreted in different
    ways. One could interpret the question as asking if the majority of the metropolitan
    area is geographically south of the central city, which could be true or false
    depending on specific definitions and boundaries. Therefore, the question admits
    more than one interpretation.
  - The question is asking whether the Thiruvananthapuram metropolitan area is located
    south of Thiruvananthapuram. However, this is ambiguous because the metropolitan
    area typically encompasses the main city and its surrounding regions. Therefore,
    the term "metropolitan area" could refer to a larger region that includes Thiruvananthapuram
    itself, making the question unclear. The metropolitan area cannot logically be
    south of itself if it includes Thiruvananthapuram. The question admits more than
    one interpretation, as it could be asking about a specific part of the metropolitan
    area or the relationship between the city and its broader metropolitan region.
  - The question asks whether the Thiruvananthapuram metropolitan area is located
    south of Thiruvananthapuram itself. This is ambiguous because the term "Thiruvananthapuram"
    could refer to either the central city or the broader region, and the metropolitan
    area typically encompasses the central city and surrounding areas. Thus, it is
    unclear if the question is asking whether a part of the metropolitan area is south
    of the central city or if the entire metropolitan area is south of another point
    referred to as Thiruvananthapuram.
  - The question asks whether the Thiruvananthapuram metropolitan area is located
    south of Thiruvananthapuram. This seems to present a geographical paradox because
    a metropolitan area typically includes the city itself and its surrounding areas.
    Therefore, it is unclear whether the question refers to a specific part of the
    metropolitan area being south of the city center or if it is attempting to ask
    something else. This ambiguity in the interpretation of what "located south of
    Thiruvananthapuram" means leads to potential confusion in answering the question.

    the same name), there might be ambiguity in determining the answer. If there is
    only one known Mahis near Qibya, the question could be considered clear, but generally,
    without further specification, it could lead to different interpretations depending
    on the available geographical references.
  - The question asks about the relative geographical location of Qibya in relation
    to Mahis. It is clear in its request for a directional relationship between the
    two places. However, without additional context or specific criteria for what
    "south" might refer to (e.g., based on a particular map projection or local understanding),
    there could be room for interpretation. Despite this, the question seems to imply
    a straightforward geographical inquiry that typically has a clear answer based
    on standard geographic coordinates.
  - The question asks about the geographical location of Qibya relative to Mahis.
    However, without specific additional context or coordinates, the interpretation
    of "south" can vary depending on the map or the specific points chosen within

    of the locations. Thus, the question admits more than one interpretation regarding
    what is considered "south" in this context.
  - 'The question "Is Qibya located south of Mahis?" is asking for a geographical
    relationship between two places: Qibya and Mahis. This is a straightforward question
    about the relative location of two specific places, which can be answered with
    a definite "yes" or "no" based on geographical data. There is no room for interpretation
    in terms of what is being asked, as it seeks a specific directional relationship.
    Therefore, it admits only one interpretation and one correct answer.'
  - The question asks about the geographical location of Qibya in relation to Mahis,
    specifically whether Qibya is located south of Mahis. This is a straightforward
    question that can be answered with a specific geographical fact, assuming the
    locations are known. There is no indication of multiple interpretations or potential
    for different answers, as it pertains to a specific directional query between
    two fixed locations.
  - The question "Is Qibya located south of Mahis?" is asking for a geographical comparison
    between two specific locations, Qibya and Mahis. This question seems to have one
    interpretation, which is to determine the relative geographical position of Qibya
    in relation to Mahis. Assuming the names refer to specific, well-defined places,
    the question can be answered with a straightforward yes or no based on geographical
    data. Therefore, the question is clear in its intent and seeks a factual response.
  - The question asks if Qibya is located south of Mahis, which involves determining
    the geographical relationship between two specific locations. This question could
    be considered CLEAR if Qibya and Mahis are well-defined locations with known geographical
    coordinates. However, if there are multiple places with the same name or if the
    locations are not widely recognized or documented, the question could become AMBIGUOUS.
    Additionally, if there are different interpretations of what "south" means in
    this context (e.g., directly south or generally southward), this could also add
    ambiguity. In general, without additional context or specifications, the question
    may lead to different interpretations depending on the available information about
    the locations.
  - 'The question "Is Qibya located south of Mahis?" asks about the geographical relationship
    between two specific places: Qibya and Mahis. This question can be classified
    as CLEAR because it involves a straightforward geographical inquiry that can be

    answer. However, if there are other places with similar names, or if the context
    of which Qibya and Mahis are being referred to is unclear, the question might
    be interpreted differently. The lack of explicit context about which Qibya and
    Mahis the question refers to makes it potentially ambiguous.
  - 'The question "Is Qibya located south of Mahis?" is asking for a geographical
    relationship between two specific locations: Qibya and Mahis. The question is

    positions of Qibya and Mahis on a map. The answer can be determined by looking
    at a map or geographical data, which would provide a definitive answer. Therefore,
    the question is clear and straightforward.'

  - The question asks whether Gamagara Local Municipality is located south of Meadowbrook,
    Queensland. This question could be interpreted in a straightforward geographical
    context, comparing the two locations. However, the question could be ambiguous
    if there are other places named Meadowbrook in different regions, or if there

    in terms of geographical boundaries and definitions that may not be universally
    agreed upon.
  - The question asks whether Gamagara Local Municipality is located south of Meadowbrook,
    Queensland. The interpretation hinges on geographical locations, which are typically

    is a specific location, the question does not specify if it refers to a specific
    point within Gamagara Local Municipality or the entire municipality, which could
    affect the interpretation. Additionally, the question assumes a straightforward
    north-south relationship without considering the curvature of the Earth or the
    fact that different parts of the municipality could be positioned differently
