  - The question asks about the geographical location of Robert Morris University
    Illinois in relation to La Salle Extension University, both located in Illinois.
    However, Robert Morris University Illinois ceased operations and merged with Roosevelt
    University in 2020, and La Salle Extension University is no longer operational
    as well. This may lead to confusion about the current status or location of these
    institutions. Furthermore, the question could be interpreted as asking for a historical
    or current geographical comparison. These factors introduce ambiguity in understanding
    and answering the question.
  - 'The question is asking for the geographical relationship between two universities
    in Illinois: Robert Morris University Illinois and La Salle Extension University.
    However, there is ambiguity in this question due to the following reasons:

    1. Robert Morris University Illinois was acquired by Roosevelt University in 2020
    and no longer operates independently under that name. This could lead to confusion
    about what is being referred to as "Robert Morris University Illinois."

    2. La Salle Extension University is a historical institution that was operational
    until the 1980s, and its current or last known location may not be widely recognized
    or available.

    Due to these ambiguities in defining the exact locations of both institutions,
    multiple interpretations of the question could exist, leading to different answers.'
  - The question is asking about the geographical location of Robert Morris University
    Illinois in relation to La Salle Extension University in Illinois. The potential
    ambiguity arises from the fact that "Robert Morris University Illinois" could
    refer to a specific campus or the university as a whole, which may have multiple
    campuses. Additionally, "La Salle Extension University" might not have a single,
    well-known location, as it was an educational institution primarily offering correspondence
    courses. Without specific addresses or clear reference points, the question admits
    multiple interpretations regarding which specific locations are being compared.
  - 'The question asks whether Robert Morris University Illinois is located south
    of La Salle Extension University in Illinois. The ambiguity arises because there
    are two institutions with similar names: Robert Morris University Illinois and
    Robert Morris University in Pennsylvania. Additionally, La Salle Extension University
    no longer exists, which might lead to confusion about its historical location.
    Without specific addresses or additional context, the question could be interpreted
    in multiple ways, leading to different answers based on assumptions about which
    institutions are being referenced.'
  - The question is asking whether Robert Morris University Illinois is located south
    of La Salle Extension University in Illinois. However, there are several points
    of ambiguity here. First, Robert Morris University Illinois merged with Roosevelt
    University and is no longer a separate entity, which could lead to confusion about
    its location. Second, La Salle Extension University is a former institution that
    no longer exists, which means it might be unclear what specific location is being
    referred to as its former site. Due to these ambiguities regarding the locations
    of both institutions, the question could admit multiple interpretations, leading
    to different answers depending on the context or assumptions made about the historical
    locations of these institutions.
  - The question asks whether Robert Morris University Illinois is located south of
    La Salle Extension University in Illinois. This requires geographic knowledge
    of the locations of the two universities. However, there is potential ambiguity
    because Robert Morris University Illinois no longer exists under that name as
    it merged with Roosevelt University in 2020. Additionally, La Salle Extension
    University ceased operations in 1982, and its precise location might not be well-documented
    or could have changed over time. These factors introduce uncertainty and multiple
    interpretations regarding the current or historical locations of these institutions.
  - The question asks whether Robert Morris University Illinois is located south of
    La Salle Extension University in Illinois. The interpretation of "south" is straightforward
    in a geographical context, meaning in a direction toward the South Pole or in
    the southern part of an area. However, the question is ambiguous because "Robert
    Morris University Illinois" and "La Salle Extension University" could refer to
    different campuses or locations, especially since La Salle Extension University
    is no longer operational and its historical locations may not be well-documented.
    Additionally, Robert Morris University Illinois merged with Roosevelt University,
    which could lead to confusion about the specific location being referenced. Due
    to these potential ambiguities in identifying the precise locations of the institutions
    being compared, the question admits more than one interpretation.
  - The question asks if Robert Morris University Illinois is located south of La
    Salle Extension University, both in Illinois. The question is ambiguous because
    Robert Morris University Illinois ceased operations in 2020 and was absorbed by
    Roosevelt University, creating uncertainty about its current geographical reference.
    Additionally, La Salle Extension University also no longer exists as it was closed
    in the 1980s. Without a current reference point, determining a clear north-south
    relationship is problematic.
  - The question is asking whether Robert Morris University Illinois is located south
    of La Salle Extension University in Illinois. The question could be considered
    AMBIGUOUS because there is more than one Robert Morris University, and the university
    in Illinois has undergone changes, including closures and mergers. Additionally,
    La Salle Extension University is no longer operational, which could lead to confusion
    about its exact location. These factors could lead to multiple interpretations
    and answers about the current and past locations of these institutions.
  - This question is AMBIGUOUS because it assumes the existence of a current institution
    called La Salle Extension University, which historically existed but is no longer
    in operation. Furthermore, without clear geographic coordinates or current operational
    status for both institutions, the question can lead to different interpretations
    about what "south" might mean in this context.

  - The question asks whether Franklin College of Arts and Sciences is located south
    of the University of Georgia School of Public and International Affairs, both
    of which are in Georgia. However, the question is ambiguous because both entities
    are part of the University of Georgia, and it's unclear whether the question refers
    to their administrative locations or their physical buildings. Additionally, within
    a single campus, the relative positioning of departments can be complex and may
    not be easily determined without specific geographical data. Therefore, the question
    admits more than one interpretation, which could lead to different answers based
    on how one interprets "located south of."
  - 'The question asks about the relative geographical location of two entities: Franklin

    of a specific place named Sonnencroft in West Virginia. However, there is ambiguity
    because there is no well-known or documented place by that name in West Virginia,
    which could lead to different interpretations or require additional context or
    clarification. The ambiguity arises from the potential non-existence or lack of
    recognition of Sonnencroft, WV, making it difficult to provide a definitive answer.
  - The question asks whether Indiana State University in Indiana is located south
    of Sonnencroft in West Virginia. The question is potentially ambiguous because
    "Sonnencroft, WV" is not a widely recognized location, which could lead to confusion.
    If Sonnencroft is a fictional or lesser-known place, its location might not be
    easily determined, making it difficult to provide a definitive answer. Additionally,
    without a clear and specific location for Sonnencroft, the interpretation of "south
    of" could vary depending on where Sonnencroft is presumed to be.
  - The question asks whether Indiana State University in Indiana is located south
    of Sonnencroft, West Virginia. The interpretation of the question is straightforward,
    as it is asking for a geographical comparison based on latitude between two specific

    of RIT, so it is not possible for it to be located in a different position relative
    to RIT itself. The question assumes that the college is a separate entity with
    a distinct location, which is incorrect. This misinterpretation makes the question
    ambiguous because it leads to confusion about whether the question refers to a
    different college named similarly or if it is misunderstanding the organizational
    structure of RIT.
  - The question asks for the geographical location of the Kate Gleason College of
    Engineering in relation to the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). However,
    the Kate Gleason College of Engineering is part of RIT, which makes the question

    between these institutions.
  - The question asks for the geographical location of the Kate Gleason College of
    Engineering in relation to the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), both of
    which are in New York. The Kate Gleason College of Engineering is actually part
    of RIT, located on the same campus in Rochester, NY. Therefore, the question can
    be interpreted as asking whether the specific buildings or facilities of the Kate
    Gleason College are situated south of other parts of the RIT campus. This could
    be clear if the exact campus layout is known, but without specific details or
    a map, it may be difficult to provide a definitive answer. However, since the

  - The question asks about the geographical location of the Kate Gleason College
    of Engineering in relation to the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). The
    Kate Gleason College of Engineering is actually a part of the Rochester Institute
    of Technology. Therefore, the question can be interpreted as asking whether a
    part of an institution is located in a particular direction relative to the institution
    itself. This interpretation could lead to confusion because the college and the

    they are separate entities that can be located relative to one another. This can
    lead to confusion since the question seems to misrepresent the relationship between
    the two. However, the interpretation of the question is clear in terms of asking
    about geographical orientation; it just relies on incorrect premises.
  - The question asks for the relative location of the Kate Gleason College of Engineering
    in relation to the Rochester Institute of Technology. However, there is a misunderstanding
    in the phrasing. The Kate Gleason College of Engineering is part of the Rochester

    located "south" of the Rochester Institute of Technology is nonsensical because
    it is not a separate entity with a distinct location. The question can be interpreted
    in only one way based on the geographical and institutional context, but it is
    based on incorrect assumptions about the separate existence of the college and
    the institute.

  - The question asks whether George Mason University in Virginia is located south
    of the University of Northern Virginia in Virginia. However, there is an ambiguity
    because the "University of Northern Virginia" does not have a widely recognized
    physical campus location as it primarily operated as an online university before
    it was closed. This could lead to different interpretations about what is meant
    by "located south of" since the University of Northern Virginia doesn't have a
    specific location to compare against. Additionally, the reference to "University
    of Northern Virginia" may lead to confusion with other institutions with similar
    names or assumptions about its location.
  - The question asks about the geographical location of George Mason University in
    relation to the University of Northern Virginia. The ambiguity arises because
    there is no widely recognized institution called the "University of Northern Virginia."
    Historically, there was a for-profit institution by that name, but it was closed.
    Without a clearly defined location for the "University of Northern Virginia,"
    the question admits more than one interpretation, as it could refer to different
    places or be based on outdated information.
  - The question asks whether George Mason University in Virginia is located south
    of the University of Northern Virginia, also in Virginia. The ambiguity arises
    because the "University of Northern Virginia" is not a clearly defined or widely
    recognized institution, as there have been various locations and even controversies
    surrounding entities using this name. Without a definitive location for the University
    of Northern Virginia, the question admits more than one interpretation regarding
    the specific location to compare against George Mason University. This leads to
    potential multiple answers depending on which location is considered.
  - The question is asking about the relative geographical location of George Mason
    University and the University of Northern Virginia, both in Virginia. The question
    is straightforward if both universities are well-defined entities with known locations.
    However, the University of Northern Virginia is no longer operational, and its
    location might not be commonly known or could be interpreted differently. Additionally,
    the name "University of Northern Virginia" could be interpreted as a general reference
    to a region rather than a specific institution, which adds ambiguity. These factors
    make the question open to more than one interpretation and answer.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographic location of George Mason
    University (GMU) in Virginia compared to the University of Northern Virginia (UNVA)
    in Virginia. The question could be considered ambiguous for a couple of reasons:
    1) The University of Northern Virginia (UNVA) is a defunct university that had
    multiple locations, and it is unclear which specific location is being referred
    to, if any. 2) The term "south of" can be interpreted in terms of specific campus
    buildings or the general area, adding another layer of ambiguity if multiple campuses
    are considered. Without specific context or current operational locations, the
    question can lead to different interpretations.'
  - The question asks about the relative geographical location of George Mason University
    in relation to the University of Northern Virginia, both presumably located in
    Virginia. The term "south of" is a clear geographical descriptor, which should
    be answerable with a map or coordinates. However, there is ambiguity because "University
    of Northern Virginia" could refer to different entities or campuses. Historically,
    the University of Northern Virginia had a campus in Annandale, Virginia, but it
    was closed, and the institution is no longer operational. Therefore, the question
    could be interpreted differently depending on which location or reference point
    for the University of Northern Virginia is used. Additionally, if the reference
    is to a non-existent or informal name or to another entity that had multiple locations,
    it would further add to the ambiguity.
  - The question asks whether George Mason University in Virginia is located south
    of the University of Northern Virginia, also in Virginia. At first glance, this
    appears to be a straightforward geographical question. However, there is ambiguity
    due to the mention of the "University of Northern Virginia." This institution
    was a for-profit university that had its accreditation revoked and was ordered
    to close in 2013. It had multiple campus locations, including one in Annandale,
    VA, but it no longer operates. Therefore, the question can be interpreted in multiple
    ways based on the specific location being referred to, and the fact that the university
    is no longer operational adds another layer of complexity. This makes it difficult
    to provide a single correct answer without additional context about which campus
    or location is being referenced, if any.
  - The question is asking whether George Mason University in Virginia is located
    south of the University of Northern Virginia in Virginia. However, the University
    of Northern Virginia, as an institution, has undergone changes and relocations,
    and its main campus was not permanently established in a single location, leading
    to potential confusion about its current or past geographic location. This introduces
    ambiguity because the location of the University of Northern Virginia may vary
    depending on the time frame or context considered. Additionally, the University
    of Northern Virginia ceased operations in the U.S., which adds further complexity
    to determining its exact location relative to George Mason University. Thus, the
    question admits more than one interpretation regarding the location of the University
    of Northern Virginia.
  - The question asks whether George Mason University in Virginia is located south
    of the University of Northern Virginia, also in Virginia. The ambiguity arises
    from the fact that the "University of Northern Virginia" does not have a widely
    recognized campus location, as it has faced accreditation issues and closures,
    making it unclear which specific location is being referenced. Without a specific
    and recognized location for the University of Northern Virginia, the question
    admits multiple interpretations regarding its geographic placement relative to
    George Mason University.
  - The question asks whether George Mason University in Virginia is located south
    of the University of Northern Virginia in Virginia. To determine if the question
    is clear or ambiguous, we need to consider the locations of the two universities.
    George Mason University is a well-known university located in Fairfax, Virginia.
    However, the "University of Northern Virginia" could refer to different entities
    or be a misnomer, as there isn't a widely recognized institution by that exact
    name. This introduces ambiguity because without a clear definition or location
    for the "University of Northern Virginia," the question could lead to different
    interpretations and answers depending on what is assumed to be the location of
    the "University of Northern Virginia." Therefore, the question is ambiguous due
    to the lack of clarity regarding the exact location or existence of the "University
    of Northern Virginia."

    is based on a misunderstanding of the structure of the university, leading to
    confusion and ambiguity. Additionally, since both references are to the same institution,
    the question about their relative location does not make sense, as they are essentially
    the same place. Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation, primarily
    due to the misunderstanding of the entities involved.'
  - The question is ambiguous because it does not specify the location of "Angelo

    from the misunderstanding or misrepresentation of the structure of Angelo State
    University.
  - 'The question involves determining the geographical relationship between two entities:

    TX" or if it is simply a college within the university, thus not having a separate
    geographical location. This could lead to different interpretations and answers
    based on how one defines the locations involved.'
  - The question asks whether Angelo State University in Texas is located south of
    Angelo State University College of Sciences, also in Texas. This question is ambiguous
    because it assumes that "Angelo State University College of Sciences" is a separate

    to different answers.
  - The question asks if Angelo State University, TX is located south of Angelo State
    University College of Sciences, TX. This can be interpreted in different ways.
    Firstly, "Angelo State University College of Sciences" might refer to a specific
    building or department within Angelo State University itself, in which case, the
    question is asking about the relative location within the same university campus.
    Alternatively, if "Angelo State University College of Sciences" is mistakenly
    thought to be a separate institution, the question might be asking about the relative
    location of two different campuses, which could lead to confusion. The ambiguity
    lies in whether "Angelo State University College of Sciences" is considered as
    part of the same entity or a separate entity, leading to different interpretations
    of what is being compared in terms of location.
