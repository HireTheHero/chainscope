  - 'The question "Can a grizzly bear run slower than a giraffe?" is asking about
    the relative speeds of two animals: a grizzly bear and a giraffe. The interpretation
    of the question is straightforward, as it is asking if there exists a scenario
    where a grizzly bear''s running speed is less than that of a giraffe. This question
    has one interpretation based on comparing the running speeds of the two animals,
    which can be answered based on known data about their typical running speeds.
    Therefore, the question admits one interpretation and one correct answer.'
  - 'The question "Can a grizzly bear run slower than a giraffe?" is asking whether
    it is possible for a grizzly bear to run at a speed less than that of a giraffe.
    This question admits one interpretation: comparing the running speeds of a grizzly
    bear and a giraffe to determine if a grizzly bear can indeed run slower. The question
    implies a comparison of maximum running speeds or scenarios where a grizzly bear
    might choose or be forced to run slower than a giraffe. Therefore, the question
    is straightforward and can be answered by comparing the known speeds of these
    animals.'
  - 'The question "Can a grizzly bear run slower than a giraffe?" asks whether it
    is possible for a grizzly bear to run at a speed lower than that of a giraffe.
    This can be interpreted in two ways: it could be asking about the maximum running
    speeds of each animal to determine which is generally slower, or it could be asking
    whether, in some circumstances, a grizzly bear might run slower than a giraffe
    (e.g., if the bear is injured or not running at full speed). These different interpretations
    could lead to different answers, making the question ambiguous.'
  - 'The question "Can a grizzly bear run slower than a giraffe?" is asking for a
    comparison of the running speeds of a grizzly bear and a giraffe. This can be
    interpreted in two ways: 1) Is it possible for a grizzly bear to run at a speed
    slower than the maximum speed of a giraffe? 2) Is it common or typical for a grizzly
    bear to run slower than a giraffe? The first interpretation focuses on the capability,
    while the second focuses on typical behavior. These interpretations could lead
    to different answers depending on whether we are discussing capability or typical
    behavior.'
  - 'The question "Can a grizzly bear run slower than a giraffe?" is asking about
    the relative speeds of a grizzly bear and a giraffe. It implies a comparison between
    the running speeds of the two animals. The interpretation hinges on known data
    about the maximum running speeds of each animal. Typically, a grizzly bear can
    run up to 35 mph, while a giraffe can run at speeds up to 37 mph. Given this information,
    the question can be interpreted in a straightforward manner: yes, a grizzly bear
    can indeed run slower than a giraffe. There is only one interpretation and one
    correct answer based on factual data.'

  - 'The question "Can a grizzly bear run slower than a giraffe?" is asking whether
    it is possible for a grizzly bear to have a slower running speed compared to a
    giraffe. This question is straightforward as it seeks to compare the running speeds
    of two specific animals. The interpretation hinges on the known average speeds
    of these animals: grizzly bears can run up to 35 mph, while giraffes can run up
    to 37 mph. Therefore, it is clear that a grizzly bear can indeed run slower than
    a giraffe, especially if it is not running at its maximum speed. This question
    does not admit multiple interpretations and leads to a single conclusion based
    on factual data about animal speeds.'
  - The question asks whether a grizzly bear can run slower than a giraffe. This question
    can be interpreted in a few ways. It could be asking about the general speed comparison
    between grizzly bears and giraffes, or it could be inquiring about specific instances
    where a grizzly bear might choose to run slower than a giraffe, such as if the
    bear is tired or injured. The general speed of a grizzly bear is typically slower
    than that of a giraffe, but the question doesn't specify context, leading to potential
    ambiguity. Therefore, it admits more than one interpretation.

    giraffe. This can be interpreted in only one way, and the answer can be determined
    by looking at the average running speeds of both animals. Grizzly bears can run
    up to around 35 mph, while giraffes can run at speeds up to around 37 mph. Therefore,
    it is possible for a grizzly bear to run slower than a giraffe. The question does
    not admit multiple interpretations and has a straightforward answer based on factual
    data.'
  - The question "Can a grizzly bear run slower than a giraffe?" is asking whether
    it is possible for a grizzly bear to run at a speed that is less than the running
    speed of a giraffe. This question can be interpreted in more than one way. One

    if a grizzly bear is generally slower. Another interpretation could be a situational
    comparison where a particular grizzly bear is running slower than a particular
    giraffe at a specific moment. These interpretations could lead to different answers
    depending on the context or the specific individuals being compared.

    of the two animals. The question implies a direct comparison between their maximum
    or typical running speeds. Generally, a hippopotamus can run at speeds up to 30
    km/h, while a gorilla can run at speeds up to 40 km/h. Therefore, the question
    is clear in its intention to compare the speeds, and there is one correct answer
    based on available data about these animals' speeds.
  - The question is asking about the relative running speeds of a hippopotamus and
    a gorilla. This can be interpreted in a straightforward manner, comparing the
    typical running speeds of these two animals. However, the question does not specify
    conditions under which the comparison should be made (e.g., on land, in water,
    under stress, etc.), nor does it define what "run" means for each animal, as their
    locomotion might differ. Despite these potential ambiguities, the primary interpretation
    is a direct comparison of average running speeds, which is a common and measurable
    attribute. Thus, the question can be reasonably interpreted to have one main interpretation
    leading to a factual answer based on biological data.
  - The question "Can a hippopotamus run slower than a gorilla?" is asking for a comparison

    \ speeds of tigers and lions. On the surface, it seems straightforward as it queries\
    \ whether there is a scenario where a tiger could run at a slower pace than a\
    \ lion. However, the question could be interpreted in a couple of ways: \n\n1.\
    \ It might be asking about the general maximum speeds of tigers and lions, in\
    \ which case one would refer to the average maximum speed data for these animals.\
    \ Typically, lions can run at a maximum speed slightly faster than tigers, suggesting\
