  - The question asks about the geographical location of Apple University, CA relative
    to California South Bay University, CA. However, the question is ambiguous because
    "Apple University" is not a well-known or established institution, and there is
    no public record of its existence as a physical location. This makes it unclear
    whether the question refers to an actual place or if it is hypothetical. Additionally,
    without clear definitions or widely recognized locations, it is impossible to
    determine their relative positions, leading to multiple interpretations and potential
    answers.
  - The question is asking about the geographical location of "Apple University, CA"
    in relation to "California South Bay University, CA." The ambiguity arises from
    the fact that there is no well-known or widely recognized institution named "Apple
    University" in California or elsewhere, as "Apple University" typically refers
    to an internal training program within Apple Inc. Additionally, "California South
    Bay University" is not a widely recognized or established institution. Without
    clear, verifiable locations for these entities, the question admits more than
    one interpretation regarding what these entities are and where they might be located.
    Thus, different answers could be given depending on assumptions made about the
    existence and location of these universities.
  - 'The question is asking about the geographical location of two institutions: Apple
    University, CA, and California South Bay University, CA. However, it is ambiguous
    because there is no widely known institution named "Apple University" in California,
    and the term could refer to either a fictional entity or a lesser-known institution.
    Additionally, "California South Bay University" could also be fictional or not
    well-known, leading to multiple interpretations of what these entities are and
    where they are located. Without clear definitions or well-known references for
    these institutions, the question admits more than one interpretation and cannot
    be answered definitively.'
  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographical location of two entities:
    Apple University, CA, and California South Bay University, CA. However, the question
    is ambiguous for several reasons. Firstly, "Apple University" is not a well-known
    or widely recognized institution, which makes it unclear whether it refers to
    an actual educational institution or a hypothetical one. Secondly, the phrasing
    "west of California South Bay University, CA" requires precise geographical knowledge
    about both locations to answer accurately. Without clear information on the existence
    and location of "Apple University," multiple interpretations could arise, leading
    to different answers. Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation.'
  - The question is asking about the relative location of two institutions, Apple
    University, CA, and California South Bay University, CA. However, there is ambiguity
    here because "Apple University" is not a widely recognized educational institution,
    and without more context or information, it's unclear whether such a university
    exists or what its specific location might be. Additionally, if Apple University
    is a fictional or lesser-known institution, its location would not be well-established,
    making it difficult to ascertain its position relative to California South Bay
    University. Furthermore, the phrase "west of California South Bay University,
    CA" could also be interpreted differently depending on the specific locations
    within California that are being referenced. Due to these ambiguities regarding
    the existence and location of Apple University, the question admits more than
    one interpretation.
  - 'The question is asking for a geographical comparison between two locations: Apple
    University, CA and California South Bay University, CA. However, the ambiguity
    arises because "Apple University" is not a widely recognized or established institution
    and might not exist as a physical location. Additionally, without specific addresses
    or more detailed information about the exact locations of these institutions,
    the question admits multiple interpretations regarding what is being compared
    and where these universities are. Therefore, due to the lack of clear reference
    points and the potential non-existence of "Apple University," the question can

  - The question asks if Northcentral University in Arizona is located west of Wilkes
    University in Mesa, Arizona. However, there is an ambiguity in the question. Northcentral
    University is primarily based in San Diego, California, which is indeed west of
    Mesa, Arizona. However, if the question refers to a specific branch or location
    of Northcentral University within Arizona, the interpretation could change. Moreover,
    Wilkes University is originally based in Pennsylvania, but the question refers
    to a location in Mesa, Arizona. Therefore, the question could be interpreted in
    multiple ways depending on the specific locations being referred to, which could
    lead to different answers.
  - 'The question asks about the relative geographical location of two universities:
    Northcentral University in Arizona (AZ) and Wilkes University in Mesa, Arizona
    (AZ). The ambiguity arises because "Northcentral University, AZ" is not the same
    as "Northcentral University" which is primarily based in San Diego, California.
    Furthermore, Wilkes University is primarily based in Pennsylvania but has a campus
    in Mesa, AZ. The question does not specify whether it is referring to these main
    campuses or satellite locations. Additionally, there could be confusion about
    the precise locations of these campuses in Arizona, leading to multiple interpretations.
    Therefore, the question is ambiguous due to potential misunderstandings about
    campus locations and names.'
  - 'The question asks whether Northcentral University in Arizona is located west
    of Wilkes University in Mesa, Arizona. The question is clear in its request for
    a geographical comparison between two specific locations. However, there is a
    fundamental issue: Wilkes University is actually based in Pennsylvania, not Arizona,
    though it does have a campus in Mesa, Arizona. Assuming the question refers to
    this Mesa campus, it becomes a simple geographical question. The question doesn''t
    provide enough context to indicate any ambiguity in terms of interpretation; it''s
    a straightforward comparison of geographical locations.'
  - The question is asking about the geographic locations of Northcentral University
    in Arizona and Wilkes University in Mesa, Arizona, and whether one is located
    west of the other. However, there is ambiguity in the phrasing. Northcentral University
    is not located in Arizona; it is based in San Diego, California, which adds confusion.
    Additionally, Wilkes University is primarily located in Pennsylvania, but the
    question refers to a location in Mesa, Arizona. Without further clarification
    on these locations, the question could be interpreted in different ways depending
    on the understanding of the university locations.
  - The question asks whether Northcentral University in Arizona is located west of
    Wilkes University in Mesa, Arizona. The question is straightforward in terms of
    geographic location, as it requires determining the relative western position
    of two specific university locations within the state of Arizona. However, there
    is an ambiguity regarding the location of Northcentral University, as it is primarily
    an online university with headquarters in San Diego, California, and may not have
    a specific physical campus in Arizona. Additionally, Wilkes University is primarily
    based in Pennsylvania, though it does have a campus in Mesa, AZ. This ambiguity
    in the physical presence of the universities in Arizona makes the question open
    to interpretation regarding which specific locations are being compared.
  - The question asks whether Northcentral University, AZ is located west of Wilkes
    University, Mesa, AZ. The ambiguity arises because Northcentral University does
    not have a campus in Arizona; it is primarily an online university based in San
    Diego, California, while Wilkes University, Mesa, AZ, does have a location in
    Arizona. Therefore, the question could be interpreted in different ways depending
    on whether the inquirer is aware of Northcentral University's actual location
    or is assuming it has a physical campus in Arizona.
  - The question asks about the geographical locations of Northcentral University,
    AZ, and Wilkes University, Mesa, AZ, specifically whether Northcentral University
    is located west of Wilkes University. However, there is ambiguity because it is
    not clear if "Wilkes University, Mesa, AZ" refers to a satellite campus of Wilkes
    University in Mesa, AZ, or if it's a misunderstanding, as Wilkes University is
    primarily located in Pennsylvania. Additionally, Northcentral University, while
    headquartered in Arizona, primarily offers online programs, which adds to the
    ambiguity of its physical location in relation to another university. Therefore,
    the question can be interpreted in multiple ways, leading to different answers
    based on the interpretation of the locations involved.
  - The question asks if Northcentral University, AZ is located west of Wilkes University,
    Mesa, AZ. However, there is ambiguity in the phrasing because Northcentral University
    is typically associated with a location in Prescott Valley, AZ, not a specific
    location simply labeled as "AZ". Additionally, Wilkes University is known to have
    a location in Mesa, AZ, but the question does not specify if it refers to another
    location. The ambiguity arises from the lack of precise geographic locations for
    both universities, leading to potential multiple interpretations of their locations
    within Arizona.
  - The question asks about the geographical location of Northcentral University in
    Arizona relative to Wilkes University in Mesa, Arizona. However, there seems to
    be some confusion in the question because Wilkes University is not located in
    Mesa, Arizona. Instead, Northcentral University is headquartered in Scottsdale,
    Arizona, and Wilkes University is located in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. If the
    question intended to ask about locations within Arizona, then it is misleading
    because Wilkes University does not have a campus in Mesa, AZ. This leads to ambiguity
    in the interpretation of the question, as the geographic locations mentioned do
    not correspond accurately to existing universities.
  - The question asks whether Northcentral University, AZ is located west of Wilkes
    University, Mesa, AZ. This question is based on geographical locations. However,
    there is ambiguity because Wilkes University is primarily located in Pennsylvania,
    and it is not clear if there is a specific branch or extension in Mesa, AZ. Without
    specific information on the exact locations of these institutions or their branches,
    the question could be interpreted differently. Additionally, if both universities
    have multiple campuses, determining which campuses to compare could lead to different
    answers.

  - The question asks if the Ipswich Female Seminary in Massachusetts is located west
    of the University of New England in Maine. The question is geographically specific,
    involving the relative locations of two educational institutions. The Ipswich
    Female Seminary is a historical institution and no longer exists, which could
    introduce some ambiguity. However, if we interpret the question in the context
    of historical geography, Ipswich, MA, is located south of the University of New
    England in Biddeford, ME, rather than west. The interpretation hinges on current
    geographical knowledge, which suggests a clear answer based on historical context.
  - The question is asking for a geographical comparison between Ipswich Female Seminary
    in Massachusetts and the University of New England in Maine. However, Ipswich
    Female Seminary was a historical institution that no longer exists, which could
    lead to confusion about how to interpret its location. Additionally, the phrasing
    "located west of" is straightforward, but the historical nature of the seminary
    adds ambiguity to the question because it is unclear if the question refers to
    its historical location or if it assumes the seminary is still operational. This
    ambiguity makes it difficult to provide a definitive answer.
  - The question asks about the geographical location of Ipswich Female Seminary in
    relation to the University of New England. However, the Ipswich Female Seminary
    no longer exists, as it was operational in the 19th century and has since closed.
    This historical aspect makes the question ambiguous because it could be interpreted
    as asking about the historical location of the seminary or the location of where
    it used to be. Additionally, without specifying a point of reference or clarifying
    if it means historical or present geographical terms, the question can lead to
    different interpretations and answers.
  - 'The question asks about the geographical location of Ipswich Female Seminary
    in relation to the University of New England. However, Ipswich Female Seminary

    could be interpreted in two ways: one might consider the historical location of
    the seminary, while another might wonder if there is a modern equivalent or site
    that people recognize as Ipswich Female Seminary. Additionally, the question assumes
    a straightforward east-west comparison, which might not be precise given geographical
    coordinates. These factors introduce ambiguity in understanding and answering
    the question.'
  - The question asks whether the Ipswich Female Seminary in Massachusetts is located
    west of the University of New England in Maine. The question is straightforward
    in seeking a geographical comparison based on the relative longitudinal positions
    of two specific locations. However, Ipswich Female Seminary is a historical institution
    that no longer exists, which may cause confusion about its current location. Despite
    this, the question itself is clear in its intent to compare the geographical positions
    of two locations, assuming historical context is understood.
  - The question asks whether Ipswich Female Seminary in Massachusetts is located
    west of the University of New England in Maine. At first glance, the question
    seems straightforward, asking for a geographical comparison. However, Ipswich
    Female Seminary is a historical institution that no longer exists, which introduces
    ambiguity. The current geographical location of where Ipswich Female Seminary
    used to be can still be compared to the University of New England, but the reference
    to a non-existing institution adds complexity. Additionally, the exact definition
    of "west" can be interpreted differently (e.g., direct west, generally westward),
    potentially leading to varied answers based on interpretation. Therefore, the
    question admits more than one interpretation, leading to different answers depending
    on how one approaches the historical and geographical context.
  - The question is asking about the geographical location of Ipswich Female Seminary
    in relation to the University of New England. However, there are ambiguities present.
    Firstly, Ipswich Female Seminary is a historical institution that no longer exists,
    which could lead to confusion about its precise location. Secondly, the question
    does not specify which campus of the University of New England (UNE) is being
    referred to, as UNE has multiple campuses in Maine. This lack of specificity means
    the question could be interpreted in different ways depending on which UNE campus
    is considered, leading to different answers about the relative locations.
  - The question is asking about the geographical location of Ipswich Female Seminary
    in relation to the University of New England. However, Ipswich Female Seminary
    is a historical institution that no longer exists, which could lead to confusion
    or multiple interpretations regarding its "location." Furthermore, without specifying
    which campus of the University of New England is being referenced (since it has
    multiple campuses), the question could lead to different answers depending on
    interpretation. Thus, the question is ambiguous because it lacks clarity in terms
    of historical context and specific campus reference.
  - The question asks whether Ipswich Female Seminary, MA is located west of the University
    of New England, ME. The question is ambiguous for several reasons. Firstly, Ipswich
    Female Seminary is a historical institution that no longer exists as a current
    educational entity, which could lead to confusion about its location. Secondly,
    the phrase "located west of" requires clarification on whether it refers to the
    geographical location of the historical site or if it is asking about something
    else. Additionally, the question does not specify which campus of the University
    of New England, ME is being referred to, as UNE has multiple campuses. These factors
    lead to multiple interpretations of the question.

  - The question asks about the geographical location of Meadows School of the Arts
    in relation to Southern Methodist University in Texas. Meadows School of the Arts
    is a part of Southern Methodist University, located on the university's campus.
    Therefore, the question can only be interpreted as asking whether a part of a
    university is located west of the university itself, which is a nonsensical question

    Meadows School of the Arts is a part of Southern Methodist University, specifically
    its arts school. Therefore, the question is based on a misunderstanding of the
    relationship between the two entities, as they are not separate locations. This
    inherent misunderstanding makes the question ambiguous, as it could be interpreted
    in various ways, such as asking about a specific building or department within
    the university, or it may simply reflect confusion about the entities involved.
  - The question is asking about the geographical location of Meadows School of the
    Arts in relation to Southern Methodist University (SMU), both of which are in
    Texas. Meadows School of the Arts is a part of SMU, located on the SMU campus

    is located west of the university itself, which is inherently ambiguous because
    it is part of the same institution. The wording could be interpreted in various
    ways, such as asking about different campuses or buildings within the same campus.
    Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation and could lead to
    different answers based on how one interprets the relationship between the school
    and the university.

  - 'The question involves determining the relative location of two entities: the
    University of Georgia and the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences. The ambiguity
    arises because the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences is not a separate location;
    it is part of the University of Georgia, located in Athens, GA. Therefore, the
    question essentially asks about the relative location of an institution with respect

    College of Arts and Sciences. However, the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences
    is actually a part of the University of Georgia itself, as it is the university''s
    oldest college. This makes the question inherently confusing because it implies
    that they are separate entities that could be located in different places. Due
    to this misunderstanding, the question could lead to different interpretations:
    one could interpret it as asking about the physical location of the main campus
    versus a specific building or part of the campus, or it could be seen as a misunderstanding
    of the relationship between the two. This ambiguity in understanding the relationship
    between the two entities results in the question being ambiguous.'
  - The question asks about the geographical location of the University of Georgia
    in relation to the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences. However, it is ambiguous
    because the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences is not a separate institution
    with its own distinct location; it is a college within the University of Georgia.
    This means the question could be interpreted as asking about the relative location
    of two parts of the same university, which does not have a clear or meaningful
    answer. Additionally, without specifying which campus or specific buildings within
    the University of Georgia are being compared, the question lacks clarity.
  - The question asks whether the University of Georgia is located west of the Franklin
    College of Arts and Sciences, both of which are in Georgia. This question is ambiguous
    because the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences is actually a part of the University

    spatial relationship between the two, as they are not distinct locations. Furthermore,
    without additional context, it is difficult to determine if the question refers
    to specific buildings or campuses. This could lead to different answers depending
    on the interpretation of what is meant by "west" in this context.
  - The question asks whether the University of Georgia is located west of Franklin
    College of Arts and Sciences. The ambiguity arises from the fact that the Franklin
    College of Arts and Sciences is a part of the University of Georgia. Therefore,
    the question could be interpreted as asking whether one part of the University
    of Georgia is located west of another part of the same university, which doesn't
    make logical sense. Alternatively, it could be interpreted as comparing two separate
    institutions, but since Franklin College of Arts and Sciences is not a separate
    institution from the University of Georgia, this leads to confusion. The question

    to confusion as to whether the question is asking about the location of two separate
    institutions or within the same university. Therefore, the question admits more
    than one interpretation regarding the entities being compared.
  - 'The question asks about the relative geographic locations of the University of
    Georgia and Franklin College of Arts and Sciences in Georgia. However, the Franklin
    College of Arts and Sciences is a part of the University of Georgia, not a separate
    institution. This makes the question ambiguous because it can be interpreted in
    two ways: 1) asking if the University of Georgia''s main campus is located west
    of its own Franklin College of Arts and Sciences, or 2) misunderstanding Franklin
    College of Arts and Sciences as a separate entity, thus questioning their relative
    locations. The question''s ambiguity arises from the misunderstanding of the relationship
    between the two entities.'
  - The question is asking for the relative location of the University of Georgia
    in relation to the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences. However, the Franklin
    College of Arts and Sciences is a part of the University of Georgia, which implies
    they are in the same location. This makes the question somewhat ambiguous because
    it is unclear whether the question is asking about different campuses or locations
    within the same university. Additionally, without further context, it might be
    interpreted as asking about the physical geography within the university, which
    could lead to different interpretations depending on how the locations are defined
    or understood.
  - The question asks whether the University of Georgia is located west of the Franklin
    College of Arts and Sciences. However, the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences
    is actually a part of the University of Georgia, which makes the question inherently
    unclear. It could be interpreted as asking about the relative position of two
    parts of the same institution, which does not make logical sense in a geographical
    context. Additionally, without specifying a reference point or understanding the
    internal layout, the question lacks clarity on what is meant by "west" in this
    context.

    and is no longer operational. It is unclear whether the question refers to the
    location where Tri-Valley University was once situated or if it is asking about
    a different institution entirely. Additionally, if it is referring to the past
    location, different interpretations of the boundaries of the Tri-Valley area could
    lead to different answers. Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation.

    of "Widener University, DE." Without clear information on what "Widener University,
    DE" refers to, the question could be interpreted in different ways, leading to
    different conclusions about its location relative to Delaware State University.

    itself. As such, the question seems to suggest a distinction between two separate
    locations when they are actually part of the same campus. Additionally, without
    specific coordinates or a detailed map reference, determining the precise western
    direction within a campus can be unclear. Therefore, the question could lead to
    different interpretations regarding what is being compared or measured.'
  - The question asks about the relative location of Eastern Michigan University (EMU)

    which is part of EMU. The question could be interpreted in multiple ways because
    it assumes that the College of Health and Human Services might be a separate entity
    or location from the main campus of EMU. However, since the college is a part
    of EMU and located on the same campus, the question could be seen as straightforward
    if both are considered to be in the same place. Yet, without specific information
    about their exact locations on the campus, the interpretation of the question
    can vary, leading to different answers depending on how one perceives the layout
    of the campus. This makes the question ambiguous.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographical location of two entities:

    whole, while "Eastern Michigan University College of Health and Human Services,
    MI" is a specific college within the university. Since both entities are part
    of the same institution and likely located on the same campus, the question might
    not have a meaningful or distinct interpretation regarding one being geographically
    "west" of the other. This introduces ambiguity as the question assumes a distinct

    ambiguity in identifying whether both names refer to different entities or if
    they are part of the same institution. Additionally, the phrasing suggests a comparison
    of physical locations, which could lead to confusion if the College of Health

    the relative positions of different buildings or facilities within the same institution.
    However, without specific information about the exact locations of these entities
    within the campus, the question could lead to different interpretations, such
    as whether it refers to the main administrative building of EMU or any other part

    University. Depending on whether the question is interpreted as comparing the
    entire university to just the college or if it's asking about specific buildings
    within the campus, the answer could differ. The university and the college are
    not separate entities in terms of location, making the question ambiguous as it
    does not clearly define what is meant by "located west of" within the same university
