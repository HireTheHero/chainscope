    former is located south of the latter. The question is specific and geographic
    in nature, and it does not allow for multiple interpretations. The only task is
    to verify the geographic positions of these two locations relative to each other.
    The answer will either be yes or no based on geographic data, thus leading to
    a single correct answer.'
  - 'The question asks about the geographical relationship between two specific structures:
    the Cathedral of St Bavo in Haarlem and the Ronde Lutherse Kerk. The question
    is straightforward in terms of its structure and intent, as it seeks to determine
    whether one location is south of another. However, it is ambiguous because it
    does not specify the reference point or how the south direction is being defined
    (e.g., true south, magnetic south, or relative south based on a map orientation).
    Additionally, without a specific map or coordinate reference, the answer might
    vary depending on the perspective or mapping system used.'
  - The question asks whether the Cathedral of St Bavo in Haarlem is located south
    of Ronde Lutherse Kerk. The interpretation hinges on the geographical locations
    of these two specific structures. There is only one correct geographical answer

  - 'The question is asking for a geographical comparison between two specific locations:
    Hvalsey Church and USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77). Hvalsey Church is a historical site
    located in Greenland. However, the USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77) is a ship, not a fixed
    location. Ships can move, and without additional context specifying the current
    or relevant location of the USCGC Escanaba, the question is ambiguous. The interpretation
    of the question could vary depending on the assumed location of the ship, which
    could lead to different answers.'
  - 'The question asks about the relative location of Hvalsey Church in comparison
    to USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77). This could be interpreted in two ways: 1) If the question
    is asking about the geographical positions of Hvalsey Church and the historical
    location of USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77) when it was in service, then it may have a
    definitive answer. 2) If the question is asking about the current location of
    the ship (if it exists in a different form or location now), it could be ambiguous
    as the current location might vary. Therefore, the question could lead to different
    interpretations based on the context of the ship''s location. Additionally, the
    phrasing does not clarify whether it refers to the ship''s last known location
    or its operational area during its service, which adds to the ambiguity.'
  - The question asks whether Hvalsey Church is located south of USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77).
    To determine if this question is clear or ambiguous, we need to consider the specificity
    and potential for multiple interpretations. Hvalsey Church is a specific location
    in Greenland, and its geographical coordinates are fixed. USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77)
    refers to a specific United States Coast Guard cutter, which would have a particular
    location at a given time. However, without a specified time or location for the
    USCGC Escanaba, the question becomes ambiguous. The ship can change location,
    and without a specific reference point in time, its position relative to Hvalsey
    Church is unclear. Therefore, the question can lead to different answers depending
    on the assumed location of the USCGC Escanaba.
  - The question asks whether Hvalsey Church is located south of USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77).
    However, the question is ambiguous because it does not specify the current or
    a specific historical location of the USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77), which is a ship
    and can move, therefore having different positions at different times. Without
    a fixed reference point for the ship, the question can lead to different interpretations
    depending on the location of the ship at the time of comparison.
  - The question asks about the relative location of Hvalsey Church in relation to
    USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77). Hvalsey Church is a known historical site located in
    Greenland. USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77) was a United States Coast Guard cutter that
    was sunk during World War II. The question is asking for a geographic comparison
    between a stationary historical site and a shipwreck location. The interpretation
    of the question hinges on understanding the specific geographic locations involved,
    and it can be answered definitively based on historical and geographic data. Therefore,
    it admits only one interpretation and one correct answer.
  - The question asks about the relative location of Hvalsey Church in relation to
    USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77). The question can be interpreted clearly by identifying
    the geographical location of both entities. Hvalsey Church is located in Greenland,
    and the USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77) was a United States Coast Guard cutter. However,
    the USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77) was sunk in 1943, so it does not have a current location.
    This creates ambiguity because the reference to its location is not clear, as
    it depends on the historical or operational context of the ship before it sank.
    Thus, the question could be interpreted differently depending on the time frame
    considered for the ship's location.
  - The question asks whether Hvalsey Church is located south of the USCGC Escanaba
    (WPG-77). The interpretation of the question depends on the location of the USCGC
    Escanaba (WPG-77) at a specific point in time, as ships are mobile and can change
    locations. Without specifying the time or position of the ship, the question is
    ambiguous because the answer could vary depending on the ship's location at any
    given time.
  - The question asks if Hvalsey Church is located south of USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77).
    To answer this, one would need to know the current or last known location of the
    USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77). If the location of the USCGC Escanaba is fixed or known,
    the question is clear. However, since ships move, the location of USCGC Escanaba
    could vary, leading to different interpretations of the question at different
    times or circumstances. Therefore, without a specific time frame or location context
    for the USCGC Escanaba, the question admits more than one interpretation.
  - The question asks if Hvalsey Church is located south of the USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77).
    Hvalsey Church is a specific historical site in Greenland, and its location is
    fixed. However, the USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77) was a U.S. Coast Guard cutter that
    served during World War II and was sunk in 1943. Since the ship is not currently
    located in a fixed position, it could be interpreted to refer to either its location
    while it was in service or its current resting place on the ocean floor. These
    two interpretations could lead to different answers regarding whether Hvalsey
    Church is south of the ship. Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation
    based on the reference point for the ship's location.
  - The question asks if Hvalsey Church is located south of USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77).
    The interpretation of the question depends on knowing the current or historical
    location of USCGC Escanaba, a ship, which can move. If the question refers to
    the ship's last known position, the answer could vary based on when the position
    was recorded. Without specifying a time or context for the ship's location, the
    question is ambiguous.

  - The question asks whether St. Benedictusberg Abbey is located south of Villa Empain.
    This requires geographical knowledge about the locations of the two structures.
    The question assumes there is only one St. Benedictusberg Abbey and one Villa
    Empain, and seeks a straightforward geographical relationship between them. However,
    the question could be ambiguous if there are multiple locations known by these
    names or if the definition of "south" is unclear (e.g., direct south vs. general
    southern direction). Since these names likely refer to specific and well-known
    structures, the question is more likely to be clear if the context is understood
    correctly.

  - The question is asking about the geographical location of Hilton Cardiff in relation
    to Chelsea Old Church. While it might seem straightforward, the question is ambiguous
    because "south of" is relative and can depend on the specific point of reference
    or the method used to determine what "south" means (e.g., in terms of latitude
    or other spatial considerations). Additionally, the locations are in different
    cities (Cardiff and London), which adds to the complexity of determining a simple
    directional answer without additional context or criteria for measurement.
  - 'The question asks if a specific location, Hilton Cardiff, is located south of
    another specific location, Chelsea Old Church. The question is clear in what it

    and scale. Without additional information about what "south" refers to, such as
    the specific point of reference or the intended scale (e.g., within a city, country,
    or globally), the question can be interpreted in multiple ways. For instance,
    it could mean south in a local context (within a city) or in a broader geographical
    context (across countries). The lack of precision in the question makes it open
    to different interpretations regarding what "south" means in this context.
  - 'The question "Is Hilton Cardiff located south of Chelsea Old Church?" is asking

    starting and ending points or the map projection used. Furthermore, the question
    doesn''t clarify whether it is asking for a direct southward direction or if it
    is considering any possible travel path. Additionally, without specific coordinates
    or further context, there could be confusion about what "south" means in this
    context, especially considering the distance between Cardiff (in Wales) and Chelsea
    (in London). Therefore, multiple interpretations could arise regarding the scope
    and nature of the "south" direction being questioned.'
  - The question asks if the Hilton Cardiff is located south of Chelsea Old Church.
    The interpretation depends on geographic coordinates. However, the question could
    be seen as ambiguous because it does not specify which type of "south" is being

    the context or scale (e.g., city level or global level) is not defined, which
    could affect how one determines "south." Nevertheless, given the general understanding
    of geographical directions, one could argue that the question is asking if Hilton
    Cardiff is geographically south of Chelsea Old Church, which has a single correct
    answer based on their respective locations.

  - 'The question asks if St. John the Baptist Cathedral in Santorini is located south
    of San Clemente Dam. This question is ambiguous because it involves two different
    locations that are not typically compared. St. John the Baptist Cathedral is in
    Santorini, Greece, and San Clemente Dam is in California, USA. The question could
    be interpreted in different ways: either geographically or in terms of cardinal
    directions based on specific coordinates. The lack of clarity in the context makes
    the question open to multiple interpretations.'
  - The question asks about the geographical location of St. John the Baptist Cathedral
    in Santorini relative to the San Clemente Dam. However, there is a potential ambiguity
    here because "San Clemente Dam" refers to a specific location in California, USA,
    and "St. John the Baptist Cathedral" could potentially refer to multiple churches
    with similar names around the world. Additionally, Santorini is in Greece, which
    is not in close proximity to California, making the question seem geographically
    incongruent. Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation depending
    on the intended reference for "San Clemente Dam" and "St. John the Baptist Cathedral."
  - 'The question is asking for the relative location of St. John the Baptist Cathedral
    in Santorini with respect to the San Clemente Dam. This question admits only one

    locations on a map.'
  - The question "Is St. John the Baptist Cathedral, Santorini located south of San
    Clemente Dam?" is ambiguous. It involves geographical locations, but the interpretation
    can vary because "St. John the Baptist Cathedral" could refer to multiple cathedrals
    with similar names around the world, and "San Clemente Dam" is a specific location
    in California. The question does not specify which "St. John the Baptist Cathedral"
    is being referred to. Additionally, the use of "south of" could pertain to a broad
    range of directions depending on the scale of the map or the specific point of
    reference used for "south." Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation
    regarding the locations being compared.
  - 'The question is asking for the geographical location of St. John the Baptist
    Cathedral in relation to San Clemente Dam. The interpretation of the question
    is straightforward: it seeks to determine whether the cathedral is situated to

    question has a straightforward interpretation, aiming to determine the relative
    positioning of these two locations on a map. The question can only be interpreted
    in one way, and there is one correct answer based on the geographical coordinates
    of the two locations.'
  - 'The question "Is St. John the Baptist Cathedral, Santorini located south of San
    Clemente Dam?" is ambiguous. It involves two geographic locations: St. John the
    Baptist Cathedral in Santorini, Greece, and San Clemente Dam, which was located
    in California, USA. The question could be interpreted in multiple ways due to
    the lack of specific context regarding the meaning of "south." If interpreted
    strictly in terms of cardinal directions, the question is clear, as Santorini
    is indeed south of the location of the former San Clemente Dam. However, if the
    question implies a more localized or specific geographical context, it could lead
    to different interpretations. Furthermore, the dam was demolished, which might
    also affect interpretations regarding current or historical locations.'
  - The question asks whether a specific location, St. John the Baptist Cathedral
    in Santorini, is located south of another location, San Clemente Dam. The question
    seems to involve a geographical comparison between two specific points. However,
    the question is ambiguous because "Santorini" refers to a Greek island, while
    "San Clemente Dam" is located in California, USA. Given these are in entirely
    different regions and not typically compared, the interpretation of "south" could
    be unclear without additional context. Furthermore, the question may assume some
    geographical proximity or context that is not evident in the information provided.
  - 'The question is asking about the geographical location of St. John the Baptist
    Cathedral in Santorini in relation to San Clemente Dam. However, there is an inherent
    ambiguity because "Santorini" is an island in Greece, and the question does not
    specify whether it is referring to a cathedral actually located on Santorini or
    elsewhere. Furthermore, "San Clemente Dam" is located in California, USA. The
    question could be interpreted in two ways: either it is asking if there is a cathedral
    named St. John the Baptist in Santorini that is south of San Clemente Dam, or
    it is mistakenly conflating locations and the question is nonsensical. Due to
    these potential interpretations and geographical inconsistencies, the question
    is ambiguous.'

  - The question asks whether a specific rocket launch station is located south of
    a particular stadium. This question presupposes that both the "Stasiun Peluncuran
    Roket" and "Gelora Delta Stadium" are well-defined and identifiable locations.
    If these are known and fixed locations, the question is clear as it seeks a straightforward
    geographical relationship between the two. However, if there are multiple locations
    with similar names or if the names are not commonly recognized, this could introduce
    ambiguity. Without additional context, it's unclear whether the question refers
    to specific and well-known places.
  - The question asks about the geographical location of "Stasiun Peluncuran Roket"
    in relation to "Gelora Delta Stadium." Without additional context, it's unclear
    which specific rocket launch station or stadium is being referred to, as there

    for multiple interpretations, as different locations could lead to different answers.
  - The question asks whether "Stasiun Peluncuran Roket" is located south of "Gelora
    Delta Stadium." For this question to be classified as CLEAR, the locations mentioned
    must be identifiable with specific, unambiguous geographical coordinates or descriptions.
    However, without additional context or specific knowledge of the locations referred
    to by these names, it is not possible to determine their relative positions. The
    names "Stasiun Peluncuran Roket" and "Gelora Delta Stadium" could refer to multiple
    places worldwide or fictional locations, leading to multiple interpretations.
    Thus, the question is AMBIGUOUS as it stands without further context.
  - The question asks whether a specific location, "Stasiun Peluncuran Roket," is
    situated south of another specific location, "Gelora Delta Stadium." For this
    question to be clear, both locations must be uniquely identifiable and their geographical
    positions must be known. However, the question does not provide sufficient context
    or information to determine the precise identity or location of "Stasiun Peluncuran
    Roket" or "Gelora Delta Stadium," as these names could refer to multiple places
    or be fictional. Without additional context or specific geographical data, the
    question can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on which locations are
    being referenced. Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation,
    which could lead to different answers.
  - The question asks about the relative location of "Stasiun Peluncuran Roket" in
    relation to "Gelora Delta Stadium." However, it does not specify where these two
    locations are, nor does it clarify if these are real or fictional places. Without
    additional context or knowledge of the specific locations being referred to, it
    is unclear if the question pertains to real-world geography or another context
    entirely. Therefore, the question can be interpreted in multiple ways depending
    on the context or assumed knowledge about the locations mentioned.
  - The question asks about the relative location of Stasiun Peluncuran Roket in relation
    to Gelora Delta Stadium. For the question to be clear, both locations should be
    well-defined, and their geographical positions should be known. However, without
    specific knowledge of these locations or additional context (such as the city
    or country they are in), the question could be interpreted in different ways.

    and their relative positions can be ascertained with available geographical data,
    the question would be clear. However, if there is ambiguity in identifying these
    locations or if there are multiple places with similar names, leading to different
    interpretations of what is being asked, the question would be ambiguous. Without
    additional context or clarification about the specific locations referred to,
    this question could be considered ambiguous due to potential uncertainties in
    the identification of "Stasiun Peluncuran Roket" and "Gelora Delta Stadium".
  - The question asks whether "Stasiun Peluncuran Roket" is located south of "Gelora
    Delta Stadium." To determine if the question is clear or ambiguous, we need to
    consider if there is only one interpretation of the locations mentioned. The question
    is specific in its inquiry about the relative geographic position of two distinct
    places. As long as the names of these places are unique and there is a known geographic
    relationship between them, the question would be clear. However, if either "Stasiun
    Peluncuran Roket" or "Gelora Delta Stadium" could refer to multiple locations,
    or if their geographic positions are not well-documented, the question could be
    ambiguous. Without additional context or information about these locations, it
    is difficult to definitively classify the question as CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS. However,
    given that the question seems to assume a specific and unique context, it leans
    towards being AMBIGUOUS due to potential variations in interpretation regarding
    the names and their locations.
  - The question asks whether "Stasiun Peluncuran Roket" is located south of "Gelora
    Delta Stadium." For this question to be clear, both locations must be well-defined

    one correct answer based on their geographical positions. However, if either location
    is not well-defined or could refer to multiple places, the question could be considered
    ambiguous. Without additional context, it is unclear if these are unique, well-known
    places or if they could be interpreted in multiple ways.

  - The question asks about the relative location of Hamilton Palace in relation to
    Motherwell Cathedral. This question is seeking a specific geographical relationship
    between two landmarks. However, the ambiguity arises because Hamilton Palace,
    once located in Hamilton, Scotland, was demolished in the 1920s. Therefore, if
    one interprets "Hamilton Palace" to mean the original historical building, it
    no longer exists to be located south of anything. Alternatively, if someone interprets
    "Hamilton Palace" as referring to the site where it once stood, the question could
    have a definitive answer. This potential for different interpretations (original
    building versus site) leads to ambiguity in answering the question.
  - The question asks about the geographical location of Hamilton Palace in relation
    to Motherwell Cathedral. While it may seem straightforward, there is potential
    ambiguity because the original Hamilton Palace, once located near Hamilton, South
    Lanarkshire, Scotland, was demolished in the 1920s. Therefore, the question could
    be interpreted as asking about the historical location of the original palace
    or any modern-day reference to it, such as a new or different structure named
    Hamilton Palace. Without additional context, there is room for multiple interpretations
    regarding what "Hamilton Palace" refers to, which affects the answer.
  - 'The question asks if Hamilton Palace is located south of Motherwell Cathedral.
    On the surface, this seems like a straightforward geographical question that should
    have a clear answer based on the relative locations of Hamilton Palace and Motherwell
    Cathedral. However, ambiguity arises because Hamilton Palace, as it once existed,
    was demolished in the 1920s. Therefore, the question could be interpreted in two
    ways: one might consider the historical location of the palace, or one might interpret
    the question as asking about a currently existing structure. The interpretation
    of "Hamilton Palace" could lead to different answers depending on whether one
    considers the historical site or assumes a different meaning altogether.'

    question does not introduce any ambiguity in terms of interpretation.'
  - The question is asking about the geographical location of Hamilton Palace in relation
    to Motherwell Cathedral. This question is ambiguous because it depends on which
    Hamilton Palace is being referred to. There is a historical Hamilton Palace that
    was located in South Lanarkshire, Scotland, which is now demolished, and there
    might be other places or structures with similar names elsewhere. Without specific
    context or clarification regarding which Hamilton Palace is being referred to,
    the question could lead to different interpretations and answers.
  - The question asks about the geographical relationship between Hamilton Palace
    and Motherwell Cathedral. However, there is ambiguity in the question because
    "Hamilton Palace" can refer to more than one location or historical reference.
    The original Hamilton Palace, which was a grand estate in Hamilton, South Lanarkshire,
    Scotland, was demolished in the 1920s. Without additional context, it's unclear
    whether the question refers to this historical site or another location with a
    similar name. Additionally, the phrasing "located south of" does not specify the
    distance or scale of the reference, which might lead to different interpretations
    of what "south" means in this context.
  - The question asks about the geographical relationship between Hamilton Palace
    and Motherwell Cathedral, specifically whether Hamilton Palace is located south
    of Motherwell Cathedral. This is a straightforward inquiry about relative location
    and does not present multiple interpretations. Therefore, it admits only one interpretation
    and one correct answer based on geographical data.
  - 'The question asks if Hamilton Palace is located south of Motherwell Cathedral.
    While this seems like a straightforward geographical question, there is an ambiguity
    because Hamilton Palace no longer exists; it was demolished in the early 20th
    century. This could lead to different interpretations: one might answer based
    on historical locations (where Hamilton Palace used to be) or might consider the
    question invalid due to the non-existence of Hamilton Palace today. Therefore,
    the question admits more than one interpretation, which could lead to different
    answers.'
  - The question asks about the geographical location of Hamilton Palace in relation
    to Motherwell Cathedral. The interpretation hinges on the specific locations of
    these two landmarks. If both are well-defined and their relative positions are
    known, the question is clear with one correct answer based on geographic data.
    However, if there is any ambiguity about what "Hamilton Palace" refers to (as
    there could be multiple structures with similar names, or if it no longer exists),
    the question could become ambiguous. Historically, Hamilton Palace in Scotland
    was demolished, which might add to potential confusion. Yet, if interpreted strictly
    as a historical or geographic inquiry with the assumption of well-known locations,
    it should remain clear.

    of both the Wyoming State Capitol, which is in Cheyenne, Wyoming, USA, and Casa
    do Infante, which is in Porto, Portugal. Once these locations are established,
    it is clear that Cheyenne is located north of Porto. Therefore, the question admits
    only one interpretation and one correct answer.
  - 'The question involves determining the geographical locations of two specific
    places: the Wyoming State Capitol and Casa do Infante. The Wyoming State Capitol
    is in Cheyenne, Wyoming, USA, and Casa do Infante is in Porto, Portugal. There

  - The question asks about the relative location of the Wyoming State Capitol and
    Casa do Infante. While it seems to be a straightforward geographical question,
    there are a couple of ambiguities. First, "south" could be interpreted in terms
    of direct geographical latitude, but it could also be interpreted relative to
    specific maps or projections, which might alter the answer. Additionally, without
    specific coordinates or a clear understanding of what is meant by "south" in this
    context, it could be interpreted differently. Moreover, the question assumes a
    knowledge of the exact locations of both the Wyoming State Capitol and Casa do
    Infante, and without this information being explicitly provided, there might be
    ambiguity in determining the answer. Therefore, due to these potential interpretations,
    the question is ambiguous.

    as the locations are fixed and the relationship is clearly defined in terms of
    direction.
  - The question asks whether the UCCU Center is located south of Hershey Theatre.
    This question involves geographical locations and directions. However, it is ambiguous
    because it does not specify which UCCU Center (as there may be multiple with that
    name) or which Hershey Theatre is being referred to (there could be more than
    one or it could be a location in a specific city). Without additional context
    to specify the exact locations, the question admits more than one interpretation
    and could lead to different answers.
  - The question asks if the UCCU Center is located south of Hershey Theatre. The
    interpretation of "south" is generally straightforward, referring to a cardinal

  - The question asks about the relative location of Euston St Pancras railway station
    and Lord's tube station. However, there is a potential ambiguity in the question.
    First, there is no station known as "Euston St Pancras" - there are separate stations
    named Euston Station and St Pancras International. Second, there is no station
    known as "Lord's tube station" - this could refer to a location near Lord's Cricket
    Ground, but there is no specific tube station by that name. The ambiguity arises
    from the unclear references to the stations in question, leading to multiple interpretations
    about which locations are being compared.
  - The question asks about the geographical relationship between Euston St Pancras
    railway station and Lord's tube station. However, there is an ambiguity in the
    question. "Euston St Pancras railway station" is not a single station; rather,
    there are separate stations named Euston and St Pancras in London. Additionally,
    "Lord's tube station" is not a recognized station name. There is a Lord's Cricket
    Ground, which is near St John's Wood station. The lack of clarity about the specific
    stations and locations being referred to makes the question ambiguous.
  - 'The question is asking about the geographical relationship between Euston St
    Pancras railway station and Lord''s tube station, specifically whether the former
    is located south of the latter. However, there is an inherent ambiguity because
    there is no station officially named "Euston St Pancras railway station." Euston
    and St Pancras are two separate stations in London. Therefore, the question can
    be interpreted in multiple ways: it could be referring to Euston station or St
    Pancras station individually, which could lead to different answers regarding
    their locations relative to Lord''s tube station. Without clarification on which
    station is meant, the question remains ambiguous.'
  - 'The question asks whether Euston St Pancras railway station is located south
    of Lord''s tube station. However, there is an ambiguity in the phrasing because
    there is no railway station specifically known as "Euston St Pancras." There are
    two distinct stations: Euston station and St Pancras International station, both
    of which are in close proximity to each other in London. The question could be
    interpreted as asking about either Euston station or St Pancras International
    station. This ambiguity in identifying which specific station is being referred
    to leads to different possible interpretations and answers.'
  - 'The question asks about the geographical relationship between two specific locations:
    Euston St Pancras railway station and Lord''s tube station. However, there is
    ambiguity in the question due to the reference to "Euston St Pancras railway station,"

  - The question asks about the geographical location of Falcon International Reservoir
    in relation to JFK Medical Center in Atlantis, Florida. It seems to be asking
    if the reservoir is located to the south of this medical center. However, the
    ambiguity arises because there is no well-known Falcon International Reservoir,
    and the question does not specify which Falcon International Reservoir it is referring
    to. Additionally, without clear context or specific geographic identifiers, it's
    unclear whether the question is about a real-world location or perhaps a fictional
    or hypothetical scenario. This lack of clarity about the entities involved makes
    the question ambiguous.
  - The question is AMBIGUOUS because "south of" can be interpreted in different ways
    depending on the context. It could refer to the relative geographical position
    on a map, but without specific longitudinal or latitudinal coordinates, the interpretation
    can vary. Additionally, the question assumes the existence of a specific "Falcon
    International Reservoir," which may not be a well-known or universally recognized
    location, adding further ambiguity. Lastly, "JFK Medical Center" could be interpreted
    as multiple locations if not specifically defined as the one in Atlantis, Florida.
  - 'The question is asking for the geographical relationship between Falcon International
    Reservoir and JFK Medical Center in Atlantis, Florida. The question is clear in
    its intent, as it seeks to determine if one specific location (Falcon International
    Reservoir) is south of another specific location (JFK Medical Center in Atlantis,
    Florida). The interpretation of "south of" is a straightforward geographical query,
    assuming both locations are well-defined. Therefore, this question admits only
    one interpretation: a geographical positioning query.'
  - The question asks whether the Falcon International Reservoir is located south
    of JFK Medical Center in Atlantis, Florida. The question is geographically specific
    and seeks a straightforward location-based answer. However, the ambiguity arises
    from the fact that Falcon International Reservoir is not a well-known location
    and might not exist, leading to multiple interpretations. Additionally, there
    could be multiple JFK Medical Centers, and the question does not specify which
    one, despite mentioning Atlantis, Florida, which adds another layer of ambiguity.
  - The question asks if Falcon International Reservoir is located south of JFK Medical
    Center in Atlantis, Florida. The question is potentially ambiguous for a couple
    of reasons. First, "Falcon International Reservoir" could refer to more than one
    location, depending on the context or region. Second, the question assumes there
    is a known and fixed location for JFK Medical Center, but without additional context,
    it's unclear if the person is referring to a specific location in Atlantis, Florida,
    or potentially another location with a similar name. These ambiguities could lead
    to different interpretations and answers.
  - The question is asking about the geographical location of Falcon International
    Reservoir in relation to JFK Medical Center in Atlantis, Florida. The question
    could be interpreted as asking whether the reservoir is geographically south of

    named "Falcon International Reservoir" existing, as well as the specificity of
    what "south" entails (directly south, generally south, etc.). Additionally, the
    wording does not specify if it is asking about a linear distance or a general
    directional sense. Without more context, it could lead to different interpretations
    and answers.
  - The question asks whether the Falcon International Reservoir is located south
    of JFK Medical Center in Atlantis, Florida. The question is ambiguous because
    "Falcon International Reservoir" is not a widely recognized name and could refer
    to multiple locations. Additionally, the question assumes a geographic context
    that may not exist, as there is no well-known Falcon International Reservoir near
    Atlantis, Florida. Thus, the interpretation of the question could vary based on
    different assumptions about the location and naming of the reservoir.
  - The question is asking about the relative location of Falcon International Reservoir
    in relation to JFK Medical Center in Atlantis, Florida. The interpretation depends
    on whether "Falcon International Reservoir" refers to a specific and well-known
    location. If Falcon International Reservoir is a known location with a fixed position,
    the question can be answered clearly based on geographical data. However, if Falcon
    International Reservoir is not a well-established name for a specific location,
    the question becomes ambiguous as there may be multiple places with similar names
    or no known place by that exact name. Additionally, the question's phrasing could
    imply searching for a relative direction (south) which is clear if both locations
    are well-defined. Without clear definitions or widely recognized references, the
    question admits multiple interpretations regarding the identity of Falcon International
    Reservoir.
  - The question asks about the location of Falcon International Reservoir relative
    to JFK Medical Center in Atlantis, Florida. The question is straightforward and
    seeks to determine the relative geographic positions of these two locations. There
    is only one interpretation, which involves checking the geographic coordinates
    or map to see if the reservoir is indeed located south of the medical center.
    Therefore, this question admits one interpretation and one correct answer.
  - The question asks whether Falcon International Reservoir is located south of JFK
    Medical Center in Atlantis, Florida. The question is geographically specific and
    straightforward, asking for a relative location between two entities. However,
    there could be ambiguity due to the fact that "Falcon International Reservoir"
    might refer to different places or may not exist, and "JFK Medical Center" could
    also refer to different facilities in various locations. Additionally, the question
    implies a need for precise geographic knowledge that may not be universally available
    or easily verified, leading to different interpretations of what constitutes "south"
    in this context.

    High School is in New South Wales. The question does not specify if it is asking
    about a particular map, context, or if there is an assumed connection between
    these two locations. Therefore, the question could be interpreted in different
    ways, such as whether it is asking for a relative location in a hypothetical scenario
    or real-world geography.
  - The question asks if Cherrybrook Technology High School is located south of RM
    Williams Way. However, it does not specify where RM Williams Way is located. Without
    this information, it is unclear whether the question is about geographical orientation

  - The question asks whether San Carlos BioPower is located south of Marth Mariam
    Cathedral. To answer this question, one needs specific geographical knowledge
    about the relative positions of these two locations. The question is clear in
    its request for a spatial relationship between two defined points. However, the
    ambiguity arises from the fact that "Marth Mariam Cathedral" could refer to multiple
    cathedrals around the world, as it is a common name for churches in the Christian
    tradition, particularly in regions where the Syriac or Indian Orthodox churches
    are present. Without specifying which Marth Mariam Cathedral is being referred
    to, the question admits multiple interpretations, each leading to potentially
    different answers depending on which cathedral is considered.

    Mariam Cathedral is being considered.
  - The question asks if San Carlos BioPower is located south of Marth Mariam Cathedral.
    To determine if the question is clear or ambiguous, we need to consider whether
    the locations are specified unambiguously. If there is only one known San Carlos
    BioPower and one Marth Mariam Cathedral, and their geographical positions relative
    to each other are clearly defined, the question would be clear. However, if there
    are multiple locations with these names, or if their relative positions are not
    well-defined or widely known, the question could be interpreted in multiple ways,
    leading to ambiguity.
  - The question asks whether San Carlos BioPower is located south of Marth Mariam
    Cathedral. This question is clear because it involves determining the relative

  - The question asks whether San Carlos BioPower is located south of Marth Mariam
    Cathedral. The question implies a spatial relationship between two specific locations.
    For this question to be clear, the names of the locations must be unique and identifiable,
    which they are not. There could be multiple places with similar names across different
    regions or countries. Without additional context or specific geographic identifiers,
    it's unclear which San Carlos BioPower or Marth Mariam Cathedral is being referenced.
    This lack of specificity leads to multiple possible interpretations of the locations
    being compared.
  - The question asks if San Carlos BioPower is located south of Marth Mariam Cathedral.
    To answer this, one would need to determine the geographical locations of both
    San Carlos BioPower and Marth Mariam Cathedral and compare their positions relative

    the existence and specific locations of both places, but it does not specify which
    Marth Mariam Cathedral is being referred to, as there could be multiple cathedrals
    with that name worldwide. Without additional context specifying which Marth Mariam
    Cathedral is in question, the interpretation of the question can vary, leading
    to different answers depending on the location of the cathedral being considered.
  - The question asks if San Carlos BioPower is located south of Marth Mariam Cathedral.
    While the question is specific, it could be interpreted in more than one way because

  - 'The question asks whether the Everett McKinley Dirksen United States Courthouse
    is located south of Santi Nereo e Achilleo. This question is geographically specific,
    involving two distinct locations: one in Chicago, USA, and the other in Rome,
    Italy. The interpretation of "south" is straightforward in geographical terms,
    as it refers to a position on the Earth''s surface relative to another. However,
    the question could be interpreted in two different ways: whether the courthouse
    is south relative to a direct path between the two locations, or in terms of their
    absolute latitudinal positions. Despite these potential interpretations, both

    in relation to Pearl Palace. However, without specific context or universally
    recognized reference points, the terms "Hotel Continental" and "Pearl Palace"
    could refer to different places in various regions or cities. Additionally, without
    a map or specific geographical data, it's not clear if there is only one Hotel
    Continental and one Pearl Palace, and if they have fixed positions relative to
    each other. Therefore, the question could be interpreted differently depending
    on the context or additional information about these locations.
  - The question asks about the relative location of Hotel Continental in Tangier
    with respect to Pearl Palace. However, without specific knowledge of the locations
    of these two places, it could be interpreted in multiple ways because the question
    does not specify which Pearl Palace it is referring to. There might be more than
    one Pearl Palace in different cities or countries, leading to different interpretations
    and potentially different answers. Therefore, the question admits more than one
    interpretation.
  - The question asks about the relative location of Hotel Continental in Tangier
    concerning the Pearl Palace. The ambiguity arises because there is no universally
    recognized "Pearl Palace" in Tangier, and multiple places could be referred to

    "Pearl Palace" refers to, the question could lead to different interpretations
    and answers. Therefore, it is ambiguous.
  - The question asks about the relative location of the Hotel Continental in Tangier
    and the Pearl Palace. For this question to be clear, there must be a single, unambiguous
    reference point for the location of both structures in relation to each other.
    However, without specific geographic coordinates or additional context about what
    "south" refers to, it is possible to interpret this question in more than one
    way, especially if there are multiple structures named similarly or if the location
    of these structures is not well known. Thus, the question could lead to different
    interpretations and answers depending on the available information or assumptions
    made by the respondent.
  - 'The question is asking about the geographic relationship between two specific
    locations: Hotel Continental in Tangier and Pearl Palace. The ambiguity arises

    a specific Pearl Palace to reference, the question can be interpreted in multiple
    ways, leading to different answers depending on which Pearl Palace is considered.'
  - The question asks for the relative location of the Hotel Continental in Tangier
    with respect to the Pearl Palace. The interpretation of "south of" is straightforward,
    and it asks for a specific geographical relationship between two places. However,
    without clear and publicly available information about the exact location of both
    the Hotel Continental and the Pearl Palace, or if there are multiple places with
    similar names, the answer could vary. Additionally, without specifying which Pearl
    Palace (if there are multiple), this could lead to different interpretations.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative location of two specific places: Hotel
    Continental in Tangier and Pearl Palace. The ambiguity arises from the lack of

    are on different continents, making the concept of "south" in a direct geographical
    sense unclear without a specified context (e.g., within a specific region or map
    projection). Therefore, the question could be interpreted in different ways based
    on how one considers geographical directions across long distances or different
    map projections.
  - The question asks about the geographical relationship between Kaibab Lake and
    Buffavento Castle, specifically whether Kaibab Lake is located south of Buffavento

  - The question asks whether the Tianjin Modern City Office Tower is located south
    of Sugar Pine Reservoir. The ambiguity arises because Tianjin Modern City Office
    Tower is located in Tianjin, China, and Sugar Pine Reservoir is in California,
    USA. Therefore, the question might be interpreted as comparing two unrelated geographical
    points that are extremely far apart, which could lead to confusion about the context
    or intent behind the question. Additionally, the question does not specify which
    specific "south" direction (considering global coordinates and hemispheres) it
    is referring to, adding to the ambiguity.
  - 'The question asks if the Tianjin Modern City Office Tower is located south of

  - The question asks whether the Tianjin Modern City Office Tower is located south
    of Sugar Pine Reservoir. The interpretation of the question seems clear at first
    glance, as it involves determining the geographical relationship between two specific
    locations. However, there is ambiguity because "Tianjin Modern City Office Tower"
    could refer to any office tower in Tianjin, a large city with many buildings,
    without a specific address or identifier. Additionally, "south of Sugar Pine Reservoir"
    is a relative direction that depends on the specific locations being compared.
    The lack of specific coordinates or additional context to identify the exact tower
    and its geographical position in relation to the reservoir makes the question
    ambiguous.
  - 'The question asks whether the Tianjin Modern City Office Tower is located south

    of the question, which is to determine the geographical relationship between these
    two points. Therefore, it does not admit multiple interpretations that could lead
    to different answers.
  - 'The question asks whether the Tianjin Modern City Office Tower is located south
    of the Sugar Pine Reservoir. This question is ambiguous because it involves two
    potentially unclear elements: the location of the Tianjin Modern City Office Tower,
    which is in Tianjin, China, and the Sugar Pine Reservoir, which is in California,
    USA. The geographical locations of these two places are widely separated, and
    the question could be interpreted in different ways based on the assumption of
    either a relative local positioning or a global map context. This leads to different
    interpretations and potential confusion over what is being asked.'
  - The question is asking about the geographical location of the Tianjin Modern City
    Office Tower in relation to Sugar Pine Reservoir. The interpretation depends on

  - 'The question asks whether the Tianjin Modern City Office Tower is located south
    of Sugar Pine Reservoir. The question is geographically specific, mentioning two
    distinct places: the Tianjin Modern City Office Tower and the Sugar Pine Reservoir.
    However, it is ambiguous because "Tianjin Modern City Office Tower" suggests a
    location in Tianjin, China, while "Sugar Pine Reservoir" is in California, USA.
    The question may assume the existence of similarly named locations or an understanding
    of geographic positions across significant distances, leading to multiple interpretations
    about which locations are being referred to. Without additional context, it is
    unclear if the question pertains to a specific locality or involves a broader
    geographic comparison across continents.'
  - The question asks if the Tianjin Modern City Office Tower is located south of
    Sugar Pine Reservoir. The question is AMBIGUOUS because it involves two locations
    that are geographically unrelated or may not have any specific or recognized spatial
    relationship in common geographic knowledge. Sugar Pine Reservoir is in California,
    USA, while Tianjin is in China. The question could be interpreted in different
    ways depending on whether it is asking for a relative geographic position, considering
    the curvature of the Earth, or if it's a conceptual query. The lack of context
    or specificity about the nature of "south" (e.g., directly south, generally south,
    etc.) adds to the ambiguity.
