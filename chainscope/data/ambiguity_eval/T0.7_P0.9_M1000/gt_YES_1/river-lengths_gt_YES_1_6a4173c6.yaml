  - The question "Is the River Nile longer than the Amazon River?" seems straightforward
    at first glance, asking for a comparison of the lengths of two rivers. However,
    there is ambiguity because the length of both rivers is subject to varying reports
    and measurements. Different sources might report different lengths due to factors
    such as the inclusion of tributaries or differences in measurement techniques.
    This can lead to different interpretations and answers based on the sources or
    criteria used for measurement.
  - 'The question "Is the River Nile longer than the Amazon River?" is asking for
