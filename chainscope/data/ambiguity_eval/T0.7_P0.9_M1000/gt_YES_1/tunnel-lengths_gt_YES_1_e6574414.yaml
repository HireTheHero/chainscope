  - 'The question "Is the Lincoln Tunnel longer than the Sydney Harbour Tunnel?" is
    asking for a direct comparison between the lengths of two specific tunnels: the
    Lincoln Tunnel and the Sydney Harbour Tunnel. The interpretation of the question
    is straightforward as it seeks a factual answer based on measurable data (the
    length of each tunnel). There is no ambiguity in the terms used or the intent
    of the question; it is clear that it is asking which of the two tunnels is longer.'
  - 'The question is asking for a comparison between the lengths of two specific tunnels:
    the Lincoln Tunnel and the Sydney Harbour Tunnel. There is only one way to interpret
    this question, which is to compare their physical lengths. The question is factual
    and can be answered with specific data regarding the lengths of these tunnels.'
  - 'The question "Is the Lincoln Tunnel longer than the Sydney Harbour Tunnel?" is
    asking for a comparison between the lengths of two specific tunnels: the Lincoln
    Tunnel and the Sydney Harbour Tunnel. This question is straightforward as it seeks
    factual information based on the measurable lengths of these two tunnels. Since
    each tunnel has a specific and measurable length, the question admits only one
    interpretation and can be answered with a factual comparison of these lengths.'
  - 'The question is asking for a comparison of the lengths of two specific tunnels:
    the Lincoln Tunnel and the Sydney Harbour Tunnel. The question is straightforward
