  - The question asks about the geographical relationship between California South
    Bay University and Apple University, specifically whether the former is located
    east of the latter. However, the question is ambiguous because there are no well-known
    institutions by the names "California South Bay University" or "Apple University"
    in California. This lack of specificity makes it unclear which institutions are
    being referred to, leading to multiple interpretations and potential answers.
    Additionally, "Apple University" could refer to an internal corporate training
    program by Apple Inc., which does not have a physical campus, further contributing
    to the ambiguity.
  - The question asks if California South Bay University is located east of Apple
    University, both in California. The ambiguity arises from the lack of clarity
    about the specific locations of these institutions, as "California South Bay University"
    and "Apple University" could refer to multiple institutions or non-standard names.
    Additionally, the phrasing "located east of" depends on the precise geographical
    coordinates of each institution, which are not provided in the question. Without
    more specific information about these universities, the question admits multiple
    interpretations regarding their locations.
  - The question is asking about the geographical location of California South Bay
    University in relation to Apple University, both of which are located in California.
    The question presumes the existence of a specific "Apple University, CA" that
    can be used for comparison. However, "Apple University" is not a traditional college
    or university but rather an internal training program for Apple Inc., which does
    not have a fixed geographic location like a typical university campus. This creates
    ambiguity because the question could be interpreted as asking about different
    entities or locations related to Apple Inc. Additionally, without clear, established
    locations for these institutions, the question cannot have one definitive answer.
  - The question asks whether California South Bay University is located east of Apple
    University. However, there is ambiguity in this question because "Apple University"
    is not a widely recognized standalone institution with a fixed geographic location.
    It could refer to Apple's internal corporate training program, which does not
    have a fixed campus like a traditional university. Moreover, the question assumes
    both entities have specific, identifiable locations that can be compared geographically,
    which may not be the case. This leads to multiple interpretations and potential
    confusion in providing a definitive answer.
  - The question is asking for the relative geographical positioning of California
    South Bay University and Apple University, both located in California. However,
    the ambiguity arises from the fact that "Apple University" might refer to Apple's
    internal corporate training program rather than an established, location-specific
    educational institution. Without a specific, known location for "Apple University,"
    it is impossible to provide a definitive answer about the relative positions of
    these two entities. Additionally, "California South Bay University" is not a widely
    recognized institution, which adds to the uncertainty and potential for multiple
    interpretations based on different assumptions about these entities' locations.
  - The question asks whether California South Bay University is located east of Apple
    University. However, the question is ambiguous because "Apple University" is not
    a commonly recognized institution or location. Without specific and widely acknowledged
    geographical points or institutions to reference, multiple interpretations can
    arise regarding what "Apple University" refers to, leading to different potential
    answers. Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation and could
    lead to different answers based on the assumed identity and location of "Apple
    University."
  - The question is asking about the relative location of California South Bay University
    in relation to Apple University, both presumably in California. However, the question
    is ambiguous because there is no well-known "Apple University" as a physical campus
    or institution with a fixed geographical location. Apple University is typically
    a term used for an internal training program at Apple Inc. Without a clear and
    common understanding of what "Apple University, CA" refers to, the question can
    be interpreted in multiple ways, leading to different answers depending on the
    assumed location of "Apple University." Therefore, the question admits more than
    one interpretation.
  - The question is asking whether California South Bay University is located east
    of Apple University, both of which are in California. The ambiguity arises because
    there is no widely recognized "California South Bay University" or "Apple University"
    as standalone institutions. Without clear definitions or common knowledge of these
    specific entities, the question can be interpreted in multiple ways, leading to
    different answers depending on the assumptions made about these institutions'
    identities and locations.
  - This question is AMBIGUOUS because "California South Bay University, CA" and "Apple
    University, CA" are not well-known or clearly defined institutions, leading to
    multiple interpretations. Without precise locations or more context about these
    universities, it is unclear where they are situated relative to each other. Additionally,
    "Apple University" could refer to a corporate training program within Apple Inc.,
    rather than a physical university campus, further complicating the question.
  - This question is AMBIGUOUS. Firstly, "California South Bay University" and "Apple
    University" are not well-known or commonly recognized institutions, which raises
    ambiguity about their actual existence or specific locations. Furthermore, without
    specific geographic coordinates or clear definitions of what constitutes "east"
    in this context, the question may lead to different interpretations or require
    assumptions about the locations of these universities. This leads to potential
    variation in answers depending on the interpretation of the question.

    The question is asking whether one is located to the east of the other. However,
    the question is ambiguous because it does not provide specific addresses or campus
    locations for these two entities, and without additional context or precise coordinates,
    the geographical relationship between the two cannot be definitively determined.
    Furthermore, the phrase "located east of" could be interpreted in different ways
    depending on the scope (e.g., within a city, within a campus, or within the state).

  - The question is asking about the geographical location of the College of Health
    and Human Services in relation to Eastern Michigan University. However, the term
    "east of Eastern Michigan University" could be interpreted in different ways.
    It could mean whether the college building is physically situated to the east
    on the campus or in relation to the main campus address, or it could be asking
    about its position relative to another reference point. This ambiguity in the
    interpretation of "east" makes the question open to multiple interpretations and
    potential answers.
  - The question is asking about the geographical location of Eastern Michigan University
    College of Health and Human Services in relation to Eastern Michigan University.
    However, the phrase "east of Eastern Michigan University" can be interpreted in
    multiple ways. It could refer to the main campus of Eastern Michigan University
    or to a specific point within the university's grounds. Additionally, the naming
    of the college itself (Eastern Michigan University College of Health and Human
    Services) suggests it is part of Eastern Michigan University, potentially implying
    it is located within the same general area. Without specific geographic coordinates
    or a clear definition of what constitutes being "east of" the university, the
    question can lead to different interpretations and answers.
  - The question is asking about the geographical location of Eastern Michigan University
    College of Health and Human Services relative to Eastern Michigan University.
    However, the phrasing of the question is somewhat unclear because it uses "east
    of" in a way that could be interpreted in multiple ways. Typically, university
    colleges are part of the main university campus, so the question might imply a
    comparison between two locations that are essentially the same. Without a specific
    definition or context for "east of," there could be confusion about what is being
    asked. The question does not provide sufficient context to determine if the college
    is considered a separate entity from the university or if it refers to a specific
    building or department within the university. Therefore, the question admits more
    than one interpretation, leading to potential different answers based on different
    assumptions.
  - The question asks whether the Eastern Michigan University College of Health and
    Human Services is located east of Eastern Michigan University. The ambiguity arises
    because both the college and the university are part of the same institution,
    Eastern Michigan University, which is located in Ypsilanti, Michigan. The question
    may be attempting to ask about the geographical orientation of a specific building
    or department relative to the main campus, but without specific details or context
    about the campus layout or the location of the College of Health and Human Services
    within it, there is more than one possible interpretation. Therefore, the question
    can lead to different answers based on different assumptions about what is being
    asked.
  - The question asks about the geographical relationship between Eastern Michigan
    University College of Health and Human Services and Eastern Michigan University,
    both presumably located in Michigan. The use of "east of" implies a need for clarity
    regarding the specific locations of these entities. However, the name "Eastern
    Michigan University College of Health and Human Services" suggests it is part
    of Eastern Michigan University, rather than a separate entity with its own distinct
    location. Therefore, the question could be interpreted as asking about the location
    of a department within the university or about two separate entities. This ambiguity
    in interpretation affects the clarity of the question and could lead to different
    answers based on how one interprets the relationship between the college and the
    university.
  - The question asks about the geographical relationship between Eastern Michigan
    University College of Health and Human Services and Eastern Michigan University.
    It is implied that both are part of the same university system, but it is ambiguous
    whether the "College of Health and Human Services" is a separate location or just
    a department within the university. Additionally, the use of "east of Eastern
    Michigan University" is ambiguous because it doesn't specify what reference point
    within the university is being used to determine the direction "east." Without
    a specific reference point or clarification on whether the college is a distinct
    location, the question can lead to multiple interpretations.
  - The question asks if the College of Health and Human Services is located east
    of Eastern Michigan University in Michigan. However, the question is ambiguous
    because it is unclear whether it is asking about the relative geographic location
    of the College of Health and Human Services in relation to the main campus of
    Eastern Michigan University, or if it is referring to whether the College is a
    part of Eastern Michigan University and located on its main campus. Without specifying
    what "east of" refers to, the question can be interpreted in different ways, leading
    to different answers.
  - The question asks about the geographical location of Eastern Michigan University
    College of Health and Human Services in relation to Eastern Michigan University.
    However, it is unclear if "east of Eastern Michigan University, MI" refers to
    a specific part of the university's campus or a general region. Additionally,
    the wording could imply that both are distinct entities, whereas the College of
    Health and Human Services is actually part of Eastern Michigan University. The
    phrasing allows for multiple interpretations regarding what "east of" means in
    this context, leading to potential confusion about the exact spatial relationship
    being queried.
  - 'The question asks about the geographic location of the College of Health and
    Human Services in relation to Eastern Michigan University itself. It is clear
    in what it is asking for: the relative positioning of two specific entities associated
    with Eastern Michigan University. The question assumes that both entities have
    a geographic location that can be compared, which generally is a reasonable assumption
    for a university and its college. There is only one interpretation of the question,
    which is to determine whether one is geographically east of the other.'
  - The question is asking whether the College of Health and Human Services is located
    east of Eastern Michigan University. The use of the term "Eastern" in both names
    could lead to confusion, as it might imply geographical direction rather than
    being part of the institution's name. However, the question is clear in its intent
    to determine the geographical relationship between the two locations. Since there
    is only one interpretation about the geographical positioning of the college relative
    to the main university, the question is clear.

  - The question is about the geographical location of Southern Methodist University
    (SMU) in relation to Meadows School of the Arts, both of which are located in
    Texas. However, Meadows School of the Arts is actually a part of Southern Methodist
    University. This could make the question seem ambiguous because asking if a university
    is located east of a school that is part of itself could lead to confusion. The
    interpretation could be whether the main administration or a specific part of
    the university is east of the Meadows School of the Arts, or it could simply be
    a misunderstanding of their relationship. Given the potential for misunderstanding
    based on how the question is framed, it admits more than one interpretation.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative location of Southern Methodist University
    (SMU) and Meadows School of the Arts, both in Texas. However, Meadows School of
    the Arts is a part of SMU, not a separate entity. This creates ambiguity because
    the question could be interpreted in different ways: it might be asking if the
    main campus of SMU is east of a particular location within the campus, or it might
    be mistakenly treating them as separate entities. Additionally, since both are
    part of the same institution and location, the geographic relationship could be
    unclear or misinterpreted.'
  - The question asks whether Southern Methodist University (SMU) in Texas is located
    east of Meadows School of the Arts in Texas. Meadows School of the Arts is actually
    a part of Southern Methodist University, located on its campus in Dallas, TX.
    The phrasing of the question could lead to confusion because it suggests that
    SMU and Meadows School of the Arts are separate entities when, in reality, they
    are part of the same institution. Therefore, the interpretation of the question
    is ambiguous because it is unclear whether the question is asking about the relative
    location of the university as a whole in relation to one of its schools or if
    it is mistakenly treating them as separate locations. This could lead to different
    answers depending on how the question is interpreted.
  - The question is asking about the geographical location of Southern Methodist University
    (SMU) in relation to the Meadows School of the Arts. However, the Meadows School
    of the Arts is a part of Southern Methodist University, located on the same campus
    in Dallas, Texas. This could lead to confusion as to whether the question is asking
    about the location of the university as a whole compared to a specific part of
    it, or if it's asking about the relative location of two specific places within
    the same campus. The interpretation of the question could vary depending on how
    one views the relationship between the university and the school.
  - The question asks if Southern Methodist University (SMU) in Texas is located east
    of Meadows School of the Arts in Texas. Since Meadows School of the Arts is a
    part of Southern Methodist University, the question is inherently ambiguous. The
    interpretation could be about a specific building within the university or comparing
    two different campuses, which are not specified. Thus, it can lead to different
    answers based on how one interprets the location and relationship between the
    entities mentioned.
  - The question is asking whether Southern Methodist University in Texas is located
    east of Meadows School of the Arts in Texas. Meadows School of the Arts is actually
    a part of Southern Methodist University, which means the locations are essentially
    the same. This makes the question ambiguous, as it could be interpreted in different
    ways. The question could be asking about two separate entities, which would make
    it difficult to provide a clear answer. Additionally, the phrasing could imply
    a misunderstanding of the locations' relationship, leading to different interpretations
    and answers.
  - The question asks about the relative location of Southern Methodist University
    (SMU) in Texas with respect to Meadows School of the Arts, which is actually a
    part of SMU. This creates an inherent ambiguity because one could interpret the
    question as asking about the location of SMU in relation to a particular point
    within its own campus (Meadows School of the Arts). Since Meadows School of the
    Arts is part of SMU, both are located in the same geographic location, making
    the question ambiguous as it doesn't specify what "east of" refers to in the context
    of a single campus. Furthermore, if interpreted literally, it leads to a nonsensical
    question about one part of an entity being located relative to itself.
  - The question asks if Southern Methodist University (SMU) is located east of Meadows
    School of the Arts. However, Meadows School of the Arts is actually a part of
    Southern Methodist University, not a separate location. Therefore, the question

    locations, which could lead to confusion about the interpretation of "east of"
    within the same campus.
  - The question is asking about the geographical location of Southern Methodist University
    (SMU) in relation to Meadows School of the Arts, both of which are situated in
    Texas. However, this question is ambiguous because Meadows School of the Arts
    is actually a part of Southern Methodist University, not a separate location.
    Thus, asking whether one is east of the other within the same campus can be confusing
    and open to interpretation. Additionally, the question assumes that the reader
    knows specific details about the layout of the campus, which might not be universally
    known.
  - The question asks whether Southern Methodist University (SMU) in Texas is located
    east of Meadows School of the Arts in Texas. However, Meadows School of the Arts
    is a part of Southern Methodist University, which makes the question potentially
    confusing. The question could be interpreted as asking about the location of the
    university as a whole relative to a specific part of itself, which is not logical.
    Additionally, if interpreted as asking about different institutions with similar
    names, it could lead to multiple interpretations. Therefore, the question is ambiguous
    because it lacks clarity on what exactly is being compared or located relative
    to one another.

  - The question asks whether Tri-Valley University, CA is located east of the Naval
    Postgraduate School, CA. This is a geographic question that involves determining
    the relative positions of two specific locations. However, the question is ambiguous
    because Tri-Valley University was an unaccredited institution that was shut down
    in 2011, and its status as a legitimate university could be questioned. Additionally,
    the term "east" could be interpreted in various ways, depending on the specific
    points of reference used for each location. Therefore, the question admits more
    than one interpretation, leading to potential different answers.
  - 'The question is asking about the geographical relationship between two specific
    institutions, Tri-Valley University and the Naval Postgraduate School, both located

  - The question asks whether Pfeiffer University in North Carolina is located east
    of Florida National University in Florida. The question is geographically based
    and requires a comparison of the longitudinal positions of the two universities.
    However, the interpretation hinges on understanding "east of" in a longitudinal
    sense, which could lead to confusion if not interpreted geographically. Additionally,
    since both universities are located in the eastern United States, the concept
    of "east" might not be as straightforward. Despite this, the question can be addressed
    with a clear geographical answer by comparing their longitudinal coordinates.
  - The question asks whether Pfeiffer University in North Carolina is located east
    of Florida National University in Florida. The question involves geographical
    locations, and while it might seem straightforward, it is slightly ambiguous due
    to the general phrasing of "east of." In a strict longitudinal sense, it could
    be interpreted as asking whether Pfeiffer University has a greater eastern longitude
    than Florida National University. However, in a broader geographical or directional
    context, it could mean whether it is more "eastern" in terms of US geography,
    which typically refers to the eastern part of the country. Given that North Carolina
    is generally considered to be east of Florida in a broad geographical context,
    but not necessarily by strict longitude, the interpretation could vary. Thus,
    the question allows for different interpretations, leading to potential different
    answers.
  - The question is asking about the geographical location of Pfeiffer University
    in relation to Florida National University. The question is clear because it specifies
