  - 'The question asks whether the F-16 Fighting Falcon made its first flight after
    the Concorde. This question can be clearly interpreted as a comparison of the
    first flight dates of two aircraft: the F-16 Fighting Falcon and the Concorde.
    The first flight of the Concorde was on March 2, 1969, and the first flight of
    the F-16 Fighting Falcon was on February 2, 1974. Since the dates are specific
