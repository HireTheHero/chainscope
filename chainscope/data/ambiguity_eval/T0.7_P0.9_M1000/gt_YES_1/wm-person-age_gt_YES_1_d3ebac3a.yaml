  - The question asks for a comparison of the lifespans of two historical figures,
    Anastasia of Sirmium and William II, Count of Chalon. To determine whether the
    question is clear or ambiguous, we need to consider if there is enough information
    to definitively answer it. Anastasia of Sirmium was a Christian martyr who lived
    in the 3rd century, while William II, Count of Chalon, lived in the 13th century.
    The lifespans of these figures are historical facts that can be researched and
    compared. Therefore, the question is clear in its intention to compare the lengths
    of their lives, assuming historical records provide such information. The question
    does not appear to have multiple interpretations.
  - 'The question asks for a comparison of the lifespans of two historical figures:
    Anastasia of Sirmium and William II, Count of Chalon. To determine whether the
    question is clear or ambiguous, we need to consider the available historical information
    about these figures. Anastasia of Sirmium, who lived in the early Christian period,
    is a saint with a traditionally accepted lifespan, although exact dates can be
    difficult to verify. William II, Count of Chalon, is a later historical figure
    with recorded dates. The question assumes that accurate and comparable data on
    the lifespans of both individuals is available, which may not be the case. Additionally,
    different historical sources might provide varying details about their birth and
    death years, leading to potential ambiguity in determining who lived longer. Therefore,
    the question admits more than one interpretation based on the reliability and
    completeness of historical records.'
  - 'The question asks for a comparison of the lifespans of two historical figures:
    Anastasia of Sirmium and William II, Count of Chalon. However, it does not specify
    which William II, Count of Chalon, is being referred to, as there could potentially
    be multiple historical figures with similar titles. Without further context or
    a specific timeframe, the question could be interpreted in multiple ways. Therefore,
    the question admits more than one interpretation, which could lead to different
    answers depending on which William II, Count of Chalon, is considered.'
  - 'The question asks for a comparison of the lifespans of two historical figures:
    Anastasia of Sirmium and William II, Count of Chalon. To classify this question,
    we need to determine if the information about their lifespans is clear and unambiguous.
    Historical records provide specific birth and death dates for both individuals,
    allowing for a straightforward comparison of their lifespans. Therefore, the question
    admits only one interpretation and can be answered definitively based on historical
    data.'
  - "The question asks for a comparison of the lifespans of two historical figures:\
    \ Anastasia of Sirmium and William II, Count of Chalon. To determine whether the\
    \ question is clear or ambiguous, we need to consider if the lifespans of these\
    \ individuals are well-documented and if there is a single correct answer based\
    \ on historical records. \n\nAnastasia of Sirmium is a Christian martyr from the\
    \ 3rd century, and the exact dates of her birth and death are not precisely known,\
    \ which can make it difficult to determine her exact lifespan. On the other hand,\
    \ William II, Count of Chalon, lived during the 12th and 13th centuries, with\
    \ more concrete historical records available for his lifespan.\n\nGiven the potential\
    \ lack of precise historical data for Anastasia of Sirmium, the question could\
    \ lead to different interpretations based on the available historical evidence\
    \ and assumptions made about her lifespan. This introduces ambiguity into the\
    \ question because the lifespan of Anastasia may not be definitively established,\
    \ making it unclear whether she lived longer than William II, Count of Chalon."
  - The question asks whether Anastasia of Sirmium lived longer than William II, Count
    of Chalon. To answer this question, one would need specific birth and death dates
    for both individuals. However, historical records for these figures might not
    be precise or universally agreed upon, leading to potential variations in the
    interpretation of their lifespans. If there are discrepancies or gaps in historical
    data regarding their birth or death years, this could lead to different conclusions.
    Thus, the question could admit more than one interpretation based on the available
    historical data.
  - The question asks whether Anastasia of Sirmium lived longer than William II, Count
    of Chalon. To determine if this question is clear or ambiguous, we need to assess
    if there is a single interpretation. The question is straightforward in comparing
    the lifespans of two historical figures. Assuming historical records provide definitive
    birth and death dates for both individuals, the question can be answered with
    a clear 'yes' or 'no'. However, if the historical records are incomplete or disputed
    for either or both figures, the question might lead to different interpretations
    based on varying historical sources or opinions. Given the potential for historical
    discrepancies, this question could be considered ambiguous.
  - 'The question asks for a comparison of the lifespans of two historical figures:
    Anastasia of Sirmium and William II, Count of Chalon. The question is clear in
    its request for a comparison of their lifespans, which can be determined by historical
    records. Assuming the dates of birth and death for both figures are known and

    we need to assess whether there is a single interpretation of their lifespans

    period, while William II, Count of Chalon, lived during the medieval period. The
    challenge here is that precise birth and death dates for Anastasia of Sirmium
    may not be well-documented, as often happens with early historical figures. This
    uncertainty in historical records can lead to multiple interpretations regarding
    her lifespan, making it difficult to provide a definitive answer. Therefore, the

    to different figures in Chinese history, or it could be a fictional character.
    Without additional context or specific timeframes, the question admits multiple
    interpretations regarding which individuals are being compared. Therefore, the
    question is ambiguous because it lacks sufficient detail to identify the exact
    historical figures in question, leading to different possible answers based on
    interpretation.
  - The question asks whether Blanche de France lived longer than Princess Yangguo.

    of lifespans, assuming there is historical data available about the birth and

    what it seeks to determine: which of the two lived longer. Therefore, the question
    is clear in its intent.'
  - The question asks whether Antonio Arcioni lived longer than William III de Cantilupe.
    For this question to be clear, both individuals must be well-documented historical
    figures with known birth and death dates, allowing for a straightforward comparison
    of their lifespans. However, if there is insufficient historical information or
    ambiguity about the identity of one or both figures (e.g., multiple individuals
    with the same or similar names), the question becomes ambiguous as it could admit
    multiple interpretations depending on which individuals are being referred to.
  - The question asks whether Antonio Arcioni lived longer than William III de Cantilupe.
    To answer this, we need specific birth and death dates for both individuals. However,
    the question assumes that these historical figures are well-documented and that
    such data is readily available. If either figure is not well-documented, it could
    lead to ambiguity. Additionally, without context, it's unclear if the question
    refers to the same Antonio Arcioni and William III de Cantilupe known historically,
    as there could be multiple individuals with these names. This potential for multiple
    interpretations regarding who these individuals are makes the question ambiguous.
  - The question asks whether Antonio Arcioni lived longer than William III de Cantilupe.
    To answer this, specific birth and death dates for both individuals are needed.
    However, the question does not provide these dates, nor does it clarify if it
    refers to a specific Antonio Arcioni or William III de Cantilupe, as there could
    be multiple historical figures with similar names. This lack of specificity can
    lead to multiple interpretations, as different sources might provide different
    individuals or differing historical records. Therefore, without additional context
    or information, the question is ambiguous.
  - The question asks whether Antonio Arcioni lived longer than William III de Cantilupe.
    To answer this, one would need specific dates of birth and death for both historical
    figures. However, if the dates are not well-documented or if there is uncertainty
    regarding the historical records of either individual, this could lead to different
    interpretations or answers. Additionally, the question does not specify if it
    refers to actual lifespan or recorded lifespan, which could differ due to historical
    inaccuracies.
  - The question asks whether Antonio Arcioni lived longer than William III de Cantilupe.
    For this question to be classified as CLEAR, both individuals must be clearly
    identified historical figures with well-documented birth and death dates, allowing
    for a straightforward comparison of their lifespans. However, if either or both
    individuals are not widely recognized or if their birth and death dates are not
    well-documented, this could lead to ambiguity. Furthermore, if there are multiple
    historical figures with similar names or if there are differing historical records,
    this could also lead to multiple interpretations and answers.
  - 'The question asks whether Antonio Arcioni lived longer than William III de Cantilupe.
    To answer this question, one would need specific birth and death dates for both
    historical figures. However, without additional context or commonly known information
    about these figures, the question is ambiguous because:

    1. There might be multiple historical figures with the same name, leading to different
    interpretations of who Antonio Arcioni or William III de Cantilupe refers to.

    2. The historical record might not have precise or universally agreed-upon birth
    and death dates for these figures, leading to different possible answers depending
    on the sources used.

    Thus, due to the potential for multiple interpretations and the lack of specific,
    universally known information about these figures, the question is classified
    as ambiguous.'
  - The question asks whether Antonio Arcioni lived longer than William III de Cantilupe.
    To answer this, we would need specific birth and death dates for both historical
    figures. However, the question could be considered ambiguous because it assumes
    that the reader has access to these specific dates, which may not be readily available
    or widely known. Furthermore, there might be different historical records or interpretations
    of the lifespans of these figures, leading to multiple possible answers depending
    on the sources consulted.
  - The question asks whether Antonio Arcioni lived longer than William III de Cantilupe.
    This requires specific historical knowledge about the lifespans of both individuals.
    However, the question itself is straightforward and does not have multiple interpretations.
    It simply asks for a comparison between the lifespans of two historical figures.
    The answer depends solely on historical data, which, if available, would provide
    a definitive answer.

    if there is any room for interpretation that could lead to different answers.
    Both individuals are historical figures, and their lifespans can be determined
    from historical records. Therefore, the question has a specific, factual answer
    based on historical data. There is no indication of multiple interpretations or
    unclear terms that could cause ambiguity. The only potential issue could be if
    the historical records themselves are ambiguous or disputed, but the question
    itself is straightforward in its request for a comparison of lifespans.

  - The question asks whether Adalbero von Augsburg lived longer than Otto III von
    Rietberg. To classify this question, we need to consider if there is any ambiguity
    in interpreting the identities of these historical figures or in the parameters
    of the question. Adalbero von Augsburg is typically known as a bishop from the
    10th century, and Otto III von Rietberg is a less commonly known figure, possibly
    leading to uncertainty about which specific individuals the question refers to.
    Additionally, without clear context or specific dates provided, there might be
    ambiguity in determining the lifespan comparison. This can lead to different interpretations
    based on which historical records or sources are referenced, especially if there
    are multiple individuals with similar names from different periods.
  - The question compares the lifespans of two historical figures, Adalbero von Augsburg
    and Otto III von Rietberg. To determine if the question is clear or ambiguous,
    we need to assess whether there is any room for multiple interpretations. Both
    individuals are identified with specific titles and names, which should refer
    to distinct historical figures. However, the potential for ambiguity arises if
    there are multiple historical figures with similar names or if there is uncertainty
    about the exact dates of their births and deaths. If the historical records for
    these figures are precise and well-documented, the question is clear. However,
    if there is any historical ambiguity or lack of consensus about the exact lifespans
    of these figures, the question could be considered ambiguous. Without specific
    knowledge of the historical records in question, it is difficult to definitively
    categorize the question without further context.
  - The question asks whether Adalbero von Augsburg lived longer than Otto III von
    Rietberg. To answer this, one needs specific historical data about the lifespans
    of these two figures. The question does not seem to allow for multiple interpretations
    as it directly compares the lifespans of two specific individuals. Therefore,
    assuming the historical data is available and accurate, the question admits only
    one correct answer based on factual information.
  - The question asks whether Adalbero von Augsburg lived longer than Otto III von
    Rietberg. However, the question is ambiguous due to potential confusion over the
    identity of the historical figures mentioned. Adalbero von Augsburg could refer
    to different individuals throughout history, and Otto III von Rietberg is not
    a widely recognized historical figure, which could lead to multiple interpretations
    of who these individuals are. This ambiguity in identification makes it difficult
    to determine a definitive answer without additional context.
  - The question asks whether Adalbero von Augsburg lived longer than Otto III von
    Rietberg. To determine if this question is clear or ambiguous, we need to consider

    one Otto III von Rietberg, and their birth and death dates are clearly documented
    and undisputed, then the question has only one interpretation and a definitive
    answer. However, if there are multiple historical figures with these names or
    if their lifespans are not clearly documented, the question could be interpreted
    in different ways, leading to ambiguity. Given the specificity of historical figures'
    names, and assuming their historical records are clear, the question can likely

    figures. However, the question does not provide any context or clarification on
    which Friedrich Gren or William II de Cantilupe it refers to, as there might be
    multiple historical figures with similar names. Additionally, without specifying
    the exact individuals, the question could lead to different interpretations based
    on different historical records or assumptions about which persons are intended.
  - The question asks whether Friedrich Gren lived longer than William II de Cantilupe.
    To answer this question, we would need specific birth and death dates for both
    historical figures. However, the question itself is straightforward and does not
    admit multiple interpretations; it is asking for a comparison of lifespan durations.
    Therefore, the question is clear as it requires a factual comparison based on
    historical data.

    \ considering that \u90ED (Guo) and \u4E39 (Dan) are common names. Without additional\
    \ context or specification, it is unclear which \u90ED\u4E39 is being referenced.\
    \ This ambiguity in identifying the correct \u90ED\u4E39 makes the question open\
    \ to multiple interpretations, as different historical figures named \u90ED\u4E39\
    \ could have lived in different eras, leading to different answers regarding their\
    \ longevity compared to Abba Arika. Therefore, due to the potential for multiple\
    \ interpretations regarding the identity of \u90ED\u4E39, the question is classified\

  - "The question asks whether Abba Arika lived longer than \u90ED\u4E39. To classify\
    \ this, we need to determine if the question can be interpreted in more than one\
    \ way. \"Abba Arika\" is a known historical figure, also known as Rav, a Jewish\
    \ Talmudist who lived around 175\u2013247 CE. \"\u90ED\u4E39\" (Guo Dan) could\

    \ context, it is unclear which specific person is being referred to. Due to the\

  - "The question asks whether Abba Arika lived longer than \u90ED\u4E39. To classify\
    \ this, we need to consider potential ambiguities: \n1. The names \"Abba Arika\"\

    \ context or common knowledge, it might be unclear who \"\u90ED\u4E39\" refers\
    \ to, as it could represent different people with similar names across various\
    \ cultures and times. \n2. If \"\u90ED\u4E39\" is a transliteration or translation\
    \ from another language, it might have multiple interpretations or refer to multiple\
    \ figures.\n3. The question assumes knowledge of the lifespan of both individuals,\
    \ which might not be readily available or consistent across different historical\
    \ records.\n\nGiven these points, the question admits more than one interpretation,\

  - "The question asks whether Abba Arika lived longer than \u90ED\u4E39. To answer\
    \ this, one needs to know the lifespans of both individuals. However, the question\
    \ is ambiguous due to several factors: \n1. The name \u90ED\u4E39 could refer\
    \ to different historical figures, as it is a Chinese name and multiple people\
    \ could have had this name throughout history.\n2. Without additional context\
    \ or specific dates for each figure, it is unclear which \u90ED\u4E39 the question\
    \ refers to.\n3. The question assumes the reader knows specific historical details\
    \ about both figures, which may not be common knowledge.\n\nThese ambiguities\
    \ in identifying who \u90ED\u4E39 is, make the question open to multiple interpretations,\
    \ leading to different possible answers depending on which \u90ED\u4E39 is being\
    \ considered."
  - "The question asks whether Abba Arika lived longer than \u90ED\u4E39. This question\
    \ is ambiguous because it relies on identifying who \"\u90ED\u4E39\" is, which\
    \ could refer to different historical figures depending on language or context.\
    \ Without a specific time period or additional identifying information, it's unclear\
    \ which \u90ED\u4E39 is being referred to, making it impossible to determine the\
    \ relative lifespans of the two figures. Furthermore, historical records may not\
    \ provide precise lifespans for either figure, adding another layer of ambiguity."
  - "The question asks whether Abba Arika lived longer than \u90ED\u4E39. This question\
    \ is ambiguous because it requires knowledge of both historical figures and their\

  - "The question involves comparing the lifespans of two historical figures: Abba\
