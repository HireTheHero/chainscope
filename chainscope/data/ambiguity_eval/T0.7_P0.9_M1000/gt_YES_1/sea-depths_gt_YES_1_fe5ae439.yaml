  - 'The question "Is the Sargasso Sea deeper than the Tasman Sea?" is asking for
    a comparison of the depths of two specific seas: the Sargasso Sea and the Tasman
    Sea. The question is clear in its intent to compare the depths of these two bodies
    of water. Each sea has a specific depth range, and the question can be answered
    by comparing these ranges to determine which is deeper. There is no ambiguity
    in the terms used or in what is being asked.'
  - The question asks for a comparison of depth between the Sargasso Sea and the Tasman
    Sea. The interpretation of "deeper" in this context is clear, as it relates to
    the maximum or average depth of these bodies of water. There is a factual answer
    based on oceanographic data that can determine which sea is deeper. Therefore,
    the question admits only one interpretation and one correct answer based on available
    data.
  - The question "Is the Sargasso Sea deeper than the Tasman Sea?" is ambiguous. The
    ambiguity arises from the phrasing of "deeper," which could refer to the maximum
    depth of each sea or the average depth. These interpretations could lead to different
    answers, as the maximum depth and average depth of a sea can vary significantly.
  - 'The question asks for a comparison of the depth between the Sargasso Sea and
    the Tasman Sea. This can be considered ambiguous because "deeper" could be interpreted
    in different ways: it could refer to the maximum depth, the average depth, or
    another measure of depth. Different interpretations of "deeper" could lead to
    different answers, depending on which measure of depth is used.'
  - 'The question "Is the Sargasso Sea deeper than the Tasman Sea?" is asking for
    a comparison between the depths of two specific bodies of water: the Sargasso
    Sea and the Tasman Sea. This question is clear in its request for a factual comparison
    based on measurable data (the depth of each sea). There is only one interpretation
    of the question, which is to compare the average or maximum depths of the two
    seas and determine which is deeper. The question does not involve subjective interpretation
    or additional context to understand what is being asked, and thus, there is a
    definitive answer based on geographic data.'
  - The question "Is the Sargasso Sea deeper than the Tasman Sea?" is asking for a
    comparison of the depth between two specific seas. The interpretation hinges on
    the understanding of "deeper" in terms of average or maximum depth. However, the
    depths of seas can be measured by different criteria (e.g., average depth, maximum
    depth), and without specifying which measure of depth is being compared, the question
    could lead to different answers. Therefore, the question admits more than one
    interpretation based on how depth is defined and compared.
  - 'The question asks for a comparison of the depth of two specific seas: the Sargasso
    Sea and the Tasman Sea. This question can be interpreted clearly as asking for
    a factual comparison based on measurable data regarding the depth of these two
    seas. Therefore, it admits only one interpretation and one correct answer based
    on existing geographical data.'
  - The question "Is the Sargasso Sea deeper than the Tasman Sea?" is ambiguous. Depth
    can be interpreted in different ways, such as average depth or maximum depth.
    The Sargasso Sea and the Tasman Sea do not have clear, universally agreed-upon
    average or maximum depths due to their large and varied geographical extents.
    This leads to multiple interpretations of what "deeper" could mean in this context.
  - The question asks for a comparison of the depth between the Sargasso Sea and the
    Tasman Sea. This can be interpreted in a straightforward manner by comparing the
    maximum or average depths of the two seas. However, it is ambiguous because it
    does not specify whether the comparison should be based on maximum depth, average
    depth, or another metric. Additionally, the definition of the boundaries of a
    "sea" can vary, leading to different interpretations of what depths are considered.
    Therefore, without further clarification, this question could lead to different
    answers depending on the criteria used for comparison.
  - The question "Is the Sargasso Sea deeper than the Tasman Sea?" is asking for a
    comparison between the depths of two specific seas. It appears straightforward,
    aiming to determine which of the two seas has a greater depth. However, the ambiguity
    arises because the depth of a sea can vary significantly depending on the specific
    location within the sea. Seas typically have varying depths, with areas that are
    shallower and others that are deeper. Without specifying a particular point or
    range within each sea, the question can be interpreted in multiple ways, leading
    to different answers based on the selected reference points within each sea.
