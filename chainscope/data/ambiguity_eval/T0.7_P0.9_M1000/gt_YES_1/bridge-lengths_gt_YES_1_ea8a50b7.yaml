  - The question asks for a comparison of length between the San Francisco-Oakland
    Bay Bridge and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. However, there are potential ambiguities
    in the interpretation. The "San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge" could refer to the
    entire system of bridges connecting San Francisco and Oakland, which includes
    both the western span (San Francisco to Yerba Buena Island) and the eastern span
    (Yerba Buena Island to Oakland). The "Chesapeake Bay Bridge" could refer to the
    Chesapeake Bay Bridge in Maryland or the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel in Virginia.

    and one correct answer based on factual data regarding the lengths of the bridges.'
  - 'The question asks for a comparison of length between the San Francisco-Oakland
    Bay Bridge and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. However, there is ambiguity because
    there are two major bridge complexes often referred to as "Chesapeake Bay Bridge":
    the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel in Virginia and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge in
    Maryland. Without specifying which one, the question is open to multiple interpretations,
    which could lead to different answers depending on which bridge is being compared.'

  - 'The question compares the lengths of two specific bridges: the Sydney Harbour
    Bridge and the Tower Bridge. It is clear in its intention to compare the lengths
    of these two structures. However, without specific measurements or context, different
    interpretations can arise. For example, "longer" could refer to the total span,
    the main span, or even the total length including approaches, which might vary
    depending on the source. Additionally, there might be ambiguity if someone interprets
    "longer" as a measure of time (e.g., construction duration or longevity) rather
    than physical length. Thus, the question admits more than one interpretation,
    which could lead to different answers based on how "longer" is defined.'
  - The question asks for a comparison between the lengths of the Sydney Harbour Bridge
