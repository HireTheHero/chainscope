    the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Burlington, VT. The question is
    clear in asking whether Iranistan, CT, is east of the specified cathedral. There
    is only one interpretation of this question, as it involves a straightforward
    geographic comparison based on longitude. Therefore, the question is clear and
    admits only one correct answer based on geographic data.
  - 'The question asks if Iranistan, CT is located east of the Cathedral of the Immaculate
    Conception in Burlington, Vermont. The question is geographically specific, referring
    to two distinct locations: Iranistan, CT (presumably Iranistan Avenue in Bridgeport,
    Connecticut) and the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Burlington, Vermont.
    It seeks a directional relationship (east) between these two locations. This question

  - 'The question is asking for the geographical location of Mineshaft, a gay club,
    in relation to 32 Old Slip, NY. The question assumes that Mineshaft is a specific
    location that can be mapped and compared to another fixed location (32 Old Slip,
    NY). However, there is an ambiguity because "Mineshaft" is not a well-documented
    or universally recognized location, especially if it no longer exists or was never
    widely known. Without clear and verifiable information about Mineshaft''s location,
    there can be multiple interpretations: it might refer to a historical place, a
    fictional location, or simply be an error in naming. This uncertainty about the
    existence and precise location of Mineshaft makes the question ambiguous, as it
    could lead to different answers based on different interpretations of what "Mineshaft"
    refers to.'
  - 'The question asks whether the Mineshaft (a gay club in NY) is located east of
    32 Old Slip, NY. This question is geographically based and relies on the specific
    locations of two points: the Mineshaft and 32 Old Slip. However, there is a potential
    ambiguity because the "Mineshaft" is a historical reference and may no longer
    exist, leading to confusion about which location is being referred to. Additionally,
    there may be ambiguity in determining the precise longitudinal coordinates if
    the exact addresses or locations are not specified. Without additional context
    or information, this question could lead to different interpretations about what
    specific location is being discussed and its current status or historical context.'
  - The question is asking about the relative location of a specific place, Mineshaft
    (gay club), in relation to another specific place, 32 Old Slip, in New York. The
    question seems to assume that Mineshaft (gay club) is a well-known or existing
    location that can be geographically pinpointed. However, there is potential ambiguity
    because "Mineshaft (gay club)" could refer to different places or might not be
    a current or real location at all. If the location of Mineshaft (gay club) is
    not universally recognized or if it does not exist, the question becomes ambiguous
    as it cannot be answered definitively. Furthermore, without specific geographic
    coordinates or a map reference, the interpretation of "east" could also vary slightly,
    though this is a minor point compared to the uncertainty about the location itself.
  - The question is asking for the location of a specific establishment, the Mineshaft
    (gay club), in relation to another specific location, 32 Old Slip, NY. The question
    is straightforward in terms of its spatial relationship query; however, there
    is a potential ambiguity in the identification of the Mineshaft. The Mineshaft
    was a famous gay club in New York City, but it was located in the Meatpacking
    District, which is not near 32 Old Slip. Also, the Mineshaft closed in 1985. Given
    this context, the question assumes the existence of a current or historical place
    and its location, which could lead to confusion. The question is therefore AMBIGUOUS
    because it might refer to historical locations or possibly another place with
    a similar name.
  - 'The question asks about the location of a specific place, Mineshaft (a gay club),
    in relation to another location, 32 Old Slip, NY. To classify this question, we
    need to consider the following:


    1. **Specificity**: The question specifies two locations in New York, indicating
    a need for geographic comparison.

    2. **Geographic Interpretation**: The question''s intent is to determine a geographic
    relationship (east or not east).

    3. **Uniqueness of Locations**: There may be confusion as to whether "Mineshaft
    (gay club), NY" is a currently existing location or a historical one, as well
    as its exact address. If Mineshaft (gay club) is well-documented with a specific
    historical or current address, the question could be clear. However, if there
    are multiple interpretations or records of its location, this could lead to ambiguity.

    4. **Temporal Context**: If the Mineshaft club''s location has changed over time
    or if it no longer exists, this could add another layer of ambiguity.


    Given these considerations, unless there''s a well-known, single historical or
    current address for Mineshaft that doesn''t change over time, the question could
    be interpreted in multiple ways. This makes it potentially ambiguous depending
    on the availability and clarity of information regarding the club''s location.'
  - The question asks about the location of a specific place, Mineshaft (gay club),
    in relation to a specific address, 32 Old Slip, NY. The question is structured
    to seek a geographic comparison, which can be resolved with a map or geographic
    data. There is no ambiguity in the request for geographic directionality (east
    of a specified location). The question does not involve different interpretations
    that would lead to different answers, as it is a straightforward inquiry about
    geographic positioning.
  - 'The question asks whether the Mineshaft, a gay club, is located east of a specific
    address, 32 Old Slip, in New York. The question is straightforward and can be
    interpreted in one way: it requires determining the geographical location of the
    Mineshaft in relation to 32 Old Slip. However, the potential ambiguity arises
    from the fact that the Mineshaft (gay club) is historically known to be in a different
    location (New York City), but it is not a currently operating establishment, as
    it closed in the late 1980s. This historical context might lead to confusion or
    difficulty in providing a current geographic answer. Despite this, the question
    itself is clear in terms of what is being asked (a location comparison), so any
    ambiguity is due to historical context rather than the phrasing of the question
    itself.'
  - The question asks if the Mineshaft (a gay club in NY) is located east of 32 Old
    Slip, NY. However, the Mineshaft is not a known or existing location in New York
    City. The name "Mineshaft" might refer to a club that was famously located in
    the Meatpacking District of New York City but was closed in the 1980s. The ambiguity
    arises from the unclear reference to a potentially non-existent or historical
    location, making it difficult to provide a definitive answer about its geographical
    relation to 32 Old Slip, NY. Without clear information on the current or historical
    existence and location of the Mineshaft relative to 32 Old Slip, the question
    is open to interpretation.
  - The question asks whether the Mineshaft, a gay club, is located east of 32 Old
    Slip, NY. The question seems to rely on specific geographical locations in New
    York. However, there is ambiguity because the Mineshaft was a well-known gay club
    in New York City but was located at a different address, not associated with a
    current or previous location known simply as "Mineshaft." Additionally, the historical
    club was closed in the 1980s, and the name might refer to a different establishment
    or context if mentioned in the present tense. Thus, without further specification
    or clarification of which "Mineshaft" is being referred to, the question could
    be interpreted differently. Furthermore, the phrasing implies a current location
    comparison, which is not possible with a defunct establishment unless a new or
    unrelated location is being implied.
  - The question asks whether a specific location, Mineshaft (a gay club in New York),
    is located east of another specific location, 32 Old Slip, NY. This question seems
    to be looking for a geographical comparison between two specific points. However,
    the ambiguity arises from the fact that "Mineshaft" may refer to different entities
    or locations, and without additional context or a specific address for Mineshaft,
    it's unclear which location is being referenced. Furthermore, if the Mineshaft
    is no longer in operation or has relocated, this could further complicate the
    question. Therefore, due to the potential for multiple interpretations regarding
    what and where "Mineshaft" is, the question is ambiguous.

    to. Moreover, without specific addresses or current existence details, the interpretation
    can vary. Therefore, this question can be interpreted in multiple ways depending
    on which Ziegfeld Theatre is considered and whether historical or current locations
    are taken into account.
  - The question is asking whether the Ziegfeld Theatre, specifically the one from
    1927 in New York, is located east of the New York City Center. This question is
    somewhat ambiguous because the Ziegfeld Theatre that opened in 1927 was located
    at 6th Avenue and 54th Street in Manhattan. However, this theatre was demolished
    in 1966, and a new Ziegfeld Theatre was opened in 1969 at a different location.
    The question does not specify whether it is asking about the original theatre's
    location relative to the New York City Center or the subsequent theatre, leading
    to potential confusion. Furthermore, the phrasing "located east of" could be interpreted

    question regarding the relative positions of two specific locations in New York.
    However, the Ziegfeld Theatre mentioned was demolished in 1966, which could lead
    to confusion about whether the question is referring to the original location
    or a different structure with the same name. Additionally, the phrase "east of"
    is clear in terms of direction, but without specific addresses or understanding
    the context of current vs. historical locations, it could lead to different interpretations.
    Therefore, the question can be interpreted in multiple ways based on these factors.
  - The question asks whether the Ziegfeld Theatre (1927) is located east of New York
    City Center. However, there are multiple interpretations and ambiguities here.
    Firstly, the Ziegfeld Theatre (1927) is no longer in existence, as it was demolished

    and one correct answer based on their geographical coordinates or positions on
    a map.'
  - 'The question asks about the relative locations of two structures: Keller Auditorium
    and Mission Theater and Pub, both presumably located in Oregon (abbreviated as
    "OR"). The phrasing of the question can be interpreted in two ways: it could be
    asking if Keller Auditorium is located east of Mission Theater and Pub, or it
    could be asking if Keller Auditorium is located east of a place called Mission
    Theater and Pub, OR (as if "OR" is part of the name or a different place). The
    use of "OR" after each name makes it unclear whether "OR" is referring to the
    state of Oregon or if it serves a different purpose in the question. Therefore,
    the question admits more than one interpretation, which could lead to different
    answers depending on how the "OR" is interpreted.'

  - 'The question asks if the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Philadelphia,
    PA, is located east of the Forrest Theatre in Philadelphia, PA. The question is
    clear in its request for a geographical relationship between two specific locations
    within the same city. It only admits one interpretation: determining the cardinal
    direction (east) of one landmark relative to another. The question is straightforward
    and does not have multiple interpretations, so it can be answered with a definitive
    yes or no based on geographical data.'
  - The question asks whether the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Philadelphia,
    PA is located east of the Forrest Theatre, PA. The interpretation hinges on the
    locations of these two specific landmarks. However, there is ambiguity in the
    question because there is no well-known Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception
    in Philadelphia. The Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul is the notable Catholic
    cathedral in Philadelphia. This lack of clarity about the exact location of the
    cathedral introduces ambiguity, as there could be multiple interpretations based
    on different assumptions about the location of the cathedral. Additionally, without
    precise geographic coordinates, determining the relative position could lead to
    varying conclusions.
  - 'The question asks about the relative location of two specific structures in Pennsylvania:
    the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Philadelphia and the Forrest Theatre.
    While the question seems straightforward in asking whether one is east of the
    other, there is ambiguity because the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception mentioned
    is not clearly identified as being in Philadelphia, and there is no well-known
    Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Philadelphia, PA. Additionally, the
    Forrest Theatre is known to be in Philadelphia, but without precise coordinates
    or a map reference, determining relative positions based solely on city names
    can be ambiguous. Therefore, the question could be interpreted in different ways
    depending on assumptions made about the locations mentioned.'
  - The question asks whether the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Philadelphia
    is located east of Forrest Theatre in Pennsylvania. The question is specific about
    the two locations and their relative positioning. However, there is a potential

    there might be multiple cathedrals with similar names in the U.S., including in
    Philadelphia. This could lead to ambiguity in determining the exact location of
    the cathedral in question. Without additional context or clarification on which
    "Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception" is being referred to, the question admits
    more than one interpretation. This could lead to different answers depending on
    which cathedral is considered. Therefore, the question is ambiguous due to the
    potential for multiple interpretations of the location being referenced.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative location of two specific structures:

    Conception is not a commonly recognized structure in Philadelphia, and the actual
    name of the cathedral in Philadelphia is the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter
    and Paul. This discrepancy introduces ambiguity because it is unclear if the question
    refers to the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul or another structure.
    Furthermore, without clarification on which structure is being referred to, the
    question admits more than one interpretation, leading to different possible answers
    depending on the assumption made about the identity of the cathedral. Therefore,
