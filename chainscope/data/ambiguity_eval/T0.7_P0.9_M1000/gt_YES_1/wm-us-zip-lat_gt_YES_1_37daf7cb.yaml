    in New Jersey, is located north of another location, identified by the zip code
    44281 in Ohio. The question can be interpreted in only one way: determining the
    geographical latitude of these two specific locations to see if one is indeed
    north of the other. Zip codes are specific and unique identifiers for locations,
    and the concept of "north" in terms of geography is straightforward. Therefore,
    the question has a single interpretation and a single correct answer based on
    geographical data.'
  - The question asks whether the location of the US zip code 07446 in New Jersey
    is north of the zip code 44281 in Ohio. This question is clear in its intent,
    as it seeks to determine the relative geographical positioning of two specific
    locations based on their zip codes. The only interpretation is to check the latitude
    of these locations to see which one is further north. There is one correct answer
    based on geographical data.

    on a map.
  - The question is asking for a geographic comparison between two locations based
    on their ZIP codes, specifically whether one is north of the other. ZIP codes,
    however, do not directly correlate with geographic coordinates, so determining
    the northern location would require additional information about the cities or
    areas associated with these ZIP codes. The question can be interpreted clearly
    as a request for a geographic comparison, but answering it accurately requires
    external data about the locations of these ZIP codes. Therefore, the interpretation
    of the question is clear, but it requires additional information for a precise
    answer.
  - 'The question involves determining the relative geographic locations of two zip
    codes: 07446 in New Jersey and 44281 in Ohio. The query is straightforward as
    it asks if one zip code is located north of the other, which involves comparing

  - The question asks whether the zip code 04062 in Maine (ME) is located north of
    the zip code 04096 in Maine. This question can be considered ambiguous because
    zip codes do not necessarily follow a strict geographical order, especially in
    terms of latitude. Zip codes are primarily designed for mail delivery purposes
    and may not directly correlate to geographical positions such as north or south.
    Therefore, without additional geographical data or context, the question admits
    more than one interpretation regarding the relative locations of these zip codes.
  - The question is asking if one zip code in Maine (04062) is located north of another
    zip code in Maine (04096). However, zip codes do not necessarily follow a strict
    geographical order, and they are not inherently indicative of north-south positioning.
    Therefore, the question may be interpreted in different ways depending on whether
    one assumes zip code numbers correlate with geographic location or not. Without
    additional context or a specific method for determining geographic north-south
    positioning of zip codes, the question can lead to different interpretations and
    answers.
  - The question is asking if one location, identified by the zip code 04062 in Maine,
    is located north of another location, identified by the zip code 04096, also in
    Maine. The question assumes that zip codes can be used to determine geographic
    north-south positioning, which is not always accurate as zip codes are not always
    assigned in a strictly geographic manner. However, the question itself is clear
    in its request for a north-south comparison based on the provided zip codes.
  - The question asks whether the location with the zip code 04062 in Maine is north
    of the location with the zip code 04096 in Maine. The question is AMBIGUOUS because
    zip codes do not necessarily follow a north-to-south geographical order. Zip codes
    are primarily used for postal purposes and are not a reliable indicator of geographical
    north-south positioning. Therefore, without additional geographical data, the
    question admits more than one interpretation and could lead to different answers.
  - The question asks if zip code 04062 in Maine is located north of zip code 04096
    in Maine. Zip codes do not inherently provide geographical location information
    such as latitude or longitude. Therefore, without additional geographical data,
    the question can be interpreted in different ways, as zip codes are not sequentially
    organized by geographic location. This makes the question ambiguous as it assumes
    a geographical relationship based solely on zip codes, which is not accurate.
  - The question is asking whether the location associated with the ZIP code 04062
    in Maine is north of the location associated with the ZIP code 04096 in Maine.
    While ZIP codes are often assigned in a roughly geographic manner, they are not
    strictly linear or geographic. Furthermore, ZIP codes do not inherently convey
    latitude or longitude information, making it difficult to determine geographic
    directionality based solely on the numbers. The question could be interpreted
    in different ways depending on whether one considers ZIP code numbers or actual
    geographic locations. Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation,
    which could lead to different answers depending on the method used to determine
    "northness."
  - The question involves determining the geographic location of two zip codes, 04062
    and 04096, both in Maine, USA. The interpretation relies on understanding the
    relative geographical position of these zip codes. Zip codes do not necessarily
    follow a strict geographical order, so without specific mapping or additional
    information, it is unclear whether 04062 is north of 04096. This lack of inherent
    order in zip codes makes the question ambiguous without further geographical data.
  - 'The question is about determining the relative geographic locations of two US
    zip codes in Maine: 04062 and 04096. However, zip codes are not always assigned
    in a way that reflects geographic order, and without specific latitude and longitude
    data or a map, it''s unclear if one zip code is north of the other. Therefore,
    the question admits more than one interpretation based on how one might assume
    zip codes are organized, which can lead to different answers.'
  - The question is asking whether the location corresponding to the zip code 04062
    in Maine (ME) is north of the location corresponding to the zip code 04096 in
    Maine. The interpretation of this question hinges on the geographical locations
    of these two zip codes. Zip codes do not follow a strict geographical order and
    are not inherently indicative of north-south positioning. However, if one has
    access to a reliable mapping of these zip codes to actual geographical locations,
    the question has a clear answer based on latitude. Therefore, the question has
    only one interpretation and a factual answer based on geographical data.
  - The question is asking whether the location associated with the zip code 04062
    in Maine (ME) is north of the location associated with the zip code 04096 in Maine.
    However, zip codes are not assigned in a strictly geographical north-to-south
    order. Therefore, determining the relative northern position of these zip codes
    based solely on their numbers is not possible without additional geographical
    information. This makes the question ambiguous as it relies on the assumption
    that zip codes can be used to determine north-south positioning, which is not
    necessarily accurate.

  - The question asks whether the location with the zip code 20136 in Virginia is
    north of the location with the zip code 19933 in Delaware. While the question
    is straightforward in terms of asking for a geographical comparison, it is inherently
    ambiguous because zip codes are not strictly geographical and do not necessarily
    follow north-south or east-west patterns. Additionally, the question does not
    specify the criteria for determining the "northern" position, such as whether
    it's based on the center of the zip code area or another point of reference. Therefore,
    the question could be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the criteria used
    to determine north-south positioning.

  - The question asks whether the location corresponding to the ZIP code 15909 in
    Pennsylvania is north of the location corresponding to the ZIP code 15140 in Pennsylvania.
    This question is based on geographical locations and can be answered with map
    data or coordinates. ZIP codes themselves do not inherently indicate geographical
    orientation (north, south, etc.), but they are associated with specific locations
    that can be compared. Therefore, the question has a clear interpretation and a
    specific answer based on geographical data.
  - The question asks whether a specific zip code, 15909, is located north of another
    zip code, 15140, both in Pennsylvania. Zip codes in the United States are not
    strictly geographical; they do not follow a north-to-south or east-to-west progression.
    Therefore, determining whether one zip code is north of another requires additional
    geographical information, such as the latitude of each location. However, without
    such additional information or context, this question can lead to different interpretations
    or assumptions about how zip codes relate to geographic location. Therefore, the
    question is ambiguous because it does not provide sufficient context to determine
    the geographical relationship based solely on the zip codes.
  - The question is asking if one zip code (15909) is located north of another zip
    code (15140) within the state of Pennsylvania. Zip codes do not inherently provide
    geographic orientation or positioning, as they are primarily for postal delivery
    purposes. While they can sometimes follow a general geographic pattern, this is
    not consistent enough to use zip codes alone to determine north-south orientation.
    Without additional geographic data or context, such as a map, the question is
    ambiguous because zip codes alone do not clearly indicate relative geographic
    positions.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographical location of two zip codes

    interpretation of "north" in this context is straightforward as it pertains to
    geographical coordinates. There is one correct answer based on the latitude of
    these zip codes.'
  - The question asks whether the location of the zip code 15909, PA is north of the
    location of zip code 15140, PA. This can be interpreted in terms of geographical
    coordinates, specifically latitude, to determine which zip code is further north.
    Zip codes are specific and have defined geographical locations, so this question
    admits only one interpretation and one correct answer based on geographical data.
  - The question asks if the zip code 15909 is located north of the zip code 15140,
    both in Pennsylvania. This question is asking for a geographical comparison based
    on zip codes, which can be determined using mapping tools or geographical data.
    The interpretation is straightforward as it pertains to the relative north-south
    positioning of two specific locations identified by their zip codes. There is
    only one correct answer based on their geographical locations, making the question
    clear in its intent.
  - The question asks whether one zip code (15909) is located north of another zip
    code (15140) within Pennsylvania. The interpretation of "north" in terms of geographical
    location is straightforward; it refers to the relative position on a map based
    on latitude. Zip codes are well-defined and correspond to specific geographic
    areas, so determining which is further north can be answered by comparing their
    geographical coordinates (latitude). Therefore, the question admits only one interpretation
    and one correct answer based on geographical data.
  - The question asks whether one zip code (15909, PA) is located north of another
    zip code (15140, PA). The question is based on geographical location, which can
    be determined using the coordinates or map data associated with each zip code.
    The interpretation of "north" in this context is straightforward, referring to
    the directional position on a map. Thus, the question admits one interpretation
    and one correct answer based on the geographical data of the zip codes.
  - The question asks if one zip code in Pennsylvania is located north of another
    zip code in the same state. Zip codes are numerical identifiers for postal delivery
    areas and are not inherently geographical indicators. However, the question can
    be interpreted based on geographical locations associated with these zip codes.
    Specifically, 15909 corresponds to Johnstown, PA, and 15140 corresponds to Pitcairn,
    PA. Given these locations, the question can be answered by looking at a map to
    determine their relative positions. Despite the potential need for geographical
    knowledge, the question itself has a single interpretation and can be definitively
    answered based on geographical data.
  - The question asks whether one zip code in Pennsylvania (15909) is located north
    of another zip code (15140). Zip codes are numerical codes used by the postal
    system for mail delivery and do not necessarily correlate to geographical latitude.
    Without additional context or a specific map reference, zip codes alone do not
    provide definitive information on geographic north-south positioning. Therefore,
    the question is ambiguous because it assumes a direct correlation between zip
    code numbers and geographic locations, which is not inherently accurate.

    of the two given zip codes. Therefore, it admits one correct answer based on geographic
    data.'
  - The question is asking about the geographical location of two zip codes in Michigan
    (MI) and whether one is north of the other. The interpretation of the question
    is straightforward as it seeks to determine the relative north-south position
    of these two specific zip codes. There is only one correct interpretation and
    answer based on geographical data regarding the locations of these zip codes.
  - The question asks whether the location of one zip code in Michigan (48127) is
    north of another zip code (48210). Zip codes are not arranged in a strictly geographical
    order, so the numbers themselves do not provide enough information to determine
    the geographical location in relation to each other. Additionally, without more
    specific information about the geographical locations associated with these zip
    codes, the question can be interpreted in different ways, potentially leading
    to different answers. Therefore, the question is ambiguous because it relies on
    assumptions about the ordering of zip codes that are not universally applicable.
  - The question asks whether the location with the zip code 48127 is north of the
    location with the zip code 48210. While the question appears straightforward,
    it is based on the assumption that zip codes are organized in a way that reflects
    geographical positioning, specifically latitude. However, zip codes are not assigned
    strictly based on geographic location; they are primarily for postal delivery
    purposes and can be non-sequential in terms of geography. Thus, the question could
    be interpreted in terms of geographic latitude or simply based on the numeric
    sequence of the zip codes. This leads to potential ambiguity, as the numeric sequence
    does not reliably indicate geographic positioning.
  - 'The question asks if the location of ZIP code 48127 in Michigan is north of ZIP
    code 48210 in Michigan. The interpretation is straightforward: it is asking for
    a geographical comparison between two specific ZIP codes based on their latitude.
    ZIP codes are specific and have definitive geographical locations, which can be
    determined using a map or geographic data. Therefore, the question admits only
    one interpretation, which is to find the relative geographical position of the
    two ZIP codes.'
  - The question asks if zip code 48127 in Michigan is located north of zip code 48210
    in Michigan. While zip codes are often assigned in a geographical order, they
    are not strictly linear nor do they follow precise geographical boundaries. Therefore,
    determining the relative north-south position based solely on zip codes can be
    misleading without a map or additional geographical context. This makes the interpretation
    of the question dependent on external geographical data to determine if one zip
    code is indeed north of the other. Hence, the question can admit different interpretations
    based on available data and assumptions about zip code ordering.
  - The question asks whether one zip code (48127, MI) is located north of another
    zip code (48210, MI). While zip codes generally follow a numerical order, they
    are not necessarily arranged geographically in a strict north-south or east-west
    pattern. Without additional geographic data, the question could be interpreted
    in different ways depending on how one interprets the relationship between zip
    code numbers and geographic locations. Therefore, this question admits more than
    one interpretation and could lead to different answers based on different assumptions
    about how zip codes are organized geographically.
  - The question asks whether one zip code area (48127) is located north of another
    (48210) in Michigan. Zip codes are numerical codes assigned to specific geographic
    areas for postal purposes, but they do not necessarily follow a strict geographical
    order or pattern. Therefore, determining the northern location based solely on
    zip code numbers can be misleading. The question does not specify how to interpret
    the zip codes geographically, such as by using latitude or other mapping data.
    Consequently, the question admits more than one interpretation, as it can be understood
    as asking about numerical order or actual geographic location based on mapping
    data.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 48127 in Michigan is located north of the
    zip code 48210 in Michigan. This question could be considered ambiguous because
    zip codes do not necessarily follow a linear geographical order, and without specific
    geographical coordinates or a map, the determination of "north" is not straightforward.
    Additionally, the question does not specify the criteria or methods by which "north"
    should be determined (e.g., based on the geographic center of the zip code area,
    the northernmost point, etc.). Therefore, multiple interpretations could arise
    based on different methods of assessing location.
  - The question is asking if one location (48127, MI) is north of another location
    (48210, MI) based on their zip codes. This seems like a straightforward geographical
    question. However, zip codes are not strictly geographic and do not always correspond
    to a logical north-south or east-west order. Therefore, interpreting zip codes
    as a means to determine geographical direction can be misleading. To accurately
    answer the question, one would need to look up the actual geographic coordinates
    or locations of these zip codes, which means the question does not have a single
    clear interpretation based solely on the information given.

  - The question asks whether the zip code 19134 in Pennsylvania is located north
    of the zip code 19131 in Pennsylvania. Zip codes are typically assigned based
    on population and delivery routes, and not strictly based on geographical coordinates.
    Therefore, knowing the relative position of these zip codes requires specific
    geographical knowledge or mapping, which does not inherently lead to multiple
    interpretations. The question is specific about the two zip codes and their relative
    north-south position, which admits one correct answer based on geographical data.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographic location of two zip codes
    in Pennsylvania: 19134 and 19131. The interpretation here is straightforward as
    it pertains to the geographical north-south positioning of these specific zip
    codes. Zip codes are specific numeric identifiers for areas, and there is a clear
    and factual answer regarding which one is located north of the other based on
    their geographic coordinates. Therefore, the question does not admit multiple
    interpretations.'
  - The question asks whether one specific zip code (19134, PA) is located north of
    another (19131, PA). While zip codes can be geographically analyzed, they are
    not strictly organized in a north-south or east-west manner. The location of zip
    codes is determined by the postal service for logistical purposes, not strictly
    by latitude or longitude. Thus, determining which zip code is north of the other
    based solely on the zip code number can be ambiguous. Additionally, without a
    map or specific knowledge of these zip codes' locations, it can lead to different
    interpretations or require external data to answer definitively.

    and one correct answer based on geographic data.
  - The question asks whether the location associated with the zip code 19134 in Pennsylvania
    is north of the location associated with the zip code 19131 in Pennsylvania. Zip
    codes are used for mail delivery and are not always arranged in a strictly geographic
    manner. Therefore, determining whether one zip code is north of another requires
    additional geographic information. The question is clear in its intent and requires
    a factual geographic determination based on the locations of the two zip codes.
    There is no ambiguity in the interpretation of the question itself.
  - 'The question asks about the relative geographic location of two specific zip
    codes within Pennsylvania: 19134 and 19131. Zip codes are numerical and do not
    inherently imply geographical directionality (north, south, east, west). Therefore,
    determining whether one zip code is north of another requires external geographic
    knowledge of the actual locations these zip codes correspond to. However, the
    question is straightforward in what it is asking: a comparison of the northern
    position between two specific locations. There is no ambiguity in the interpretation
    of the question itself; it is a request for factual geographic information.'
  - The question asks whether the zip code 19134 in Pennsylvania is located north
    of the zip code 19131 in Pennsylvania. Zip codes are not inherently geographical
    indicators of direction, as they are primarily used for postal service purposes.
    While zip codes can sometimes provide a rough approximation of location, the question
    assumes a geographical relationship between them, which may not be accurate. Therefore,
    the question is ambiguous because it relies on an assumption about the geographical
    ordering of zip codes, which may not hold true in all cases.
  - The question is asking whether the location associated with the zip code 19134
    in Pennsylvania is north of the location associated with the zip code 19131 in
    Pennsylvania. This is a straightforward geographical question that can be answered
    by checking the relative positions of these two zip codes on a map. There is only
    one interpretation of the question, which is determining the north-south relationship
    between the two specific zip codes. Therefore, the question is clear and admits
    only one correct answer based on geographical data.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative location of two specific ZIP codes
    in Pennsylvania: 19134 and 19131. ZIP codes generally follow a geographic pattern,
    but they are not strictly linear or sequential in a north-south orientation. The
    question could be interpreted as asking about the general direction based on ZIP
    code numbers, which is not necessarily accurate geographically. Additionally,
    ZIP codes can cover irregularly shaped areas. Therefore, without additional context
    or geographic data, the question could lead to different interpretations about
    what "north of" means in this context.'
  - The question is asking whether the zip code 19134, PA is located north of the
    zip code 19131, PA. This question is geographically based and can be interpreted
    as a straightforward inquiry about the relative north-south positioning of two
    specific zip codes. Given that zip codes are fixed geographical locations, there

  - The question asks whether the location of one zip code (40211, KY) is north of
    another zip code (40601, KY). This question might seem straightforward at first,
    but it is actually ambiguous because zip codes are not strictly geographical indicators.
    They are primarily used for postal delivery and do not follow a north-to-south
    or east-to-west order. Therefore, without additional geographical data or context,
    such as latitude and longitude, the question cannot be definitively answered based
    solely on zip codes. The interpretation of the question could vary depending on
    how one chooses to approach the concept of "north," leading to different answers.
    Hence, the question is open to multiple interpretations.
  - "The question is asking whether one zip code (40211, KY) is located north of another\
    \ zip code (40601, KY). Zip codes are primarily used for mail delivery and do\
    \ not necessarily align with geographical directions. Therefore, the question\
    \ could be interpreted in different ways: \n1. It could be asking if the numerical\
    \ value of the zip code 40211 is less than 40601, which might suggest a northern\
    \ location if zip codes were assigned geographically in a north-to-south manner,\
    \ which is not the case.\n2. It could be asking for the actual geographic location\
    \ of these zip codes within Kentucky, which would require specific geographic\
    \ knowledge or a map to determine the relative positions.\n\nBecause zip codes\
    \ do not follow a strict geographic pattern, determining which zip code is north\
    \ of the other requires additional geographic context beyond the numbers themselves.\
    \ Thus, the question is open to interpretation and depends on how one chooses\
    \ to resolve the location aspect."
  - The question asks if the location associated with the zip code 40211 in Kentucky
    is north of the location associated with the zip code 40601 in Kentucky. The question
    relies on the interpretation of zip codes as geographical indicators. However,
    zip codes are primarily used for postal purposes and do not necessarily follow
    a geographic order. Therefore, the question could be interpreted as asking about
    the relative geographical positions based on zip codes, which is not a reliable
    method for determining geographic locations. Additionally, zip codes do not inherently
    convey latitude or north-south positions. Thus, the question admits more than
    one interpretation, as one might consider geographic coordinates or simply the
    numeric order of the zip codes, leading to potentially different answers.
  - 'The question asks if one specific ZIP code (40211, KY) is located north of another
    ZIP code (40601, KY). The query seems to rely on the geographical positioning
    of the ZIP codes based on their numbers. However, ZIP codes are not necessarily
    assigned in a geographical order, and the number itself doesn''t directly indicate
    a geographical direction such as north or south. Additionally, the question could
    be interpreted as asking about latitude comparison, which is not directly related
    to ZIP code numbers. Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation:
    either as a question about ZIP code numbering or as a geographical location comparison
    based on latitude.'
  - The question is asking whether the location of a specific zip code (40211, KY)
    is north of another zip code (40601, KY). However, zip codes do not inherently
    provide geographical direction or location, as they are primarily used for mail
    delivery purposes and do not always follow a logical geographical order. Without
    additional geographical information, such as latitude and longitude or a map,
    it is unclear how to determine the relative north-south position of these zip
    codes. Therefore, the question could be interpreted as asking about geographical
    location or simply about zip code numbers, leading to different interpretations.
  - 'The question involves comparing the geographical locations of two zip codes in
    Kentucky: 40211 and 40601. The question asks if one zip code area is located north
    of the other. Since zip codes are not strictly geographic indicators and do not
    follow a linear north-south pattern, they cannot be used to accurately determine
    relative geographic positions without additional context or a map. Thus, the interpretation
    of the question relies on the assumption that zip codes can be directly compared
    in terms of north-south orientation, which is not necessarily valid. This leads
    to ambiguity because zip codes are more about mail delivery routes and not geographic
    coordinates.'
  - The question asks if the location of the zip code 40211 in Kentucky is north of
    the location of zip code 40601 in Kentucky. This is a clear geographical question
    that involves determining the relative positions of two specific zip code areas
    within the state of Kentucky. There is only one interpretation, which is to compare
    the geographical latitude of the two zip codes to see if one is north of the other.
  - The question asks if the location of zip code 40211 is north of zip code 40601,
    both presumably in Kentucky. The question assumes that zip codes correspond to
    geographic locations that can be directly compared in terms of latitude. However,
    zip codes are primarily for postal purposes and don't always follow a strict geographic
    order, meaning that higher or lower numbers do not necessarily correlate with
    latitude. Therefore, the question is ambiguous because it relies on an incorrect
    assumption about zip code sequencing and geographic location.
  - The question asks whether the location of the zip code 40211 in Kentucky is north
    of the location of the zip code 40601 in Kentucky. This requires geographical
    knowledge or access to a map to determine the relative positions of these two
    zip codes. The question is specific and does not admit multiple interpretations;
    it asks for a straightforward geographical comparison based on latitude.
  - The question involves determining the relative geographical locations of two zip
    codes within Kentucky, 40211 and 40601. While the question appears straightforward,
    it actually admits some ambiguity. The zip code 40211 is primarily associated
    with Louisville, KY, and 40601 with Frankfort, KY. Determining if one is north
    of the other can depend on specific parts of these areas due to their spread and
    the way zip codes are distributed. Without specifying the exact point of comparison
    within the zip codes, the question could lead to different answers based on interpretation.
    Additionally, zip codes do not necessarily follow a strict north-south order,
    adding to the potential ambiguity.

    (19444, PA). The interpretation of "north" in terms of geography is clear: it
    refers to a location being at a higher latitude. However, the question could be
    seen as ambiguous due to the lack of specific geographical data in the question
    itself, such as latitude coordinates or city names, which are necessary to determine
    the relative positions accurately. Additionally, the question assumes knowledge
    of U.S. geography and zip code locations, which may not be universally known.
    Without this specific data, the question could lead to different interpretations
    or require external research to confirm. Thus, it is not entirely straightforward
    based solely on the information provided.'
  - The question is asking whether the location associated with the zip code 43912
    in Ohio is north of the location associated with the zip code 19444 in Pennsylvania.
    This question is clear and specific, as zip codes correspond to specific geographic
    areas, and the relative north-south positioning of these areas can be determined
    using geographic coordinates. Therefore, the question admits only one interpretation
    and one correct answer based on geographic data.
  - The question asks whether the location with the zip code 43912 in Ohio is north
    of the location with the zip code 19444 in Pennsylvania. Zip codes are specific
    to certain geographic areas, and their relative positions can be determined using
    geographical data. Therefore, the question can be answered with a definitive yes
    or no based on the geographical coordinates of the zip codes. The question does
    not admit multiple interpretations, as it is clear about what is being asked and
    can be answered with specific geographic information.
  - The question is asking whether one specific location (43912, OH) is north of another
    location (19444, PA). The question seems to be based on geographical positioning,
    which is a straightforward factual inquiry. However, the ambiguity arises from
    the nature of zip codes, which can cover areas rather than pinpoint specific locations,
    and the fact that zip code boundaries do not necessarily align with precise geographic
    points. Additionally, the question does not specify whether it is asking about
    the northernmost point, the center, or another reference point of the zip code
    areas. Therefore, depending on the interpretation of how the zip codes are represented
    geographically, the answer could vary.
  - 'The question is asking whether one location (identified by the zip code 43912
    in Ohio) is located north of another location (identified by the zip code 19444
    in Pennsylvania). This question involves a geographical determination based on
    latitude, which can be objectively determined. There is no ambiguity in the question
    as it has a clear, singular interpretation: it is asking for a comparison of the
    geographical positions of two specific zip codes. Therefore, it admits only one
    correct answer based on the relative latitudinal positions of these two locations.'
  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographic location of two zip codes:
    43912 in Ohio and 19444 in Pennsylvania. It is clear that the question is seeking
    to determine which zip code is further north. However, the interpretation of "north"
    could be based on different factors such as the latitude of the geographic center
    of each zip code area or the northernmost point within each zip code boundary.
    Despite this, typically, such a question would be interpreted as comparing the
    latitude of the central point of each zip code, which provides a single, straightforward
    interpretation and answer. Therefore, the question is clear in its intent to compare
    the latitudes of the two zip codes.'
  - The question is asking whether one location (43912, OH) is north of another location

    of the question, which is to determine the relative north-south position of the
    two zip codes based on their geographical coordinates.
  - 'The question asks whether the location associated with one US zip code is north
    of the location associated with another US zip code. However, zip codes do not
    directly correspond to geographic latitude, as they are primarily used for postal
    routing and can be non-sequential in terms of geography. Therefore, determining
    "north" based on zip codes alone can be ambiguous without additional geographic
    information. Thus, the question could be interpreted in multiple ways: either
    by considering the actual geographic locations of the areas associated with these
    zip codes or by mistakenly trying to infer geographic direction from the numerical
    order of the zip codes.'
  - 'The question asks whether the location of the zip code 43912 in Ohio is north

  - The question is asking whether the location of the zip code 77061 in Texas is
    north of the location of the zip code 77031 in Texas. While zip codes do have
    specific geographic boundaries, the question could be interpreted in multiple
    ways. One interpretation could involve considering the geographic centers of the
    zip codes, while another could consider the entire area covered by the zip codes.
    Additionally, without precise geographic information or a map, the question does
    not provide enough context to definitively answer whether one zip code is north
    of the other based solely on their numerical values. Therefore, the question can
    lead to different answers depending on the method used to interpret the location
    of the zip codes.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 77061 in Texas is located north of the

  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographical location of two specific
    ZIP codes in Texas: 77061 and 77031. ZIP codes are generally organized by postal
    routes rather than geographical orientation, which means their numerical order
    does not necessarily correspond to north-south positioning. However, the question
    is clear in its intent to find out if one ZIP code is geographically north of
    the other, which can be verified with a map or geographical data. There is only
    one interpretation here: determining the north-south relationship between the
    two specific ZIP codes. Thus, the question is straightforward and admits one correct
    answer based on geographical data.'
  - The question asks whether the zip code 77061 in Texas is located north of the
    zip code 77031 in Texas. The question assumes that zip codes can be directly compared
    geographically based solely on their numerical values, which is not necessarily
    accurate, as zip codes are not assigned in a strictly north-to-south manner. Therefore,
    the interpretation of the question can vary depending on whether one assumes a
    direct numerical comparison or if one uses a geographic map to determine the relative
    locations of the zip codes. This leads to potential ambiguity in how the question
    can be answered.

  - The question asks whether one zip code in Texas (77061) is located north of another
    zip code (77031). While zip codes often follow a certain geographical order, they
    are not strictly arranged in a north-south manner. Additionally, without specific
    geographic knowledge or a map, it is not possible to definitively determine the
    relative north-south position of these zip codes based solely on the numbers.
    Furthermore, zip codes can encompass irregularly shaped areas, adding to the complexity.
    Therefore, the question could be interpreted as asking for a geographical comparison
    or a numerical one, leading to different methodologies and potentially different
    answers.
  - The question is asking about the relative location of two zip codes, 77061 and
    77031, in Texas. While it might seem straightforward, the question is actually
    ambiguous because zip codes do not necessarily follow a strict geographical order.
    They are primarily used for mail delivery routes rather than geographic boundaries.
    Therefore, without specific geographical data or maps, determining the relative
    north-south position of two zip codes based solely on their numbers is not possible.
    Additionally, without more context or information about the specific locations
    within the zip codes, this question can be interpreted in multiple ways regarding
    what "located north" means in this context.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographical location of two specific
    ZIP codes in Texas: 77061 and 77031. The question is clear in its intent, which
    is to determine whether ZIP code 77061 is geographically north of ZIP code 77031.
    ZIP codes are numerical and can be mapped to specific geographic locations, allowing
    for a straightforward comparison of their positions. Therefore, this question
    has one interpretation and can be answered definitively by examining a map or
    database of ZIP code locations.'

    asking for a geographical comparison between two specific zip codes. Given that
    zip codes can be mapped to specific locations, there is a definitive answer to
    whether one is north of the other based on their geographic coordinates.
  - The question is asking whether one zip code in Texas is located north of another
    zip code in Texas. However, zip codes are not inherently geographical indicators
    of north or south, as they do not follow a strict geographical order. Without
    additional context or a geographical map, determining the relative north-south
    position of these zip codes based solely on their numerical order is ambiguous.
    Therefore, the question could lead to different interpretations or answers depending
    on the method used to determine the location (e.g., using a map or a database
    lookup). This makes the question ambiguous.

  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographic location of two zip codes
    in Kentucky: 40517 and 40514. The question seems straightforward at first, as
    it asks whether one zip code is north of the other. However, zip codes do not
    always follow a strictly geographic order, and they can sometimes be non-contiguous
    or arranged in a manner that does not correspond to simple cardinal directions.
    Additionally, the question does not specify the criteria for determining "north"
    (e.g., based on the centroid of the zip code area, a specific point within each
    zip code, etc.). Therefore, there could be multiple interpretations of how to
    determine which zip code is "north" of the other, leading to different answers
    depending on the method used. This makes the question ambiguous.'
  - The question asks whether a specific zip code (40517, KY) is located north of
    another zip code (40514, KY). The interpretation hinges on understanding the geographical
    locations of these zip codes. Zip codes are not necessarily ordered by geographical
    direction, so the numbers do not inherently provide information about their relative
    positions. To answer the question, one would need additional geographical data
    or a map to determine the relative positions of these zip codes. However, the
    question itself is clear in asking for a comparison of locations based on a north-south
    orientation, assuming a geographical context. Thus, there is only one interpretation,
    which is to ascertain the north-south relationship between the two zip codes.
  - The question is asking whether one ZIP code, 40517, is located north of another
    ZIP code, 40514, both of which are in Kentucky. ZIP codes are not inherently geographical
    indicators of north-south location, as they are primarily used for postal routes
    and do not necessarily follow geographical lines. Consequently, the question is
    ambiguous because ZIP codes alone do not provide enough information to determine
    geographical directionality without additional context, such as actual geographical
    coordinates or a map.
  - This question is AMBIGUOUS because it assumes a direct correlation between ZIP
    code numbers and geographical location, which is not necessarily the case. ZIP
    codes are not assigned in a strictly geographical manner that would make a higher
    or lower number consistently north or south of another. Therefore, the question
    could lead to different interpretations about what is being asked and cannot be
    definitively answered based solely on the ZIP code numbers.
  - The question asks if the location associated with the ZIP code 40517 is north
    of the location associated with the ZIP code 40514, both of which are in Kentucky.
    This question assumes that ZIP codes are arranged in a geographic manner where
    higher or lower numbers correlate with specific directional locations, which is
    not necessarily the case. ZIP codes are primarily used for mail delivery and do
    not strictly follow geographic or directional patterns. Without specific geographic
    information about the two ZIP codes, the question can lead to different interpretations
    about their relative locations. Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation
    regarding the relationship between the two ZIP codes based solely on their numbers.
  - The question asks about the relative location of two zip codes in Kentucky, 40517
    and 40514. This question could be interpreted in terms of geographic location
    based on the zip code numbers, but zip codes are not necessarily assigned in a
    strictly geographical order, especially concerning north-south orientation. Therefore,
    determining whether one zip code is north of another based solely on the zip code
    numbers may not yield a definitive answer without additional geographic data.
    This introduces ambiguity as the question does not specify how the determination
    should be made (e.g., by zip code numbering or actual geographic coordinates).
  - The question asks whether the location of the zip code 40517 in Kentucky is north
    of the location of the zip code 40514 in Kentucky. The question is specific and
    straightforward, as zip codes have fixed geographical locations. There is only
    one interpretation, which involves comparing the geographical positions of the

    Lexington, Kentucky, and their relative positions can be accurately identified
    using a map. Therefore, the question has one clear interpretation and can be answered
    definitively with geographical data.
  - 'The question asks about the relative location of two zip codes in Kentucky: 40517
    and 40514. Zip codes are generally numeric and sequential, but they do not always
    follow a strict geographic order. Therefore, determining if one zip code is north
    of another based solely on the zip code numbers can be misleading. The question
    assumes a geographic relationship based on zip codes, which can vary and is not
    explicitly defined. Without additional geographic data, the interpretation of
    "north" is unclear, leading to multiple potential answers depending on the geographic
    information available. This makes the question ambiguous.'

    of the location of zip code 40514 in Kentucky. This is a geographical question
    that has a definitive answer based on the actual locations of these zip codes.
    It does not admit multiple interpretations, as it is asking for a specific directional
    relationship between two fixed points.

  - The question is asking whether a specific location in Missouri (MO) with the ZIP
    code 65810 is located north of a specific location in Virginia (VA) with the ZIP
    code 23602. However, ZIP codes do not provide direct geographical information
    about latitude or the relative north-south position between locations, as they
    are primarily used for postal delivery purposes. Moreover, the ZIP code 65810
    is actually located in Springfield, Missouri, and the ZIP code 23602 is in Newport
    News, Virginia. Given these specific locations, the question is clear and can
    be answered based on geographical knowledge. Springfield, MO is indeed north of

  - The question asks whether a location with the zip code 65810, presumably in Missouri
    (MO), is located north of a location with the zip code 23602, presumably in Virginia
    (VA). However, the question contains ambiguity because zip codes do not inherently
    provide geographical direction or specific latitude information. Additionally,
    the question makes an assumption by associating zip codes directly with states,
    which might not always be the case due to how zip codes and state lines work.
    Furthermore, the question does not specify whether it is asking about the northernmost
    point of each zip code or some other reference point. Thus, there are multiple
    interpretations and potential answers depending on how the zip code boundaries
    and geographical references are understood.
  - 'The question is asking if the zip code 65810, which is in Missouri (MO), is located
    north of the zip code 23602, which is in Virginia (VA). The question seems clear
    because it is asking for a geographical comparison based on latitude, which can
    be objectively determined. However, there is an issue: 65810 is actually a zip
    code in Springfield, Missouri, while 23602 is in Newport News, Virginia. The question
    contains a factual error regarding the state for 65810, which could lead to confusion
    about the intent. Despite this error, if we assume the zip codes provided are
    correct, then the question is asking a clear geographical question. Thus, the
    question admits one interpretation: comparing the latitudinal positions of two
    zip codes. Given this, the question is relatively straightforward in terms of
    what is being asked.'
  - The question asks if the zip code 65810, which is associated with Springfield,
    Missouri (MO), is located north of the zip code 23602, which is associated with
    Newport News, Virginia (VA). The question is clear in its geographical nature,
    asking for a relative north-south positioning of two specific locations based
    on their zip codes. The interpretation of "north" is straightforward in the context
    of geographical location. Therefore, the question admits only one interpretation
    and one correct answer based on geographical data.
  - 'The question asks whether a location identified by a zip code in Missouri (65810)

    65810 is actually in Springfield, Missouri, and the zip code 23602 is in Newport
    News, Virginia. Given that zip codes are specific to certain geographic locations,
    the question is essentially asking for a geographic comparison based on latitude.
    There is only one way to interpret the question: determining the relative north-south
    position of these two specific locations based on their known geographic coordinates.
    Therefore, the question admits only one interpretation and one correct answer.'
  - The question asks about the relative geographic location of two zip codes, 65810
    and 23602. The question assumes that zip codes inherently indicate geographic
    positioning north or south, which is not accurate. Zip codes are primarily used
    for postal purposes and do not necessarily correspond to latitude. Additionally,
    the question incorrectly associates zip code 65810 with the state of Missouri
    (MO) when it is actually in Springfield, Missouri, and 23602 is in Newport News,
    Virginia. The ambiguity arises from the incorrect association of zip codes with
    geographic positions and the misidentification of state locations. This makes
    the question ambiguous as it can lead to different interpretations based on the
    misunderstanding of zip code geography and state locations.
  - 'The question involves determining the relative geographical locations of two
    places based on their zip codes: 65810, MO and 23602, VA. The question can be
    interpreted as asking if the location in Missouri (MO) with the zip code 65810
    is north of the location in Virginia (VA) with the zip code 23602. However, zip
    codes do not inherently provide information about latitude or geographical position,
    and they do not always correspond directly to specific cities or areas in a way
    that allows for straightforward north-south comparisons. Therefore, the question
    requires external information about the actual locations these zip codes represent,
    which could lead to different interpretations or methods of determining "north."
    Additionally, the mention of "MO" (Missouri) might be a mistake since 65810 is
    a zip code for Springfield, MO, which is indeed in Missouri, but this adds another
    layer of potential confusion if the intent was to refer to a different state or
    location. Overall, the ambiguity arises from the reliance on zip codes for geographical
    positioning and the potential for misinterpretation of the state abbreviations.'

  - The question asks whether the location with the zip code 62269 in Illinois is
    situated north of the location with the zip code 62208 in Illinois. Zip codes
    do not inherently provide geographical directionality or precise latitude information,
    so while they can sometimes suggest relative location, they do not consistently
    indicate north-south relationships. Without additional context or geographical
    data, the question could be interpreted in multiple ways regarding the criteria
    used to determine "north of." Therefore, the question is ambiguous as it requires
    more specific information or assumptions about how zip codes relate to geographical

  - The question is asking about the geographical location of two specific zip codes
    in Illinois, 62269 and 62208, in relation to each other. The question is clear
    in its request for a comparison of their north-south positioning. However, without
    a map or additional context, one might not know the exact locations or the relative
    positioning of these zip codes, but the question itself is straightforward and
    has a definitive answer based on geographical data.
  - The question asks whether one US zip code (62269, IL) is located north of another
    zip code (62208, IL). This question can be considered AMBIGUOUS because zip codes
    do not inherently contain geographical information about north-south positioning.
    They are primarily used for postal delivery and do not necessarily follow geographical
    lines or directions. Therefore, without additional geographical data or context
    about the specific locations of these zip codes, there is no straightforward answer
    based solely on the zip codes themselves.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographical location of two specific
    zip codes in Illinois: 62269 and 62208. The interpretation here is straightforward,

  - The question is asking whether one zip code (62269) is located north of another
    zip code (62208) in the state of Illinois. Zip codes are numerical postal codes
    used to identify specific geographic areas, but they do not inherently provide
    information about geographic direction or relative location. Therefore, the question
    requires external geographical knowledge or a map to determine the relative north-south
    position of these zip codes. However, the question itself is straightforward and
    does not admit multiple interpretations; it simply requires a factual determination
    of the relative positions of the two zip codes. Therefore, it is not ambiguous
    in terms of understanding what is being asked.
  - The question asks whether one zip code area (62269, IL) is located north of another
    zip code area (62208, IL). Zip codes do not inherently provide geographical location
    information such as cardinal directions (north, south, etc.), as they are primarily
    for postal delivery purposes. While it is possible to determine the general location
    of each zip code using maps or geographic data, the question is straightforward
    in its request for a geographical comparison. However, without specific data or
    maps, the answer could vary depending on the interpretation of the "location"
    (e.g., based on the center of the zip code area, postal office location, etc.).
    Therefore, the question could be interpreted differently depending on how one
    chooses to define "location" within a zip code area.
  - 'The question asks whether one zip code (62269) is located north of another zip
    code (62208) in Illinois. This requires determining the geographical location
    of these zip codes. Zip codes are numeric codes that correspond to specific areas,
    but they do not inherently contain directional information like latitude or longitude.
    Thus, the question has only one interpretation: determining the relative north-south
    position of two fixed locations based on their zip codes. The answer would involve
    checking a map or a database to see which zip code is geographically north of
    the other. As there is only one interpretation and one correct answer based on

    to the east and north of Michigan, which makes the question clear in terms of
    geographic interpretation. However, zip codes do not correspond directly to geographic
    coordinates, and a precise answer would require additional geographic data to
    determine the relative positions accurately. While the intention is clear, the
    use of zip codes without specific latitude and longitude information might lead
    to different interpretations about what is being compared. Nevertheless, the question
    itself remains a straightforward request for a geographic comparison.

  - The question asks whether the location corresponding to the zip code 10451 in
    New York is north of the location corresponding to the zip code 07927 in New Jersey.
    While the question could be interpreted as a straightforward geographical query,
    the potential ambiguity arises from the lack of explicit reference to specific
    geographical points or methods for determining "north" (e.g., comparing latitudes
    of central points of zip codes, city boundaries, etc.). However, given that zip
    codes are a widely recognized system and typically associated with specific areas,
    the question leans more towards a geographical comparison based on conventional
    understanding of zip code locations. Thus, the interpretation is more likely to

    inherently geographic indicators of latitude, as they are primarily used for postal
    delivery routes. Thus, determining if one zip code is north of another based solely
    on the zip code numbers is not straightforward and can be misleading. Additionally,
    without further context or geographic data, the question is open to interpretation
    regarding how the locations should be compared (e.g., by latitude, by city center,
    etc.). This leads to ambiguity in answering the question directly.
  - This question is asking whether the location identified by the zip code 48322
    in Michigan is north of the location identified by the zip code 01351 in Massachusetts.
    The interpretation of "north" is clear in this context, as it refers to geographical
    positioning on a map. Zip codes are specific to particular areas, and their relative
    positions can be determined by geographic coordinates. Therefore, there is only
    one interpretation and one correct answer to this question based on geographical
    data.
  - The question asks whether the location of one US zip code (48322 in Michigan)
    is north of another zip code (01351 in Massachusetts). Zip codes do not inherently
    convey geographic coordinates such as latitude, and without additional geographic
    context, they do not indicate north-south positioning. Additionally, zip codes
    are not typically compared in this manner, and the question assumes a geographic
    relationship based solely on zip code numbers, which could be misleading. This
    could lead to different interpretations based on assumptions about geographic
    knowledge or access to additional information about the actual locations. Therefore,
    the question admits more than one interpretation, making it ambiguous.
  - The question is asking if one zip code (48322, MI) is located north of another
    zip code (01351, MA). Zip codes are numerical codes used for mail delivery and
    do not inherently indicate geographical latitude or longitudinal positions. Additionally,
    the zip codes themselves do not provide specific latitude information, making
    it impossible to definitively determine the geographical north-south positioning
    solely based on zip code numbers. The question could be interpreted as asking
    about geographical latitude, but since zip codes do not correspond directly to
    latitude, this makes the question ambiguous without additional geographical information.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 48322 in Michigan is located north of the
    zip code 01351 in Massachusetts. However, zip codes are not arranged geographically
    in a way that directly correlates to latitude or longitude, so determining "north"
    based on zip codes alone is not straightforward. Furthermore, the numbers themselves
    do not indicate geographic position in terms of cardinal directions. Without additional
    geographic information, this question can be interpreted in different ways, such
    as considering the actual geographical locations of these zip codes or mistakenly
    trying to interpret zip codes as having inherent geographic directionality.
  - 'The question involves comparing the geographical locations of two zip codes:
    48322 in Michigan (MI) and 01351 in Massachusetts (MA). The question asks if one
    is located north of the other. While zip codes are numerical, they do not inherently
    provide geographical information about latitude. To answer the question, one would
    need to know the specific geographical coordinates or locations of these zip codes.
    However, the question is straightforward in its requirement to determine the relative
    north-south position of these two locations. There is only one interpretation
    of the question, which is to determine the relative latitude of the two zip codes.'
  - 'The question compares two US zip codes: 48322 in Michigan (MI) and 01351 in Massachusetts
    (MA), asking if one is located north of the other. Zip codes are numerical identifiers
    for postal delivery routes and do not directly correspond to geographical coordinates
    or latitude. The numbers themselves do not provide geographic information, and
    the question does not specify whether it refers to the geographic center of the
    areas or some other point within the zip codes. Therefore, this question is ambiguous
    because it relies on an assumption that zip codes can be compared based on their
    numerical values alone for geographic location, which is not accurate. Additionally,
    the question does not specify which part of each zip code area should be used
    for the comparison (e.g., the geographic center), leading to multiple interpretations
    and potential answers.'
  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographic location of two specific
    zip codes: 48322 in Michigan and 01351 in Massachusetts. However, the question
    is ambiguous because it uses zip codes to determine geographic north-south positioning,
    which is not a reliable method since zip codes are not assigned in a strictly
    geographical order. Additionally, the question does not specify whether it is
    asking about the geographic center of these zip codes or a specific point within
    them. Therefore, the question can be interpreted in multiple ways, leading to
    different answers.'
  - 'The question asks whether the zip code 48322 in Michigan is located north of
    the zip code 01351 in Massachusetts. The interpretation hinges on understanding
    the geographical locations associated with these zip codes. Zip codes are numerical
    representations for specific areas, and they do not inherently contain geographical
    directionality information like latitude or longitude. The interpretation of the
    question is straightforward: it is asking for a geographical comparison between
    two specific locations. Thus, it admits only one interpretation: checking the
    relative geographical positions of these two zip codes to determine which is north
    of the other.'

    may vary based on whether one is considering the central point of each zip code
    area or some other point within those areas. Furthermore, zip codes are not inherently
    ordered by latitude, so the question requires external geographic data to answer
    definitively. Despite these considerations, the question has a straightforward
    intent and can be answered with a clear geographic analysis.

  - The question is asking whether the location associated with the zip code 91803
    in California is geographically north of the location associated with the zip
    code 90048 in California. This can be interpreted clearly as a request for a geographical
    comparison based on latitude. There is a definitive answer based on the geographical
    coordinates of these zip codes. Therefore, the question admits one interpretation
    and one correct answer.
  - The question asks whether the location with the zip code 91803 is north of the
    location with the zip code 90048, both in California. Zip codes are numerical
    and do not inherently indicate geographic orientation such as north or south.
    However, the question can be interpreted in a straightforward manner by considering
    the actual geographic locations of the zip codes. Based on geographic data, 91803
    (Alhambra, CA) is indeed north of 90048 (West Hollywood, CA). This interpretation
    does not lead to multiple answers as geographic positions are fixed and can be
    determined accurately. Therefore, the question has only one interpretation and
    one correct answer.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 91803 is located north of the zip code
    90048. This question may initially seem clear, as it is asking for a geographical
    comparison based on latitude. However, it is ambiguous because zip codes are not
    always arranged in a strictly geographical order. Additionally, without a map
    or specific knowledge of these zip code areas, one cannot definitively determine
    which is further north just by the numbers. Furthermore, zip codes can cover areas
    that are not strictly north or south of each other, adding to the ambiguity.
  - The question is asking whether the location of the ZIP code 91803 in California
    is north of the location of the ZIP code 90048 in California. ZIP codes are numerical
    codes used by the United States Postal Service to identify specific geographic
    areas for mail delivery. However, ZIP codes do not inherently convey geographic
    information about latitude or longitude. The question assumes a geographic interpretation
    of ZIP codes, which may not be reliable for determining relative north-south positions.
    Furthermore, ZIP codes can cover various shapes and sizes, and their numbers do
    not necessarily correspond to geographic positioning. Therefore, the question
    could be interpreted differently based on whether one considers the numerical
    sequence or the actual geographic location of the ZIP codes. This makes the question
    ambiguous as it relies on an assumption that ZIP codes are geographically sequential,
    which is not always the case.
  - The question is asking whether the location of the zip code 91803 in California
    is north of the location of the zip code 90048 in California. While zip codes
    can be used to approximate locations, they do not always follow a strict north-south
    or east-west order. The question assumes that zip codes can be directly compared
    to determine geographical location, which is not always the case. Furthermore,
    zip codes do not inherently contain geographic orientation information. Without
    specific geographic coordinates or map references, the question is ambiguous because
    it relies on an assumption that zip code numbers correlate directly with latitude,
    which they do not.
  - 'The question is asking about the geographical location of two specific zip codes
    in California: 91803 and 90048. It specifically wants to know if 91803 is located
    north of 90048. This question is clear in its intent, as it asks for a straightforward
    comparison of the geographical positions of two fixed points. The interpretation
    is singular because zip codes have specific boundaries and can be precisely located
    on a map, allowing for a definitive answer about their relative positions.'
  - The question asks whether the location corresponding to the ZIP code 91803 in
    California is north of the location corresponding to the ZIP code 90048 in California.
    This question can be interpreted clearly as it pertains to the geographical locations
    of two specific ZIP codes and their relative positions. ZIP code 91803 corresponds
    to Alhambra, CA, and ZIP code 90048 corresponds to Los Angeles, CA (West Hollywood
    area). Geographically, Alhambra is located east and slightly north of the West
    Hollywood area, but primarily east, which may cause confusion if the emphasis
    is solely on the "north" aspect. However, since the question explicitly asks about
    the northern aspect, it leads to a single correct interpretation based on geographical
    coordinates.
  - The question asks if the location of the zip code 91803 in California is north
    of the zip code 90048 in California. Zip codes can generally be correlated with
    geographical areas, and with a map or database of zip codes, it is possible to
    determine their relative positions. The question is specific about two zip codes
    and asks for a geographical comparison in terms of direction (north), which is
    a clear and singular interpretation. The question is not open to multiple interpretations
    as it is factual and based on geographical data.
  - 'The question is asking whether the location of the zip code 91803 in California
    is north of the location of the zip code 90048 in California. This question can
    be interpreted in one clear way: determining the relative geographic location
    (north or south) of two specific zip codes within the state of California. Zip
    codes are fixed geographic areas, and their relative positions can be determined
    using geographic data or maps. Therefore, the question has one interpretation
    and can be answered definitively by referencing geographic coordinates or a map.'
  - The question is asking whether one specific ZIP code area (91803) is located north
    of another ZIP code area (90048) in California. The interpretation hinges on the
    geographical location of these ZIP codes, which is a straightforward matter of
    looking up their coordinates or relative positions on a map. There is only one
    correct answer based on their actual geographical locations. Therefore, the question
    does not allow for multiple interpretations and leads to a single correct answer.

  - The question asks whether one location (46506, IN) is north of another location
    (44065, OH). This could be interpreted as asking for a comparison of the latitude
    of these two zip codes. However, zip codes can represent areas rather than specific
    points, and without precise coordinates, there could be some ambiguity in determining
    "north" based on the zip code alone. Moreover, zip code boundaries can be irregular,
    adding to the potential for different interpretations regarding what "north" means
    in this context. Despite these potential ambiguities, the question itself is straightforward
    if interpreted as asking about the general north-south relationship based on latitude.
    Therefore, the question is specific enough to be classified as clear, given a
    common understanding of how to determine "north" in geographic terms.

  - The question asks whether the location of the zip code 10012 in New York is north
    of the location of the zip code 11756 in New York. This question is clear because
    it pertains to a specific geographic inquiry based on the relative positions of
    two well-defined zip codes. The interpretation is straightforward as it requires
    determining the relative geographic locations of the two zip codes, which can
    be answered by looking at a map or geographic data.
  - The question asks if the zip code 10012 in New York is located north of the zip
    code 11756 in New York. This question can be interpreted clearly in terms of geography.
    Each zip code represents a specific area and can be pinpointed on a map. Zip code
    10012 is in Manhattan, New York City, while zip code 11756 is in Levittown, Long
    Island. Based on geographical coordinates, one can determine which is located
    further north. Thus, the question admits only one interpretation and can be answered
    with a specific geographical reference.
  - The question asks if ZIP code 10012, NY is located north of ZIP code 11756, NY.
    ZIP codes can be used to identify specific geographic areas. However, the question
    assumes a geographic understanding of where each ZIP code is located without providing
    specific latitude or geographical data. ZIP code 10012 is in New York City (Manhattan),
    while 11756 is in Levittown, Long Island. Generally, Manhattan is north of Levittown.
    However, ZIP codes do not inherently convey clear north-south geographical relationships
    as they are not strictly organized by latitude. The interpretation relies on external
    geographical knowledge, but the question itself is straightforward in its intent
    to compare the geographical location in terms of north-south orientation.
  - The question is asking whether the location associated with the zip code 10012
    in New York is north of the location associated with the zip code 11756 in New
    York. While zip codes can be used to identify general locations, they do not directly
    translate to geographic coordinates such as latitude and longitude. Therefore,
    while the question appears straightforward, it may be considered ambiguous because
    zip codes can be non-contiguous and do not inherently convey geographical direction.
    Thus, the question could be interpreted in multiple ways, such as asking for a
    direct north-south comparison based on actual latitude or a more general directional
    sense, which can lead to different interpretations and answers.
  - The question is asking whether one US zip code (10012, NY) is located north of
    another (11756, NY). US zip codes are numerical codes used for mail delivery and
    do not inherently convey geographic information about their relative positions.
    However, given that both zip codes are specified to be in NY (New York), we can
    determine their relative geographic positions using external geographic data.
    Zip code 10012 is in Manhattan, New York City, and zip code 11756 is in Levittown,
    Long Island. Manhattan is geographically north of Levittown. Therefore, the question
    admits one clear interpretation regarding geographical location based on known
    data about these zip codes.

    in New York is situated to the north of the location represented by the zip code
    11756 in New York. This question appears to be straightforward as it involves
    comparing the geographical positions of two specific zip codes. Zip code 10012
    is in Manhattan, New York City, while zip code 11756 is in Levittown, Long Island.
    Since Manhattan is generally north of Levittown, the question seems to have a
    clear answer based on geographical data.
  - The question asks whether the location associated with the ZIP code 10012 in New
    York is north of the location associated with the ZIP code 11756 in New York.
    However, the question is ambiguous because ZIP codes do not necessarily follow
    a north-south geographical order. ZIP code 10012 is in Manhattan, while 11756
    is in Levittown, Long Island. Since ZIP codes are more related to postal routes
    than geographic location, interpreting north in terms of latitude or general direction
    can lead to different answers. Additionally, the question does not clarify whether
    it refers to direct north-south positioning or another form of comparison.
  - 'The question asks whether the zip code 10012 in New York is located north of
    the zip code 11756 in New York. Zip codes generally follow a geographical pattern
    but are not perfectly aligned with cardinal directions such as north-south. However,
    the question is clear in its intent to determine the relative geographical positions
    of the two specific zip codes. Therefore, it admits one interpretation: comparing
    the geographical locations based on latitude.'
  - The question is asking whether one zip code in New York is located north of another.
    The question involves geographic locations based on zip codes, which have specific
    boundaries. The zip code 10012 corresponds to an area in Manhattan, New York City,
    and 11756 corresponds to Levittown, New York, in Long Island. This comparison
    of locations based on latitude is straightforward and does not admit multiple
    interpretations. Therefore, the question can be answered definitively by comparing
    the geographical coordinates of the two locations.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographic location of two zip codes
    in New York, 10012 and 11756. The interpretation here is straightforward: it is

    answer.
  - The question asks whether a specific zip code in Tennessee (38555) is located
    north of a specific zip code in North Carolina (27233). While zip codes can provide
    some geographic indication, they are not strictly aligned with latitude, and zip
    codes can be non-contiguous or arranged based on postal routing rather than geographic
    location. Additionally, the question does not specify what metric or criteria
    are being used to determine "located north." Therefore, without additional context,
    the question could be interpreted in different ways, such as based on the central
    points of the zip codes or other criteria. This makes the question admit more
    than one interpretation.

    is north of the location associated with the zip code 32963 in Florida. This question
    seems straightforward as it is asking for a geographical comparison based on latitude.
    However, the potential ambiguity arises from the fact that zip codes do not necessarily
    follow a north-to-south order, and zip codes in Florida may not be logically sequenced
    in terms of latitude. Therefore, while the question seems to be seeking a clear
    geographical answer, the interpretation of zip codes as being inherently north
    or south of one another based on their numerical order could lead to confusion.
  - The question asks if the location corresponding to the zip code 33573 in Florida
    is north of the location corresponding to the zip code 32963 in Florida. The interpretation
    hinges on geographical data, specifically the latitude of the locations corresponding
    to these zip codes. The question is clear because it seeks a specific geographical
    comparison based on latitude, which can be determined using maps or databases
    of zip code locations. Thus, there is only one correct answer based on the geographical
    data.

  - The question is asking whether one zip code in Florida is located north of another
    zip code. While zip codes can give a general idea of location, they do not directly
    correspond to latitude or a specific north-south positioning. Additionally, zip
    codes are not assigned strictly in a north-to-south order, and thus two zip codes
    cannot be compared for north-south positioning based solely on their numerical
    order. Therefore, without additional geographic data or context, the question
    is open to interpretation regarding how to determine which zip code is north of
    the other.
  - The question asks whether the location of the zip code 33573 in Florida is north

  - The question asks whether the location associated with the zip code 01107 in Massachusetts
    is north of the location associated with the zip code 01129 in Massachusetts.
    Zip codes are primarily for mail delivery and do not always follow geographical
    or cardinal rules, and the question assumes that zip codes can be directly compared
    in terms of cardinal direction without additional geographic context. Additionally,
    zip codes can sometimes be non-contiguous or arranged in non-intuitive ways, which
    can lead to different interpretations or require additional geographic information
    to determine a precise answer. Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation
    regarding the spatial relationship between the two zip codes.
  - The question is asking whether one zip code in Massachusetts (01107) is located
    north of another zip code (01129) within the same state. While zip codes can give
    a general idea of location, they are not strictly geographic indicators. Zip codes
    were designed for mail delivery purposes and do not always follow geographic boundaries
    or directions. Thus, determining "north" based solely on zip code numbers is not
    reliable without additional geographic context. However, the question can still
    be answered definitively if one has access to a map or geographic data of the
    zip codes in question. Therefore, the question is specific and interpretable in
    one way, assuming the geographic data is available.

    seem straightforward, there are ambiguities present. Firstly, zip codes do not
    inherently indicate geographical latitude; they are primarily used for postal
    delivery purposes. Therefore, relying solely on zip codes to determine north-south
    geographical positioning is not accurate. Additionally, the question does not
    specify the criteria for determining "north of," such as whether it is based on
    the central point of the zip code area or another method. These factors contribute
    to the ambiguity of the question.

    this interpretation is clear. However, without additional context, it is unclear
    if the question intends to ask about something other than geographical north,
    such as economic status, population size, or other metrics, which would lead to
    different interpretations. Given the potential for multiple interpretations based
    on the lack of context, the question is ambiguous.'
  - The question asks if a specific zip code in Texas (79925) is located north of
    another specific zip code in Alabama (36037). While the question seems to be straightforward
    in asking for a geographical comparison, there is an inherent ambiguity in using
    zip codes for geographical positioning. Zip codes are not inherently geographic
    and can be non-contiguous or irregularly shaped. Additionally, without precise
    latitude and longitude data, the question relies on assumptions about the geographic
    locations of these zip codes. Thus, it admits more than one interpretation based
    on how one chooses to interpret or define the "location" of a zip code.
  - 'The question involves determining the relative geographical location of two US
    zip codes: 79925 in Texas and 36037 in Alabama. The interpretation depends on
    whether the zip codes are being used to refer to specific geographical points
    or areas within those zip codes. Zip codes can cover areas that vary in size and
    shape, and without specific reference points within those zip codes, the question
    can be interpreted in multiple ways. Additionally, the use of "north of" could
    refer to specific points within the zip codes or general areas, leading to potential
    ambiguity.'
  - The question is asking whether one specific location (79925, TX) is situated north
    of another specific location (36037, AL) based on their zip codes. Since zip codes
    correspond to specific geographic areas, this question can be interpreted as a
    straightforward comparison of geographic locations. Therefore, it admits only
    one interpretation and one correct answer based on the geographic positions of
    the zip codes in question.
  - The question is asking if the location of the zip code 79925 in Texas is north
    of the location of the zip code 36037 in Alabama. This is a geographical question
    about the relative positions of two specific points based on their zip codes.
    The question is clear in its intent, as it seeks a straightforward comparison
    of latitude between these two zip codes. However, without additional context or
    information, the question relies on knowing the geographical locations of these
    zip codes. Based on the provided data, 79925 (El Paso, TX) is indeed north of
    36037 (Greenville, AL), which can be verified with latitude information. Therefore,
    the question is clear and admits only one interpretation and one correct answer
    based on geographical data.
  - The question "Is 79925, TX located north of 36037, AL?" asks about the relative
    geographical locations of two zip codes. However, the question is ambiguous because
    zip codes are not inherently geographic indicators of north or south; they are
    primarily for postal delivery purposes. Additionally, the question could be interpreted
    in different ways, such as asking about the relative positions of the areas represented
    by the zip codes or the central points of these areas. Without specifying a method
    for determining "north" (e.g., based on central points, area centroids, or something
    else), the question admits multiple interpretations and could lead to different
    answers.
  - 'The question asks whether a particular zip code in Texas (79925) is located north
    of a zip code in Alabama (36037). The interpretation of the question is straightforward:
    it is asking about the geographical location in terms of latitude of these two
    zip codes. Zip codes are specific to areas within states, and this question can
    be answered by comparing the latitude of the two locations. There is only one
    interpretation and one correct answer based on geographical data.'
  - The question asks if a specific zip code in Texas (79925) is located north of
    a specific zip code in Alabama (36037). The interpretation relies on geographic
    locations based on zip codes, which are unique and correspond to specific areas.
    Given that zip codes are linked to specific geographic coordinates, there is only
    one interpretation regarding the relative north-south position of these two locations.
    Therefore, the question is clear and admits one correct answer based on geographic
    data.

  - The question is asking whether the location represented by the zip code 15014
    in Pennsylvania is geographically north of the location represented by the zip
    code 18102, also in Pennsylvania. While zip codes are primarily used for postal
    purposes and do not necessarily follow geographic order, they can sometimes provide
    a rough idea of location within a state. However, without specific geographic
    coordinates or a map, determining the precise north-south relationship based solely
    on zip codes could be misleading. Additionally, different interpretations of "located
    north" might arise depending on how one chooses to analyze the data (e.g., using
    centroid locations, postal regions, or city boundaries). Thus, the question could
    lead to different answers depending on the method used to determine "north of."
  - The question is asking about the geographical location of two specific zip codes
    in Pennsylvania, 15014 and 18102, relative to each other. The question seems straightforward
    at first glance, but it becomes ambiguous upon closer inspection. Zip codes are
    not inherently ordered by geographical latitude, so the numerical order of the
    zip codes does not directly correspond to their north-south positioning. The interpretation
    of "north" could mean either geographically north in terms of latitude or in terms
    of zip code numerical order, which can lead to different answers. Without additional
    context specifying whether the comparison is based on geographical position or
    numerical order, the question is ambiguous.
  - The question involves determining the geographical location of two zip codes in
    Pennsylvania, USA, specifically asking if one is located north of the other. Zip
    codes are numerical codes used for postal purposes and do not inherently convey
    geographical information such as latitude or longitude. Thus, interpreting the
    question requires external knowledge of the geographical locations of these zip
    codes. However, the question itself is not ambiguous because it asks for a specific
    directional relationship between two fixed locations. Given that zip codes correspond
    to specific areas, the question admits only one correct interpretation and answer
    based on the actual geographical data. Thus, it is clear in its intent and the
    type of answer it seeks.
  - The question involves comparing the geographical locations of two US zip codes
    to determine if one is located north of the other. However, the zip codes themselves
    (15014 and 18102) do not inherently provide geographical information such as latitude
    or north-south positioning. Zip codes are primarily designed for mail delivery
    routes and do not follow a strict geographical order. Therefore, without additional
    geographical data or context, the question is ambiguous because it relies on the
    assumption that zip codes can be directly compared for north-south positioning,
    which is not always the case.
  - The question asks whether one zip code (15014, PA) is located north of another
    zip code (18102, PA) within the state of Pennsylvania. Zip codes are primarily
    used for mail delivery purposes and do not necessarily follow geographical north-south
    or east-west lines. Therefore, interpreting the location of a zip code in terms
    of north or south based solely on the numbers without considering a map or geographical
    data can be misleading. Additionally, without a map or geographical data, it's
    unclear if the question is asking for a literal geographical interpretation or
    a symbolic interpretation based on zip code numbering. This allows for multiple
    interpretations, leading to potential ambiguity in the question.
  - The question involves comparing the locations of two US zip codes to determine
    their relative positions. However, zip codes are not inherently geographical in
    a way that allows for straightforward north-south comparisons. They are primarily
    used for mail delivery purposes and do not necessarily follow a linear geographical
    order. Additionally, the question does not specify the method or basis for determining
    "north" (e.g., latitude, map reading, etc.). Therefore, the question could be
    interpreted in multiple ways, leading to different answers depending on the criteria
    used for determining "north." This makes the question ambiguous.
  - The question is asking about the relative location of two zip codes within Pennsylvania.
    However, zip codes do not inherently convey geographic information in terms of
    north-south orientation. They are primarily used for postal delivery purposes
    and can be non-contiguous or arranged in non-geographic order. Therefore, the
    question is ambiguous because the zip code numbers themselves do not provide sufficient
    information to determine a north-south relationship. The answer could vary depending
    on additional geographic data that is not provided in the question.
  - The question asks if one zip code in Pennsylvania is located north of another
    zip code in Pennsylvania. While it might seem straightforward, the question is
    ambiguous because zip codes do not inherently provide geographical orientation
    or latitude-based positioning. Zip codes are primarily for postal routes and may
    not follow a north-south geographical order. Without additional geographical data,
    the question can be interpreted in different ways regarding how to determine which
    location is north of the other.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographical location of two zip codes
    in Pennsylvania, specifically whether 15014 is located north of 18102. On the
    surface, this seems like a straightforward geographical question. However, zip
    codes are not necessarily assigned in a geographical order and can be non-contiguous,
    so the question could be interpreted as either asking for a comparison of their
    numerical order or their actual geographical position. This ambiguity in interpretation
    can lead to different answers depending on how one interprets the question: by
    numerical order or by actual location on a map.'
  - The question is asking whether the location of the zip code 15014 in Pennsylvania
    is north of the location of the zip code 18102 in Pennsylvania. This question
    is based on geographical positions, which can be interpreted with a map or coordinate
    data. The zip codes themselves do not inherently contain geographical direction
    information, so determining "north" requires external geographical data. However,
    the question has a clear interpretation and seeks a factual answer based on the
    relative positions of these zip codes within Pennsylvania.

    north-south pattern. Without additional context or a map, the question could be
    interpreted in different ways: one interpretation is the literal geographical
    north based on latitude, and another interpretation could be based on the order
    of zip codes, which does not necessarily correspond to a north-south alignment.
    Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation, which could lead

  - The question is asking about the relative location of two specific zip codes within
    Illinois. Zip codes are numerical codes used for mail delivery and do not inherently
    provide geographic information such as direction (north, south, etc.). However,
    in practice, zip codes can often be used to approximate locations since they are
    assigned geographically. The question is clear in its intent, asking for a geographic
    comparison based on zip code numbers. It does not admit multiple interpretations,
    as it is specifically asking about the location of one zip code in relation to
    another. Therefore, it can be answered with geographic data relating to these
    zip codes.
  - 'The question is asking about the geographical location of two specific ZIP codes
    in Illinois: 60622 and 60651. The question is clear in its intent to determine

    data. There is only one interpretation and one correct answer based on the geographical
    locations of these zip codes.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 60622 is located north of the zip code
    60651 in Illinois. While zip codes can sometimes provide a rough indication of
    geographic location, they are not inherently designed to indicate precise cardinal
    directions such as "north" or "south." Additionally, zip codes can have irregular
    shapes and do not follow a strict linear order geographically. However, both zip
    codes are within the city of Chicago, and it is possible to determine their relative
    positions using a map or geographic data. Therefore, the question could be considered
    clear if interpreted as asking for the relative geographic positioning based on
    available data. However, without context or a map, the question can also be ambiguous
    because zip codes do not inherently imply direction. Thus, the question might
    lead to different interpretations regarding how to determine "north" without additional
    context or tools. The question is therefore classified as AMBIGUOUS.
  - The question asks if the zip code 60622 is located north of the zip code 60651,

  - The question involves determining the relative geographic locations of two zip
    codes in Texas. However, zip codes are primarily used for postal purposes and
    do not necessarily follow a logical geographic order. Without specific geographic
    knowledge or mapping of the zip codes, the question may seem straightforward,
    but it could be interpreted differently depending on one's understanding of how
    zip codes are organized. Additionally, since zip codes do not inherently convey
    geographic directionality, the question could be considered ambiguous due to the
    need for external geographic knowledge or resources to determine the answer.
  - The question asks whether the location of the zip code 77510 in Texas is north
    of the location of the zip code 78211 in Texas. This question could be considered
    clear because it asks for a specific geographical comparison based on the locations
    of two zip codes. However, it might be seen as ambiguous because the question
    does not specify the method of determining "north" (e.g., by the geographical
    center of the zip code area, by a specific point within the zip code, etc.). The
    question could lead to different interpretations depending on how one determines
    the location within each zip code. Therefore, the ambiguity arises from the unspecified

    zip code 35224 in Alabama. This question seems to have a straightforward interpretation:
    it is asking for a comparison of the geographical locations of these two zip codes
    in terms of latitude. Latitude is a clear and measurable geographic coordinate,
    so the question can be answered with a definite yes or no based on the actual
    geographic data of these zip codes. Therefore, the question is clear in its intent
    and scope.'
  - The question asks whether one zip code is located north of another. US zip codes
    are primarily numerical and do not inherently convey geographic information such
    as latitude or longitude. However, they are often assigned in a way that can provide
    a rough indication of location. In this case, 85250 is in Arizona and 35224 is
    in Alabama. Arizona is generally located to the west and somewhat north of Alabama.
    The question can be interpreted as asking for a simple north-south comparison
    based on general geographic knowledge of the states involved. While this interpretation
    is straightforward, the inherent ambiguity lies in the fact that zip codes do
    not directly convey precise geographic coordinates, and the question does not

  - The question asks whether the location associated with the ZIP code 01908 in Massachusetts
    is north of the location associated with the ZIP code 48221 in Michigan. ZIP codes
    do not inherently provide geographic information such as latitude or longitude,
    but given the context, it is reasonable to interpret the question as asking for
    a comparison of the geographic positions of these two locations. Since Massachusetts
    is generally located to the northeast of Michigan, it can be interpreted that
    01908, MA is indeed north of 48221, MI. Therefore, the question has one interpretation
    and a definitive answer based on geographical positions.
  - The question asks whether the location of the zip code 01908 in Massachusetts
    is north of the location of the zip code 48221 in Michigan. Zip codes can be used
    to determine general locations, and given that Massachusetts is generally to the
    east and slightly north of Michigan, one could interpret the question as asking
    about the relative geographic positions of these two locations. However, zip codes
    are not arranged strictly north-to-south or east-to-west, and without specific
    latitude and longitude data or a detailed map, the question could be interpreted
    differently. This makes the question somewhat ambiguous as zip codes alone don't
    inherently provide clear geographic north-south information. Additionally, the
    phrasing could lead to different interpretations regarding what is meant by "north
    of" (e.g., does it mean entirely north, or just generally north in a broader sense?).
  - The question asks if the location corresponding to the zip code 01908 in Massachusetts
    is north of the location corresponding to the zip code 48221 in Michigan. This
    is a straightforward question that involves comparing the geographical latitudes
    of two specific locations based on their zip codes. The question is clear in its
    intent, as it seeks a simple geographical comparison between two fixed points,
    which can be answered definitively by looking at a map or using geographic data.

  - The question asks whether a specific zip code in Massachusetts (01908) is located
    north of a specific zip code in Michigan (48221). This question seems to be asking
    about the geographical position of the two locations relative to each other, specifically
    in terms of latitude (north-south positioning). Since latitude is a measurable
    and consistent aspect of geography, there is only one correct answer to whether
    one location is north of another. Therefore, the question does not have multiple
    interpretations and leads to a single answer based on geographic data.
  - 'The question is asking about the geographical location of two US zip codes: 01908

  - The question is asking whether one location (11507, NY) is located north of another
    location (10021, NY) within the state of New York. On the surface, it seems straightforward
    as it asks for a geographic comparison. However, the question is ambiguous because
    ZIP codes do not inherently provide precise latitude information. ZIP codes are
    primarily for postal purposes and can cover areas of varying sizes and shapes.
    Therefore, without additional geographic data about the specific locations represented
    by these ZIP codes, the question cannot be definitively answered based solely
    on the ZIP code numbers. This can lead to multiple interpretations depending on
    how one interprets the relationship between ZIP codes and geographic locations.
  - 'The question asks about the relative geographical location of two zip codes in

    zip codes are understood as strictly geographical markers of latitude or if other
    factors, like postal boundaries that don''t strictly follow geographic lines,
    are considered. Additionally, the naming of a zip code with a city or state (e.g.,
    NY) could lead to confusion as zip codes can cross city or neighborhood lines.
    However, the primary reading of the question remains a geographic comparison of
    latitude between the two specified zip codes.'
  - The question involves geographic locations based on zip codes in New York. Zip
    codes themselves do not provide explicit information about geographic direction
    (north, south, etc.) as they are primarily for postal routing purposes. Thus,
    using zip codes alone to determine the relative geographic location could lead
    to different interpretations. Without additional context or specific geographic
    data, it's unclear whether zip codes provide a reliable basis for determining
    if one area is north of another.
  - The question asks whether zip code 11507 in New York is located north of zip code
    10021 in New York. However, zip codes are not inherently geographical indicators
    of north-south positioning. They are primarily used for mail delivery purposes
    and do not necessarily follow a north-to-south or east-to-west order. Therefore,
    the question is based on a misunderstanding of how zip codes work as geographical
    indicators, leading to ambiguity in the interpretation of "north." The question
    could be interpreted in terms of latitude, but without additional context, it
    remains unclear.
  - The question asks whether the location associated with the ZIP code 11507 in New
    York is north of the location associated with the ZIP code 10021 in New York.
    This question might seem straightforward, as it involves geographical locations
    that could be compared based on latitude. However, ZIP codes do not necessarily
    follow a north-to-south or east-to-west order, and their boundaries are not always
    aligned with geographical coordinates. Additionally, the question does not specify
    whether "north" refers to the geographic center of the ZIP codes, the northernmost
    point, or another specific criterion. Therefore, the question can be interpreted
    in multiple ways, leading to different answers depending on the interpretation
    of "located north."
  - The question asks whether the location of the zip code 11507 in New York is north
    of the zip code 10021, also in New York. While the question seems straightforward,
    it is ambiguous because zip codes are not strictly sequential by geographic latitude.
    The numbering of zip codes does not necessarily correlate with their geographic
    position (north or south). Therefore, interpreting the question based on zip code
    numbers alone would be misleading without additional geographic information. Thus,
    it could lead to different answers depending on the interpretation (e.g., numerical
    order vs. actual geographic location).
  - 'The question asks if one zip code area (11507, NY) is located north of another
    zip code area (10021, NY). While zip codes can provide some geographic information,
    they do not inherently contain directional or geographic data such as latitude
    or longitude. The interpretation of "north" in this context would require a geographic
    lookup of both zip codes to determine their relative positions. However, the question

    comparison between two specific locations. However, without additional context
    or specific criteria for determining what "located north" means (e.g., the northernmost
    boundary, the centroid of the area, etc.), there could be multiple interpretations
    of how to assess the "northernness" of a zip code. Additionally, zip code boundaries
    can be irregular and not strictly aligned north-south, which may complicate the
    determination. This introduces ambiguity in interpreting the spatial relationship
    between the two zip codes. Therefore, the question could lead to different answers
    based on the interpretation of "located north."

  - The question asks whether one zip code (11231, NY) is located north of another
    zip code (11436, NY). While the question appears to ask for a straightforward
    geographical comparison, zip codes are not necessarily arranged in a linear geographic
    order. Additionally, without specific knowledge of the geographic layout of these
    zip codes, the question could be interpreted differently, such as asking for postal
    or administrative information rather than strict geographic latitude. Therefore,
    the question admits more than one interpretation regarding what "north" might
    mean in this context.
  - The question asks whether a specific zip code, 11231, is located north of another
    zip code, 11436, both of which are in New York. Zip codes are not inherently geographical
    indicators of north-south positioning; they are numerical codes assigned to specific
    areas for mail delivery purposes. The question assumes that zip codes can be directly
    translated into geographical locations, which might not be accurate. Therefore,
    this question could be interpreted in different ways, depending on how one understands
    the correlation between zip codes and geographical positioning. As such, it admits
    more than one interpretation, leading to potentially different answers.
  - The question asks if one US zip code (11231, NY) is located north of another (11436,
    NY). The question seems to rely on the assumption that zip codes can be directly
    compared geographically based on their numbers, which is not necessarily valid.
    Zip codes are not assigned in a strictly geographic order, so their numeric values
    do not reliably indicate geographic locations relative to each other. This could
    lead to different interpretations, such as whether the question is asking about
    geographic location or some other factor related to zip codes. Additionally, the
    question could be interpreted as asking for a specific geographic comparison that
    might require additional geographic data or tools, which adds to the ambiguity.
  - The question asks if one zip code (11231, NY) is located north of another zip
    code (11436, NY). On the surface, this seems like a straightforward geographic
    query. However, zip codes do not necessarily follow a linear or logical geographic
    progression. While it's possible to determine the relative north-south position
    by looking up the specific locations of these zip codes, the question's reliance
    on zip codes rather than clear geographic markers like latitude makes it potentially
    confusing. Additionally, the use of "NY" suggests the state but doesn't specify
    whether the question considers the entirety of New York state or just New York
    City. These factors introduce ambiguity into the question because zip code numbering
    doesn't inherently convey geographic orientation.
  - 'The question asks whether one zip code (11231, NY) is located north of another
    zip code (11436, NY). The interpretation is straightforward: it is asking for
    a geographical comparison based on latitude between two specific zip codes. However,
    zip codes are not strictly organized in a linear north-south manner, and their
    numbering does not necessarily correspond to geographic location. Despite this,
    the question itself is clear in its request for a geographical comparison, not
    inquiring about anything else like population, area, or demographics. Therefore,
    the question admits only one interpretation: a geographical one based on latitude.'
  - The question asks whether one US zip code (11231, NY) is located north of another
    zip code (11436, NY). This question is ambiguous because zip codes are not arranged
    in a strictly geographical order, and the numerical order of zip codes does not
    necessarily correspond to their geographical location. Furthermore, determining
    "north" could refer to various aspects such as the centroid of the zip code area,
    specific boundaries, or particular landmarks within those zip codes. Thus, without
    additional context or criteria for what "located north" means in this context,
    the question admits multiple interpretations and potential answers.
  - The question asks whether the location with the zip code 11231 is north of the
    location with the zip code 11436, both in New York. While zip codes can suggest
    a general area, they do not necessarily provide precise geographical data in terms
    of latitude. Additionally, without specific knowledge or access to geographical
    coordinates or maps, it can be challenging to determine if one zip code is strictly
    north of another based solely on the zip code numbers. Therefore, the question
    might seem straightforward but lacks sufficient context or data for a definitive
    answer, leading to potential ambiguity in interpretation.
  - The question is asking whether the location of a specific zip code (11231, NY)

  - The question asks whether the location of the zip code 11231 in New York is north
    of the location of the zip code 11436 in New York. While the question seems straightforward,
    it assumes that zip codes correlate directly with geographical coordinates, which
    is not always the case. Zip codes are primarily for postal purposes and can have
    non-geographical order. Additionally, without specific latitude data or a map,
    it's challenging to determine the relative north-south positioning based solely
    on zip codes. Thus, the question can lead to different interpretations depending
    on one's understanding of zip code geography and available information.

  - The question is asking if one location (71341, LA) is north of another location
    (76513, TX) based on their zip codes. Zip codes are not designed to convey geographic
    information such as latitude or relative positioning, so using them to determine
    which location is north of the other could lead to multiple interpretations. One
    might try to look up the actual geographic locations associated with these zip
    codes to answer the question, but without that context, the zip codes alone do
    not provide a clear answer. Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation
    depending on how one chooses to interpret the use of zip codes for geographic
    positioning.
  - The question asks whether the location of the zip code 71341 in Louisiana is north

  - The question involves determining the relative location of two places based on
    their zip codes. While the zip codes 71341 and 76513 correspond to areas in Louisiana
    (LA) and Texas (TX), respectively, zip codes themselves do not directly indicate
    geographic location or directionality such as "north" or "south." Therefore, to
    answer the question, one would need to look up the specific geographic locations
    associated with these zip codes. However, the question is clear in its intention
    to compare the geographical latitude of two specific areas. Thus, the question
    itself is clear, although the method to determine the answer requires additional
    information beyond the zip codes.

    as it pertains to geographical location. However, the question assumes that zip
    codes directly correspond to geographical coordinates, which is not always accurate.
    Zip codes are primarily for postal service efficiency and do not always follow
    a logical geographic order. Additionally, the question does not specify the criteria
    for "north" (e.g., based on the geographic center of the zip code area). These
    factors introduce ambiguity as different interpretations of "north" could lead
    to different answers.

  - This question is asking for a geographical comparison between two specific zip
    codes in New York, 10703 and 11789, to determine which one is located further
    north. The question is clear as it specifies the zip codes and the direction (north)
    for the comparison. There is only one correct interpretation and answer based
    on geographical data.
  - The question asks about the relative location of two specific zip codes within
    New York. It is clear in its request for geographic orientation (north vs. south)
    between the two zip codes. Given that zip codes are specific geographic entities,
    the question can be interpreted in only one way, which involves comparing the
    latitude of the two locations. There is no ambiguity in the interpretation of
    the question, as it pertains solely to geographic location based on zip codes.
  - The question asks whether one location in New York, identified by its ZIP code
    (10703), is located north of another location in New York, identified by a different
    ZIP code (11789). ZIP codes in the United States are primarily used for mail delivery
    and do not necessarily indicate geographical positioning in terms of north or
    south. Therefore, the question is ambiguous because ZIP codes do not provide sufficient
    geographical information to determine the relative north-south positioning of
    two locations. Additionally, without specific knowledge of the locations associated
    with these ZIP codes, it's unclear whether the question refers to their geographical
    positions or their numerical order.
  - The question asks whether one specific zip code in New York is located north of
    another zip code in the same state. The interpretation of "north" is straightforward
    as it refers to geographical latitude. The question is clear in its intent to
    compare the relative geographical positions of the two specified zip codes. There
    is only one correct answer based on the geographical data of the zip codes provided.
    Thus, the question admits only one interpretation and one correct answer.
  - The question is asking whether one location (10703, NY) is located north of another
    location (11789, NY) based on their ZIP codes. While ZIP codes can give a general
    idea of location, they are not necessarily aligned in a strictly north-south manner.
    Therefore, the interpretation of the question depends on whether the ZIP codes
    are assumed to represent geographic coordinates, which they do not precisely do.
    Additionally, without specific geographic knowledge or a map, this question could
    lead to different interpretations and answers regarding the relative positioning
    of these ZIP codes in New York.
  - The question asks whether the location associated with the zip code 10703 in New
    York is situated to the north of the location associated with the zip code 11789
    in New York. This question involves geographic locations based on zip codes and
    is subject to interpretation based on how one defines "north." While zip codes
    can provide general areas, they don't directly correlate to specific geographic
    coordinates or boundaries without additional context. Additionally, the question
    does not specify what is meant by "located north" (e.g., based on central points,
    area coverage, or another criterion), which could lead to different interpretations
    and answers. Therefore, the question is ambiguous due to the lack of specificity
    in defining the criteria for "north."
  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographical location of two zip codes
    in New York: 10703 and 11789. While it might seem straightforward, there is an
    ambiguity in determining what "north" means in this context. Zip codes do not
    necessarily follow a geographical pattern that aligns perfectly with cardinal
    directions. Additionally, the question does not specify whether it is asking for
    the northernmost point of each zip code or the general location. Therefore, there
    could be multiple interpretations of what it means for one zip code to be "north"
    of another.'
  - "The question is asking whether a specific location in New York, identified by\
    \ the zip code 10703, is situated north of another location identified by the\
    \ zip code 11789. The question assumes that zip codes can be used to determine\
    \ geographical positions in terms of latitude. However, zip codes do not necessarily\
    \ correlate with geographic north-south positions, as they are primarily used\
    \ for postal delivery purposes and do not follow a strict geographical order.\
    \ Thus, interpreting the question to mean a geographical north-south comparison\
    \ based solely on zip codes is problematic. This could lead to different interpretations\
    \ regarding what is being asked\u2014whether it refers to geographic location\
    \ or merely a postal code comparison."
  - The question asks whether one zip code in New York is located north of another
    zip code. The interpretation of "north" is geographically straightforward, meaning
    one location is at a higher latitude than another. However, the question is ambiguous
    because it depends on the specific geographic boundaries of the zip codes in question.
    Zip code areas can be irregularly shaped, so without precise geographic coordinates
    or more specific data, there could be multiple interpretations of "north" within
    those zip code boundaries. Thus, it admits more than one interpretation, which
    could lead to different answers based on how one interprets or measures "north"
    within the zip code areas.
  - The question is asking whether the location corresponding to the zip code 10703
    is north of the location corresponding to the zip code 11789, both in New York.
    This question is geographically based and can be answered by looking at a map
    or using geographical coordinates. The interpretation is straightforward, with
    a single focus on geographical location. Therefore, it admits only one interpretation
    and one correct answer based on the geographical positions of the zip codes.
