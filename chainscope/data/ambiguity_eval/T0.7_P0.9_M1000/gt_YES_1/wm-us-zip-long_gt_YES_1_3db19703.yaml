  - The question asks whether the location associated with the zip code 92108 is east
    of the location associated with the zip code 92307, both of which are in California.
    Zip codes are not inherently geographic coordinates but rather postal codes, which
    can lead to ambiguity in interpreting "east" because it depends on the specific
    geographic areas covered by these zip codes. Additionally, zip codes can cover
    irregularly shaped areas. Therefore, the question could be interpreted in different
    ways depending on the specific boundaries and central points of these zip codes,
    making it potentially ambiguous.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 92108 in California is located east of
    the zip code 92307 in California. This question is potentially ambiguous because
    zip codes do not always correspond directly to geographic coordinates in a straightforward
    way. While zip codes often follow a general geographic pattern, there can be exceptions
    due to the way they are assigned. Additionally, without specific geographic data
    or a map, there may be multiple interpretations of what "east" means in this context,
    especially considering the irregular shapes and boundaries of zip code areas.
    Therefore, the question could lead to different answers based on how one interprets
    the geographic layout of these zip codes.
  - The question asks whether the location associated with the ZIP code 92108 in California
    is east of the location associated with the ZIP code 92307 in California. The
    interpretation of the question is straightforward as it involves a geographic
    determination based on the positions of the two ZIP codes. Each ZIP code corresponds
    to a specific geographic area, and the question is asking for a comparison of
    their relative positions. Therefore, this question admits only one interpretation
    and one correct answer based on geographic data.
  - 'The question asks whether the zip code 92108 is located east of zip code 92307,
    both of which are in California. This is a straightforward question about the
    geographical positioning of two zip codes relative to each other. The interpretation
    is clear: it is asking for a comparison of their longitudinal positions, which
    can be determined using a map or geographic data. Therefore, there is only one
    correct answer based on their actual locations.'
  - The question asks whether the location of the zip code 92108 in California is
    east of the location of the zip code 92307 in California. The interpretation of
    the question is straightforward, as it involves determining the relative geographical
    positions of two specific zip codes. There is a single correct answer based on
    the geographical locations of these zip codes. Therefore, the question is clear
    and does not admit multiple interpretations.
  - The question asks if the zip code 92108 is located east of the zip code 92307
    within California. Zip codes are numerical codes used for mail delivery and do
    not inherently provide geographic information about east or west locations. Determining
    if one zip code is east of another requires additional geographic data or mapping,
    as zip codes do not follow a linear east-west progression. Without specific geographic
    information, the question can be interpreted in various ways, such as looking
    at longitude coordinates or using a map. Therefore, the question admits more than
    one interpretation regarding how to determine "east of" based solely on zip codes.
  - 'The question is asking whether the location of one zip code in California is
    east of another zip code in California. Zip codes are numerical and do not inherently
    contain geographical information about their relative east-west positions. Determining
    the relative positions of these two zip codes would require additional geographical
    data or a map, which is not provided in the question. However, the interpretation
    of the question itself is clear: it asks for a comparison of the geographical
    locations of the two zip codes based on their longitudinal positions. Therefore,
    the question admits only one interpretation and requires specific geographical
    data to answer.'
  - The question involves determining the geographical location of two specific zip
    codes, 92108 and 92307, both in California. Zip codes are numerical codes that
    are used to identify specific areas, but they do not inherently provide clear

    that zip codes alone cannot provide. The question does not specify whether the
    comparison is based on central points of the zip code areas, which can vary in
    size and shape. Additionally, zip codes are primarily for postal purposes and
    do not correspond directly to geographical coordinates in a way that allows for
    a simple east/west comparison without additional context or data. This leads to
    multiple interpretations and possible answers depending on how one defines the
    comparison. Therefore, the question is ambiguous.
  - The question asks whether one US zip code is located east of another. Zip codes
    are not inherently geographic coordinates, but they can be approximately associated

  - The question is asking whether one zip code (85745) is located east of another
    zip code (85746) within Arizona. While zip codes can provide a general sense of
    location, they are not inherently directional and do not follow a strict east-to-west
    or north-to-south progression. Therefore, determining the relative east-west position
    of two zip codes based solely on the numbers is not straightforward and may depend
    on specific geographic knowledge. This introduces ambiguity because the answer
    could vary based on different interpretations of how to determine "east" in this
    context (e.g., geographic coordinates, zip code area boundaries, etc.).
  - The question asks whether the location represented by the zip code 85745 in Arizona
    is east of the location represented by the zip code 85746 in Arizona. The interpretation
    of "east" in this context refers to geographical direction, which is a clear and
    straightforward inquiry that can be answered using geographical data on the zip
    codes' locations. Therefore, the question admits one interpretation and one correct
    answer based on the geographical positions of the zip codes.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 85745 is located east of the zip code 85746,
    both in Arizona. The interpretation hinges on geographical location, specifically
    whether one zip code is geographically east of the other. Zip codes are not strictly
    sequential geographically, and without a map or specific geographic data, determining
    the relative east-west position is not straightforward. Therefore, the question
    could lead to different answers based on available information or assumptions
    about zip code numbering.
  - The question asks whether one zip code is located east of another within the same
    state (Arizona). The interpretation depends on the geographical information of
    the zip codes. Zip codes are not inherently directional, and their numbering is
    not necessarily indicative of their geographical location relative to each other.
    Therefore, the question could be interpreted in different ways depending on whether
    one has access to the geographical locations of the zip codes in question. Without
    specific geographical data, the question admits multiple interpretations and potential
    answers.
  - The question is asking if the ZIP code 85745 is located east of ZIP code 85746,
    both in Arizona. ZIP codes are not inherently geographic in terms of east-west
    orientation, as they are primarily used for postal delivery purposes. While there
    might be a general geographic progression in some areas, it is not consistent
    or reliable for determining east-west location without additional context. Furthermore,
    the question does not provide specific geographic reference points to determine
    what is considered "east," which adds to the ambiguity. Therefore, the question
    admits more than one interpretation regarding the geographic positioning based
    solely on ZIP codes.
  - The question involves determining the geographical location of two ZIP codes,
    85745 and 85746, both of which are in Arizona (AZ). ZIP codes are generally assigned

    in terms of cardinal directions like east or west. Without additional context
    or a map, it is unclear if 85745 is east of 85746. As such, the question could
    be interpreted in multiple ways, depending on how one assumes ZIP codes are geographically
    organized. This leads to potential ambiguity in answering the question. Therefore,
    the question admits more than one interpretation, which could lead to different
    answers based on different assumptions or additional geographical information.

  - The question asks whether the zip code 60406 in Illinois is located east of the
    zip code 60466 in Illinois. This question is asking for a geographical comparison
    between two specific locations based on their zip codes. Zip codes are specific
    to particular regions, and their relative positions can be determined using geographical
    data. Therefore, this question admits only one interpretation regarding the relative
    east-west positioning of these two zip codes, based on their geographical locations.
    It does not introduce any ambiguity in terms of its intent or the information
    required to answer it.
  - The question asks whether one location (60406, IL) is east of another location
    (60466, IL) based on their zip codes. Zip codes are numerical representations
    used for mail delivery and do not inherently provide geographical orientation
    or distance information. Additionally, zip codes in the United States do not follow
    a consistent geographical pattern (e.g., increasing or decreasing from east to
    west). Thus, determining the geographical relationship (east or west) between
    two zip codes based solely on their numbers is not possible without additional
    geographical data. This makes the question ambiguous as it could be interpreted
    in various ways depending on available geographical data about the specific locations.
  - The question asks whether the location associated with the zip code 60406 in Illinois
    is east of the location associated with the zip code 60466 in Illinois. This can
    be interpreted in a straightforward geographic context, where "east" is a specific
    direction on a map. However, the question could be ambiguous if considering factors
    such as the geographic center of each zip code area or if there are specific nuances
    in how "east" is defined (e.g., is it purely longitudinal, or does it consider
    other factors?). Without additional context or specific criteria for what constitutes
    "east," the question may lead to different interpretations regarding the basis
    of comparison.
  - The question asks whether the location of one US zip code (60406, IL) is east
    of another zip code (60466, IL). While the question seems straightforward, it
    is ambiguous because it relies on the assumption that zip codes are organized
    in a geographic manner that allows for such directional interpretation. Zip codes
    are primarily used for mail delivery purposes and do not necessarily follow a
    strict geographic or directional order. Furthermore, without specific geographic
    coordinates or maps, determining the relative east-west position of these zip
    codes may lead to different interpretations. Therefore, the question can be interpreted
    differently depending on the understanding of zip code organization and available
    geographic data.
  - 'The question involves determining the relative geographical positions of two
    zip codes in Illinois: 60406 and 60466. While zip codes generally follow a rough
    geographic pattern, they are not always strictly sequential in terms of east-west
    or north-south positioning. Therefore, without a specific map or reference to
    the geographic coordinates or detailed knowledge of the region, it is not possible
    to definitively determine the relative east-west positioning of these zip codes
    based solely on the numbers. This question admits multiple interpretations because
    it could be asking for a simple numeric comparison, a geographic comparison based
    on zip code numbering, or an actual geographic location comparison. Thus, it could
    lead to different answers depending on the interpretation.'
  - The question asks whether one zip code (60406, IL) is located east of another
    zip code (60466, IL). While the question seems straightforward, it is ambiguous
    because zip codes do not inherently convey precise geographical coordinates or
    direct east-west relationships. Zip codes are primarily used for postal delivery
    purposes and do not follow a strict geographical ordering. Therefore, determining
    whether one zip code is east of another requires additional geographical information,
    which is not provided in the question. Without this information, the question
    admits more than one interpretation and potential answers based on different geographical
    data sources.
  - The question asks whether the location corresponding to the US zip code 60406
    in Illinois is east of the location corresponding to the zip code 60466 in Illinois.
    While zip codes can provide some general geographic information, they do not inherently
    convey precise longitudinal data necessary to determine east-west positioning.
    Furthermore, zip code boundaries are not strictly aligned with cardinal directions.
    Thus, without additional context or a detailed map, it is ambiguous whether 60406
    is east of 60466 based solely on the zip codes themselves.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 60406 is located east of the zip code 60466
    in Illinois. This is a geographical question that relies on the spatial relationship

    locations relative to each other can be determined using maps or geographical
    data. Therefore, the question has only one interpretation regarding geographical
    positioning and can be answered definitively by looking at the map or geographical
    coordinates of these zip codes.
  - 'The question asks whether one zip code (60406, IL) is located east of another
    zip code (60466, IL) within the state of Illinois. This question is clear because

    and 52328, within the state of Iowa (IA). The question is asking if 52402 is located
    east of 52328. Zip codes are specific to certain geographic areas, and their relative
    positions can be determined by maps or geographic data. Therefore, the question
    has a clear geographic basis and can be answered definitively by checking the
    relative locations of the two zip codes. There is only one interpretation of the
    question, which is to compare the geographical positions of the two zip codes
    in terms of east-west orientation.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 52402 is located east of the zip code 52328
    within the state of Iowa. While zip codes are numerical and can be geographically
    mapped, they do not inherently provide directional information such as east or
    west. To answer this question accurately, one would need to look at a map or have
    specific knowledge of the geography of these zip codes. However, the question
    itself is clear in its intent and does not admit multiple interpretations. It
    asks for a directional comparison between two specific locations, which can be
    answered definitively with the appropriate geographical data.

    of these two zip codes. There is only one way to interpret the question, which
    is to check the geographical coordinates (longitude and latitude) to establish
    their relative positions. Therefore, the question admits only one interpretation
    and one correct answer.'
  - The question asks whether the zip code 52402 is located east of the zip code 52328
    in Iowa. This question is ambiguous because zip codes are not inherently directional
    and do not follow a strict geographical pattern. The numerical order of zip codes
    does not necessarily correspond to geographical locations such as east or west.
    Therefore, without additional geographical data or context, the question can be
    interpreted in multiple ways and could lead to different answers.
  - The question is asking whether the location of one zip code (52402, IA) is east
    of another zip code (52328, IA). While zip codes are generally numerical and can
    provide some geographic information, they are not strictly organized in a way
    that aligns with cardinal directions. Additionally, without specific geographic
    data or maps, determining the precise eastern location of one zip code relative
    to another can be ambiguous. Therefore, this question could be interpreted in
    different ways depending on the method or data used to establish the relative
    positions of the zip codes.
  - 'The question asks if the zip code 52402, located in Iowa (IA), is east of the

    data, which can be misleading without specific geographic knowledge or a map.
    This makes the question ambiguous as it admits more than one interpretation based
    on the method used to determine 'east' or 'west'.
  - The question asks if a specific zip code (52402, IA) is located east of another
    zip code (52328, IA). This question involves geographical location comparison
    based on zip codes, which can be interpreted using a map or geographical data.
    Zip codes are numerical and do not inherently convey geographical direction, but
    they can be used to identify specific areas which can then be compared for relative
    location. The question is clear in its request for a geographical east-west comparison
    between two specific locations identified by their zip codes.
  - The question involves determining the relative location of two zip codes, 52402
    and 52328, in Iowa (IA). Zip codes are numerical and typically assigned geographically.
    However, without specific mapping information, it is unclear if the numerical
    order corresponds to a specific east-west orientation. The question assumes that
    the zip code numbers directly relate to geographic direction, which might not
    be accurate. Therefore, without additional geographic data or a map, the question
    can be interpreted in different ways depending on the assumptions made about zip
    code organization.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographical location of two zip codes
    within Iowa, 52402 and 52328. The interpretation involves determining which zip
    code is located to the east of the other, based solely on their zip code numbers.
    However, zip codes do not always follow a strict geographical pattern, and they
    are not necessarily assigned in a way that correlates directly with east-west
    location. Thus, the question could be interpreted in multiple ways: one might
    consider zip codes as geographical indicators, while another interpretation might
    involve using a map to verify actual locations. This leads to potential ambiguity
    in how to determine "east of" based on zip codes alone.'

    can be plotted on a map to determine their relative positions, the question may
    be considered ambiguous because ZIP codes are not inherently directional. Additionally,
    without additional geographic context or a map reference, determining the relative
    east-west positioning based solely on ZIP codes can be misleading or unclear to
    someone unfamiliar with the specific areas. Thus, the question admits more than
    one interpretation depending on one's familiarity with the geography of New Jersey
    ZIP codes and how one interprets the use of ZIP codes to describe locations.
  - The question asks about the geographical location of two specific zip codes in

    answer based on the specific coordinates of the ZIP code areas. However, ZIP codes
    themselves do not inherently contain information about their geographic longitude
    or east-west positioning, and without explicit longitude data, multiple interpretations
    could arise (e.g., whether it refers to ZIP code numeric order, geographic location,
    etc.). Therefore, the question may be considered ambiguous due to the lack of
    explicit context regarding how "east" is being defined or measured.

    and do not inherently describe geographic east-west positioning. Therefore, the
    question could be interpreted as asking for a geographical comparison based on
    postal codes, which is not a reliable method for determining east-west positioning.
    This leads to multiple interpretations regarding how to assess the relative positions
    of these zip codes, which could result in different answers depending on the method
    used for interpretation (e.g., postal code order vs. actual geographic coordinates).
    Thus, the question is ambiguous.

    on a map. However, the question could be seen as ambiguous because it does not
    specify the criteria for determining "east of." While geographic coordinates can
    provide a clear answer, without specifying whether the comparison is based on
    longitudinal coordinates, road distances, or another metric, there might be different
    interpretations of "east of." Nonetheless, typically, "east of" would be interpreted
    as a longitudinal comparison, making it relatively straightforward to determine
    using geographic data.
  - The question asks whether one zip code in New Jersey (08026) is located east of
    another zip code (08867) within the same state. The interpretation hinges on the
    geographical location of these zip codes. Zip codes are specific and geographically
    defined, meaning they have fixed locations. Therefore, the question can be interpreted
    straightforwardly by examining the geographical positions of these zip codes relative
    to each other. Since zip codes have specific geographic boundaries, the question
    can be answered definitively by determining their relative positions on a map.
  - The question asks whether one specific zip code in New Jersey is located east

  - The question is asking if one location, represented by the zip code 03057 in New
    Hampshire (NH), is geographically east of another location, represented by the
    zip code 03070 in New Hampshire. Zip codes are not inherently directional or geographic
    beyond their assignment to specific regions, and without specific geographic data
    or maps, determining whether one zip code is east of another requires additional
    context or information. Without a map or additional geographic data, the question
    cannot be definitively answered based solely on the zip codes themselves. This
    leads to ambiguity as different interpretations or sources could yield different

  - The question is asking whether one location (12123, NY) is east of another location
    (11510, NY) based on their zip codes. This question is clear in its intention
    as it seeks to determine the relative geographical position of two specific zip
    code areas within New York state. Zip codes are specific and unique to geographical
    areas, which allows for a clear determination of their relative positions. Therefore,
    the question admits only one interpretation and one correct answer based on geographical
    data.
  - The question asks if a specific location identified by the zip code 12123 in New
    York is located east of another location identified by the zip code 11510, also

    interpretation and has one correct answer based on geographical data.
  - The question asks if one zip code in New York is located east of another. The
    question may seem straightforward, but the ambiguity arises from how locations
    are interpreted based solely on zip codes. Zip codes are not necessarily arranged
    in geographical order and do not provide precise east-west orientation information.
    Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation depending on how one
    interprets the relationship between zip codes and geographical locations, which
    could lead to different answers.
  - The question is asking if one location (12123, NY) is east of another location
    (11510, NY) within New York state. While the question appears to be straightforward,
    there is ambiguity because it relies on interpreting "east" in the context of
    geographic locations defined by zip codes, which may not perfectly align with
    longitudinal coordinates. Additionally, zip codes are not always aligned in a
    strictly east-west manner due to their purpose of postal routing rather than geographic
    precision. Thus, the question admits more than one interpretation regarding the
    exact positioning of these zip codes in terms of longitude.
  - The question asks whether one zip code in New York (12123) is located east of
    another zip code in New York (11510). This is a straightforward geographical question

    (11510, NY). This can be interpreted in a straightforward manner as a geographical
    question about the relative longitudinal positions of the two zip codes. The question
    is clear in its intent and only admits one interpretation, which can be answered
    by looking at the geographical coordinates (longitude) of the two zip codes. Therefore,
    the question is clear and has one correct answer based on geographical data.
  - The question asks if one zip code (12123, NY) is located east of another zip code
    (11510, NY). Zip codes are numerical representations of geographic areas, and
    their numbers do not correspond to specific geographic directions or locations.
    However, the question implies a comparison of geographic locations based on zip
    codes, which is a clear interpretation. The answer can be determined by looking
    at a map or using geographic coordinates. Therefore, the question admits one interpretation
    regarding geographic location and can have one correct answer based on that interpretation.
  - The question asks if the location associated with the ZIP code 12123 in New York
    is east of the location associated with the ZIP code 11510 in New York. ZIP codes
    can be used to determine relative geographic locations, and given that both ZIP
    codes are in New York, the question implies a straightforward geographic comparison.
    However, without specific geographic coordinates or a reliable map, ZIP codes
    alone are not always a precise indicator of east-west orientation, especially
    since ZIP codes are primarily for postal purposes. The question assumes that ZIP
    codes can be used to determine east-west direction accurately, which is not always
    the case. Additionally, the question lacks context about the basis of "east,"
    which could be interpreted differently based on the map projection or method used
    for determining east-west direction. This introduces ambiguity in the interpretation
    of the question.

  - The question involves determining the relative location of two zip codes, 46237
    and 46561, within the state of Indiana (IN). Zip codes are numerical and geographical
    representations primarily used for mail delivery purposes, and they do not inherently
    provide directional information like latitude or longitude. Without additional
    geographical data or mapping tools, it is not possible to definitively determine
    if one zip code is east of another based solely on their numerical values. Furthermore,
    zip codes do not follow a strict geographical pattern that would allow for such
    a determination without ambiguity. Therefore, the question can be interpreted
    in different ways depending on the method used to determine "east of," such as
    using geographical coordinates or relying on local knowledge, leading to potential
    variability in answers.
  - The question asks if the location associated with the zip code 46237 in Indiana
    is located east of the location associated with the zip code 46561 in Indiana.

    based on geographic information.
  - 'The question involves determining the relative geographical locations of two
    zip codes: 46237 and 46561, both in Indiana. The question''s clarity hinges on
    the understanding that zip codes can be used to identify specific areas, but they
    don''t inherently provide information about their relative positions such as east
    or west. Without additional context or specific mapping data, zip codes alone
    do not definitively indicate geographical direction. Therefore, the question can
    be interpreted in multiple ways depending on how one chooses to determine "east"
    or "west" (e.g., relying on external map data or assuming a numerical sequence).
    Thus, the question is ambiguous because it lacks sufficient information to provide
    a single, definitive answer based solely on the zip codes provided.'
  - The question is asking about the relative location of two zip codes, 46237 and
    46561, within the state of Indiana (IN). The zip code system in the United States

    or south. Determining whether one zip code is east of another requires additional
    geographic information, such as latitude and longitude coordinates or a map. Therefore,
    without explicit geographic data, the question could be interpreted in multiple
    ways, leading to different answers based on different sources or assumptions about
    the location of these zip codes. This makes the question ambiguous.

    it with geographic locations. Since geographical locations can be precisely determined
    and compared for their longitudinal position, this question has a single interpretation
    and a definitive answer based on geographic data.
  - The question asks whether a specific zip code in Kentucky (41240) is located east
    of a specific zip code in Florida (33756). The interpretation of "east" in this
    context is straightforward, referring to the geographical location of one place
    relative to another. Since geographic coordinates provide a clear basis for determining
    whether one location is east of another, the question admits only one interpretation
    and one correct answer based on the longitudinal positions of the two zip codes.
  - 'The question asks whether a specific location in Kentucky (with the zip code
    41240) is located east of a specific location in Florida (with the zip code 33756).

    (east) that is being queried. There is only one correct geographical interpretation:
    determining the longitudinal positions of the two zip codes to ascertain which
    is east of the other.'
  - The question is asking if a specific zip code in Kentucky (41240) is located east
    of a specific zip code in Florida (33756). Zip codes are numerical identifiers
    for postal delivery routes, and they do not inherently provide geographical coordinates
    or directional information such as "east" or "west." Therefore, the question requires
    interpretation beyond just the numbers to determine if one location is geographically
    east of another. However, given the context of Kentucky and Florida, the question
    might be asking about the general geographical locations of these states. This
    makes the question ambiguous because it mixes postal code information with geographical
    directions, leading to different interpretations (either based on zip code numbers
    or geographical locations). Therefore, it admits more than one interpretation.
  - The question asks if a specific location in Kentucky (41240) is east of a specific
    location in Florida (33756). This question is based on geographical locations,
    and generally, Florida is located to the east of Kentucky. Thus, the interpretation
    is straightforward with a single geographic context, leading to one correct answer.
    The question does not have multiple interpretations and is based on factual geographic
    information.
  - The question is asking whether a specific zip code in Kentucky (41240) is located
    east of a specific zip code in Florida (33756). Since zip codes are geographical
    identifiers, their locations can be precisely determined. However, the question
    does not specify whether it is asking about the general location of the zip codes
    or the specific locations of the areas they cover, which might have non-overlapping
    boundaries that could complicate a straightforward east-west comparison. Furthermore,
    the question could be interpreted as asking about the central point of these zip
    codes or the furthest eastern point within each zip code. These interpretations
    could lead to different answers. Due to these potential variations in interpretation,
    the question is ambiguous.
  - The question asks if the zip code 41240 in Kentucky is located east of the zip
    code 33756 in Florida. Geographically, Florida is generally east of Kentucky.
    Therefore, it is clear that the question refers to geographical east-west positioning.
    The question admits only one interpretation and one correct answer based on geographical
    location.
  - The question is asking whether a location with the zip code 41240 in Kentucky
    (KY) is east of a location with the zip code 33756 in Florida (FL). This can be
    interpreted in terms of geographic coordinates, where 'east' refers to longitude.
    However, the phrasing is somewhat confusing because typically, Kentucky is located
    to the west of Florida. The question might be trying to ask about specific points
    within those states, but it is not clear if it refers to the geographic centers,
    specific addresses, or any other criteria. Additionally, zip codes do not inherently
    provide longitudinal information, making it challenging to definitively determine
    east-west positioning based solely on zip codes. Therefore, the question admits
    more than one interpretation regarding what is being compared and how, leading
    to different possible answers.
  - The question is asking whether one specific location (41240, KY) is east of another
    specific location (33756, FL). US zip codes are uniquely assigned to specific
    geographic areas, so there is only one interpretation of each zip code's location.
    The question can be answered by comparing the longitudinal coordinates of the
    two locations. Therefore, the question admits only one interpretation and one
    correct answer.
  - The question asks if a specific zip code in Kentucky (41240) is located east of
    a specific zip code in Florida (33756). The geographic locations of these zip

  - The question asks whether the zip code 43162 in Ohio is located east of the zip
    code 30646 in Georgia. The question can be interpreted clearly in terms of geographic
    location by comparing the longitudinal coordinates of the two zip codes. The interpretation
    focuses on geographical east-west positioning, which is a single interpretation.
    Therefore, it admits one correct answer based on geographical data.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 43162 in Ohio is located east of the zip
    code 30646 in Georgia. Zip codes are numerical identifiers that don't inherently
    provide geographical directionality such as "east" or "west." Furthermore, the
    question could be interpreted in terms of longitude (geographical east), or it
    could be interpreted in terms of ordering based on numerical values of the zip
    codes. Since the question does not specify whether it is asking about geographical
    location or numerical order, it admits more than one interpretation.
  - 'The question involves geographic locations specified by US zip codes. It asks
    whether one zip code (43162, OH) is located east of another (30646, GA). The question
    is clear because it requires a straightforward geographical analysis based on
    the relative longitudinal positions of these two zip codes. There is only one
    interpretation: determining the east-west relationship between these two specific
    locations. The correct answer can be obtained by comparing their longitudes.'
  - The question asks if a location with the zip code 43162, OH, is located east of
    another location with the zip code 30646, GA. The question is clear in its intent
    to determine the relative east-west positioning of two specific locations based
    on their zip codes. However, the primary issue arises from the fact that zip codes
    do not inherently convey longitudinal information, and geographical positioning
    would generally require specific latitude and longitude data. While one might
    attempt to deduce relative positions based on state borders or additional geographic
    information, the question itself does not provide sufficient data to definitively
    answer it. The ambiguity lies in the assumption that zip codes can directly determine
    east-west relationships without additional geographic context.
  - The question asks whether the location of the zip code 43162 in Ohio is east of
    the location of the zip code 30646 in Georgia. The question is clear in its geographic
    inquiry, asking for a straightforward comparison based on longitude. Zip codes
    are specific geographic areas, and their positions relative to each other can
    be determined using geographic data. Therefore, the question admits only one interpretation
    and has a definitive answer based on geographic coordinates.
  - The question asks whether one US zip code (43162, OH) is located east of another
    (30646, GA). While it seems straightforward, it is ambiguous due to the nature
    of geographic locations. Zip codes are primarily designed for mail delivery and
    do not strictly correspond to geographic locations. Additionally, the question
    does not specify what is meant by "located east," which could be interpreted in
    various ways such as comparing the central points of the zip codes or considering
    the entire area they cover. Furthermore, the use of state abbreviations (OH for
    Ohio and GA for Georgia) does not ensure clarity, as zip codes can span multiple
    states or regions. Thus, the question can lead to different interpretations and
    answers based on these factors.
  - The question asks if the zip code 43162 in Ohio is located east of the zip code
    30646 in Georgia. This is a geographical question that can be interpreted clearly
    by determining the longitudinal coordinates of the two locations. Ohio is generally
    north and slightly west of Georgia, and zip codes typically increase from east
    to west in the U.S. Therefore, the question has a single interpretation based
    on geographical data, specifically whether one location is east or west of the
    other. This can be answered definitively by examining a map or using geographical
    coordinates.
  - The question asks whether the location of a specific zip code in Ohio (43162)
    is east of a specific zip code in Georgia (30646). This is a straightforward geographical

    in Ohio is east of the location associated with the zip code 30646 in Georgia.
    This is a straightforward geographical query that can be resolved by comparing
    the longitudinal coordinates of the two locations. Since the question involves
    specific zip codes and the concept of 'east' as a cardinal direction, it does
    not admit multiple interpretations. Therefore, it is clear and can be answered
    definitively by determining the longitudinal positions of the two zip codes.
  - The question is asking whether one location, identified by a zip code in Ohio
    (43162), is geographically east of another location, identified by a zip code
    in Georgia (30646). The question assumes a straightforward interpretation based
    on geographical coordinates. However, the phrasing could lead to ambiguity because
    it doesn't specify whether "east" refers to longitudinal positioning or some other
    criteria. Given that zip codes are not typically used to determine precise geographical
    positions, and without explicit instructions to interpret "east" in a specific
    way, the question could lead to different interpretations. Therefore, it's not
    entirely clear-cut, and multiple interpretations regarding how to compare the
    locations could arise.

    coordinates, the interpretation of "located east" could vary slightly depending
    on how one defines the boundaries or central point of each zip code area. Furthermore,
    zip codes can sometimes cover irregular areas, which might affect the interpretation
    of "east." Nevertheless, the primary interpretation is geographical, focusing
    on longitudinal comparison, which typically admits one correct answer based on
    geographical data.

    part. The question is specifically about the eastern location of one zip code
    relative to the other. Since zip codes have specific geographical locations, this
    question has a single interpretation regarding geographical direction (east or
    west) and can be answered definitively based on geographical data. Therefore,
    the question admits one interpretation and one correct answer.
  - The question asks if one zip code in Texas (78520) is located east of another
    zip code in Texas (76020). This question seems to refer to geographical locations
    based on zip codes, which have specific coordinates. However, the ambiguity arises
    because the zip codes themselves are not inherently directional indicators, and
    without specific knowledge of their geographic positions, one might not be able
    to definitively say whether one is east of the other. Additionally, zip codes
    can sometimes represent large or irregular areas. Thus, without additional context
    or a map, the question could lead to different interpretations regarding what
    is meant by "east of" when referring to zip code areas.
  - 'The question asks if the location of the zip code 78520 in Texas is east of the
    location of the zip code 76020 in Texas. While zip codes are primarily used for
