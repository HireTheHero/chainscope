    Therefore, the question does not allow for multiple interpretations that would
    lead to different answers.'
  - The question is asking about the geographical location of two specific places
    within Brooklyn, NYC, namely PS 75 MAYDA CORTIELLA and NEW YORK CITY CHILDRENS
    CENTER. The question is straightforward in its request for a relative directional
    location (west), and it specifies the entities involved. However, the interpretation
    could vary based on the definition of "west" within the context of Brooklyn, as
    the layout of streets and neighborhoods might influence what is considered "west."
    Despite this potential complexity, the question itself is specific and factual,
    concerning the relative location of two known places, which can be objectively
    determined using a map or geographical data.
  - The question asks whether a specific school, PS 75 MAYDA CORTIELLA in Brooklyn,
    is located west of another location, NEW YORK CITY CHILDRENS CENTER in Brooklyn.
    The question is asking for a geographical relationship between two specific places.
    There is only one interpretation of this question, which is to determine the relative
    westward position of one location compared to the other. The answer would depend
    on the geographical coordinates or map data, but the question itself does not
    present multiple interpretations.
  - The question asks about the relative location of two places, PS 75 MAYDA CORTIELLA
    and NEW YORK CITY CHILDRENS CENTER, both in Brooklyn, in relation to each other.
    The question is specific about the locations involved and asks for a directional
    comparison ("west of"). This implies a straightforward geographical determination
    based on the known addresses or coordinates of the two places. There is no indication
    of multiple interpretations for what is being asked; it is a clear geographical
    inquiry that can be answered with available map data.
  - The question asks if PS 75 MAYDA CORTIELLA in Brooklyn is located west of NEW
    YORK CITY CHILDRENS CENTER, also in Brooklyn. The question is about geographical
    orientation, which typically has a clear answer if precise locations are known.
    However, without specific addresses or coordinates for these places, the interpretation
    could be ambiguous. The question assumes that the reader knows the precise locations
    of both institutions, which might not be the case. Thus, the question could lead
    to different answers depending on the interpretation or knowledge of the locations'
    positions within Brooklyn.
  - The question is asking about the relative location of two specific places in Brooklyn,
    which is part of New York City. It asks whether PS 75 MAYDA CORTIELLA is located
    west of NEW YORK CITY CHILDRENS CENTER. The question is specific about the two
    locations being compared and the direction (west) in question. Therefore, it admits
    one interpretation based on geographical coordinates or a map, leading to a single
    correct answer.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative location of two specific places in
    Brooklyn, New York City: PS 75 Mayda Cortiella and New York City Children''s Center.
    The interpretation of "west of" is straightforward as it refers to a directional
    relationship based on geographic coordinates. However, the question assumes that
    both places are well-defined and recognized locations, which they may not be.
    Without clear, authoritative geographic data or maps for these specific locations,
    the interpretation may vary based on different sources or naming conventions.
    Thus, the question could lead to different answers depending on the sources used
    to determine the locations of the two places.'

  - The question asks whether PS 75 MAYDA CORTIELLA in Brooklyn is located west of
    NEW YORK CITY CHILDRENS CENTER in Brooklyn. While the question seems straightforward,
    it assumes specific knowledge of the locations of these two places. However, the
    interpretation of "west" can vary slightly depending on the reference point or
    mapping system used. Additionally, without precise geographic coordinates or a
    detailed map, determining the exact longitudinal relationship between the two
    locations might lead to different conclusions. This ambiguity in spatial interpretation
    makes the question admit more than one interpretation.

  - 'The question asks about the relative location of two specific places in Queens,
    New York City: Beach Channel Park and Mall Eighteen. The question''s structure
    is straightforward as it seeks a geographical comparison between two fixed locations.
    Assuming these places are correctly and uniquely identified, there is only one
    factual answer regarding their relative positions on a map. Therefore, the question
    does not present multiple interpretations or ambiguity in what it is asking.'
  - The question asks whether Beach Channel Park in Queens is located west of Mall
    Eighteen in Queens. To classify this question as CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS, we need to
    consider whether the locations and directions are specified in a way that admits
    only one interpretation. The question provides two specific places in Queens and
    asks about their relative positions in terms of direction (west). However, the
    ambiguity arises because "Mall Eighteen" is not a well-known or easily identifiable
    location, leading to uncertainty about its exact position. Without a clear, universally
    recognized location for "Mall Eighteen," different interpretations or assumptions
    could lead to different answers about the relative positions of the two places.
  - The question asks whether Beach Channel Park in Queens is located west of Mall
    Eighteen in Queens. To determine if this question is clear or ambiguous, we need
    to consider the specificity of the locations and the possibility of multiple interpretations.
    If both locations are well-defined and known entities within Queens, and their
    geographical positions relative to each other can be clearly determined using
    a map or reliable geographical data, the question would be clear. However, if
    there is any uncertainty about the exact locations of these places (for example,
    if there are multiple parks or malls with similar names, or if these names are
    not widely recognized), the question could be considered ambiguous. Given that
    the question uses specific names, it assumes a level of specificity and clarity
    about the locations involved. Therefore, it can be classified as clear, provided
    the names refer to unique, identifiable locations.
  - The question asks whether Beach Channel Park in Queens is located west of Mall
    Eighteen in Queens. This question is ambiguous because it assumes that both locations
    are well-defined and known, but there might be multiple places named "Beach Channel
    Park" or "Mall Eighteen" within Queens, or there might be insufficient public
    knowledge about these specific locations to determine their relative positions.
    Without more specific information about these locations, different interpretations
    could lead to different answers.
  - The question asks about the geographical location of Beach Channel Park in relation
    to Mall Eighteen in Queens, NYC. However, it is ambiguous because there is no
    widely known or officially recognized "Mall Eighteen" in Queens. Without a clear

    regarding which location is being referred to as "Mall Eighteen." Therefore, multiple
    answers could be possible depending on what is considered "Mall Eighteen."
  - The question asks whether Beach Channel Park in Queens is located west of Mall
    Eighteen in Queens. To determine if the question is clear or ambiguous, we must
    consider if there is only one interpretation and one correct answer. The question
    seems to be asking for a geographical relationship between two specific places
    in Queens, New York City. However, the ambiguity arises because there may be multiple
    places colloquially referred to as Beach Channel Park or Mall Eighteen, and without
    additional context or specific addresses, it's not clear which exact locations
    are being referenced. This could lead to different answers depending on the interpretation
    of these place names.

    between two fixed locations. However, the ambiguity arises from the fact that
    "west" could be interpreted in different ways depending on the reference points
    or maps being used. Geographical direction might change slightly based on the
    method of interpretation (e.g., straight line on a map vs. road travel direction).
    Additionally, there is an implicit assumption about the point of reference for
    determining "west," which might not be universally agreed upon without precise
    coordinates. Thus, the interpretation of "west" can lead to different answers
    depending on the context or method used to determine the direction.
  - The question asks whether the Brooklyn Charter School in Brooklyn is located west
    of PS 527 East Side School for Social Action in Manhattan. This question is geographically

    the geographical relationship between the two schools.
  - The question asks if Brooklyn Charter School in Brooklyn is located west of PS
    527 East Side School for Social Action in Manhattan. The question is relatively
    straightforward in its intent to determine the relative geographic positions of
    two specific locations in New York City. However, the question could be considered
    ambiguous because it involves geographic locations in different boroughs (Brooklyn
    and Manhattan), which complicates a simple east-west determination due to the
    large area and irregular shape of the boroughs. Additionally, without specific
    addresses or coordinates, determining "west" could be subject to interpretation.
    However, given the broad geographic knowledge that Brooklyn is generally south
    and east of Manhattan, the question seems to seek a general understanding of relative
    positioning rather than precise geographic coordinates.

    NYC. The question is specific in its request for a directional relationship (west)
    between two fixed points. However, the ambiguity arises from the fact that "EAST
    ROCKAWAY INLET" is actually located in Nassau County, not Queens, which could
    lead to confusion. Furthermore, if the "QUEENSBORO CC MEDICAL ARTS BLDG" is not
    a well-known landmark, its location might not be readily verifiable without further
    context or information. This could result in multiple interpretations regarding
    the exact locations being referred to, making it challenging to provide a single

    about the exact locations of both the building and the inlet, especially if there
    are multiple places with similar names or if the names are not commonly known.
    Additionally, the term "west of" can be interpreted in different ways depending
    on the specific points of reference used for the locations. Therefore, without
    clear and specific geographical coordinates or widely recognized landmarks, the
    question admits more than one interpretation, which could lead to different answers
    depending on how one interprets the locations and their relative positions.

  - The question asks if the Pakistan Consulate in Manhattan is located west of a
    specific point, "14 STREET/CANARSIE TUBE, Manhattan." The main issue is the reference
    to "14 STREET/CANARSIE TUBE," which is ambiguous. "14 Street" could refer to any
    location along the length of 14th Street, which spans east to west across Manhattan.
    "Canarsie Tube" typically refers to the tunnel used by the L train, but it is
    primarily associated with Brooklyn, not Manhattan. This ambiguity in the location
    makes it difficult to determine a clear, singular location for comparison, leading
    to potential multiple interpretations of the question. Therefore, the question
    could lead to different answers depending on how one interprets "14 STREET/CANARSIE
    TUBE."
  - 'The question asks whether the Pakistan Consulate in Manhattan is located west
    of a specific location, the "14 STREET/CANARSIE TUBE, Manhattan." The phrase "14
    STREET/CANARSIE TUBE" is potentially ambiguous because it combines two different
    locations: 14th Street, which is a well-known street in Manhattan, and the Canarsie
    Tube, which is part of the subway system and typically associated with the L train
    that runs to Canarsie, Brooklyn. It is unclear whether the question refers to
    a specific intersection or a subway line, making the location ambiguous. Additionally,
    the phrase "west of" requires a precise understanding of the reference point,
    which is unclear due to the ambiguity in the location description. Therefore,
    the question admits more than one interpretation regarding the reference point
    for determining the direction.'
  - 'The question is asking if the Pakistan Consulate in Manhattan is located west
    of a specific location, 14 Street/Canarsie Tube, in Manhattan. The question is
    clear in its request for a geographical comparison between two specific points
    in Manhattan. However, there is a potential source of ambiguity: "14 STREET/CANARSIE
    TUBE, Manhattan" could refer to multiple specific locations depending on interpretation,
    such as a subway station or a general area near the Canarsie line. This could
    lead to different answers depending on which exact point is considered the reference
    location.'
  - The question is asking whether the Pakistan Consulate in Manhattan is located
    west of a specific point, 14 Street/Canarsie Tube in Manhattan. However, there
    is ambiguity in the question because "14 Street/Canarsie Tube" might refer to
    different locations. The "Canarsie Tube" is commonly associated with a subway
    line that runs under the East River, connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn, which
    does not have a specific location in Manhattan called "14 Street/Canarsie Tube."
    It might be interpreted as the L train line, which runs along 14th Street, but
    the exact reference point in Manhattan is unclear. Additionally, there could be
    multiple interpretations of where exactly on 14th Street the reference is being
    made, leading to different answers depending on the assumed location. Therefore,
    the question admits more than one interpretation due to the unclear reference
    point.
  - The question is asking about the relative location of the Pakistan Consulate in
    Manhattan in relation to the 14th Street/Canarsie Tube in Manhattan. The main
    point of ambiguity arises from the term "14 STREET/CANARSIE TUBE," which is not
    a standard or widely recognized designation for a specific location. "14th Street"
    could refer to a general area or any number of specific locations along 14th Street,
    and "Canarsie Tube" might refer to the Canarsie Line (L train) but does not specify
    a particular station or point. Without clear definitions of these locations, there
    could be multiple interpretations, leading to different answers depending on what
    specific points are being referenced.
  - The question is asking about the relative location of the Pakistan Consulate in
    Manhattan in relation to "14 STREET/CANARSIE TUBE, Manhattan." The issue arises
    with the term "14 STREET/CANARSIE TUBE," which is not a standard or well-known
    reference point in Manhattan. "14 Street" is a common street name, and "Canarsie
    Tube" could refer to a subway line or tunnel associated with the Canarsie neighborhood,
    which is actually in Brooklyn. Therefore, the question is ambiguous because it
    combines terms that do not clearly define a single, recognized location in Manhattan,
    leading to potential confusion and multiple interpretations regarding what specific
    locations are being compared.
  - The question asks whether the Pakistan Consulate in Manhattan is located west
    of a specific location referred to as "14 STREET/CANARSIE TUBE, Manhattan." However,
    there is ambiguity in the question because "14 STREET/CANARSIE TUBE" could be
    interpreted in different ways. The term "14 STREET" typically refers to a street
    in Manhattan, but "CANARSIE TUBE" usually refers to the subway line that runs
    to Canarsie in Brooklyn, not a specific location in Manhattan. This makes it unclear
    whether the question refers to a specific point on 14th Street or something else.
    Additionally, the term "west" needs a clear reference point which is not definitively
    established here, making the spatial relationship ambiguous.
  - 'The question asks about the relative location of the Pakistan Consulate in Manhattan
    in relation to "14 STREET/CANARSIE TUBE" in Manhattan. However, there is ambiguity
    in this question. "14 STREET/CANARSIE TUBE" could refer to different things: it
    could refer to the 14th Street subway station associated with the Canarsie line
    (L train), or it might refer to a specific area or landmark not widely recognized.
    Additionally, the Pakistan Consulate may not be commonly known, leading to different
    interpretations of its location without further context. The lack of specificity
    in the landmarks mentioned allows for multiple interpretations regarding the locations
    being referred to, thus leading to potential different answers depending on how
    one interprets the question.'
  - The question asks whether the Pakistan Consulate in Manhattan is located west
    of the 14 Street/Canarsie Tube in Manhattan. The locations mentioned are specific
    and geographically definable, meaning the question is asking for a straightforward
    spatial relationship between two fixed points in Manhattan. There is only one
    interpretation of the question, which is to determine the relative westward position
    of the Pakistan Consulate with respect to the 14 Street/Canarsie Tube. Thus, it
    admits one correct answer based on the actual geographic locations.
  - 'The question involves a geographical inquiry about the relative locations of
    two specific places in Manhattan: the Pakistan Consulate and 14 Street/Canarsie
    Tube. The question asks whether the Pakistan Consulate is located west of 14 Street/Canarsie
    Tube. However, there is an inherent ambiguity in the question because "14 Street/Canarsie
    Tube" may refer to a subway line (the L train, commonly known as the Canarsie
    Line) rather than a specific location. Additionally, the Canarsie Line runs east
    to west, crossing under 14th Street, making it unclear which specific point along
    this line the question refers to. Due to this ambiguity regarding the reference
    point, the question can admit multiple interpretations, leading to different answers
    depending on which part of the Canarsie Line is considered. Therefore, the question
    is classified as ambiguous.'

  - The question is asking about the geographical location of "HARLEM TEAMS FOR SELF
    HELP, Manhattan" in relation to "ST ANDREWS PLAYGROUND BASKETBALL COURT, Brooklyn."
    The main issue here is whether "HARLEM TEAMS FOR SELF HELP" is a specific, identifiable
    place that can be located on a map, and if so, whether its location can be clearly
    determined as west of "ST ANDREWS PLAYGROUND BASKETBALL COURT." Additionally,
    the question involves two different boroughs of New York City (Manhattan and Brooklyn),
    which further complicates the interpretation. Without specific addresses or more
    context, the question could be interpreted differently based on varying assumptions
    about these locations. Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation,

    FOR SELF HELP" as it is not a well-known or clearly defined place, and it is unclear
    if it refers to a specific location or organization. Furthermore, the specific
    point of reference for "west" is not defined, and the concept of being "west"
    could be interpreted differently depending on the perspective or map projection
    used. Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation, leading to

    and another in Brooklyn, which are two separate boroughs of New York City. The
    question asks if one location is west of the other, but since Manhattan and Brooklyn
    are distinct areas, the phrasing could be interpreted in different ways, leading
    to confusion about what the intended comparison is. Overall, the lack of clarity
    regarding the specific locations and the geographical comparison makes the question
    open to multiple interpretations.

    of accurate geographical data is necessary to answer the question, the interpretation
    of the question does not change.'
  - 'The question is asking about the relative location of two specific places: Harlem
    Library in Manhattan and Rafferty Triangle in Queens. The question assumes that
    there is only one Harlem Library and one Rafferty Triangle in these respective
    boroughs. However, it is ambiguous because:

    1. There could be multiple libraries in Harlem, Manhattan, and the question does
    not specify which library it refers to.

    2. Similarly, there might be multiple places that could be referred to as Rafferty
    Triangle in Queens, or there might be no officially recognized place by that name.

    3. The question does not provide sufficient context to determine which specific
    locations are meant, leading to potential multiple interpretations based on different
    assumptions about the names mentioned.


    Due to these potential ambiguities in identifying the exact locations, the question
    admits more than one interpretation and could lead to different answers depending
    on the assumptions made.'
  - The question asks whether Harlem Library in Manhattan is located west of Rafferty
    Triangle in Queens. While the question seems straightforward, the issue arises
    from the specificity of the locations. "Harlem Library, Manhattan" likely refers
    to a specific library, but there are multiple libraries in the Harlem area, such
    as the Harlem Branch Library or the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture.
    Similarly, "Rafferty Triangle, Queens" may not be a well-known or clearly defined
    location, leading to potential confusion about its exact position. Additionally,
    the question inherently involves geographical interpretation, which can vary depending
    on the precise points chosen for comparison. Therefore, the question can be seen
    as ambiguous due to the potential for multiple interpretations of the locations
    involved.

    there is only one interpretation of "west" without specifying the context or reference
    point. The term "west" in geographic terms can depend on the specific points being
    compared, and NYC's boroughs are not aligned in a perfectly straight grid. Additionally,
    without precise geographic coordinates or a map, different interpretations of
    what constitutes "west" can arise. Furthermore, there might be ambiguity regarding
    the specific locations referred to, as there might be multiple places named similarly
    or the question might be misinterpreted in terms of which Harlem Library or Rafferty
    Triangle is meant.
  - The question asks whether a specific location, the Harlem Library in Manhattan,
    is located west of another location, Rafferty Triangle in Queens. The question
    is straightforward as it involves determining the geographical position of one
    known location relative to another. However, the ambiguity arises from the fact
    that there is no widely recognized "Harlem Library" in Manhattan, leading to potential
    confusion about what specific location is being referred to. Additionally, Rafferty
    Triangle is not a well-known landmark, which could lead to different interpretations
    about its precise location. This lack of clarity about the specific locations
    makes the question ambiguous.

  - The question asks about the relative locations of "LINCOLNTON POST OFFICE" and
    "PIER 107 CVII" in Manhattan, NYC. However, it is ambiguous for a couple of reasons.
    First, "LINCOLNTON POST OFFICE" does not appear to be a well-known or easily identifiable
    location in Manhattan, raising uncertainty about its existence or the exact location.
    Similarly, "PIER 107 CVII" does not correspond to a known landmark or pier in
    Manhattan, as piers are typically numbered sequentially (e.g., Pier 17, Pier 40).
    The use of "CVII" (107 in Roman numerals) adds further confusion, as it is not
    standard nomenclature for piers in Manhattan. Without clear and verifiable locations,
    the question allows for multiple interpretations regarding the intended places,
    which could lead to different answers depending on assumptions made about these
    locations.
  - 'The question asks about the geographical relationship between two specific locations
