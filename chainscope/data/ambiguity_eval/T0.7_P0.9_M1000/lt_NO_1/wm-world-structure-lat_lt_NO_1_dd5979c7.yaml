  - The question asks about the relative location of St Andrew's House in relation
    to Balmoral Hotel, presumably both in Edinburgh, Scotland. The question is specific
    and asks for a geographical orientation, which is clear in its intent. However,
    the potential ambiguity lies in whether the question refers to cardinal directions
    (strictly south) or a more general sense of being 'south' of the hotel. Additionally,
    if there are multiple Balmoral Hotels or if the question refers to a different
    St Andrew's House outside of the context of Edinburgh, this could introduce further
    ambiguity. Without additional context, it is unclear if the question references

    of an existing station name (perhaps "Lords" or "St John''s Wood" which is near
    Lord''s Cricket Ground), or if it refers to a hypothetical or fictional station.
    Without clarification on what "Lord''s tube station" refers to, the question can
    lead to multiple interpretations and answers.'
  - The question asks whether Lord's tube station is located south of Euston St Pancras
    railway station. However, there is an ambiguity in the question because there
    is no tube station named "Lord's" in London. The closest match could be referring
    to a location near Lord's Cricket Ground, but it's not a tube station. Additionally,
    Euston and St Pancras are two separate railway stations, which adds further ambiguity.
    The lack of a clear location for "Lord's tube station" makes the question open
    to interpretation, leading to different potential answers depending on assumptions
    made.
  - The question asks about the geographical location of Lord's tube station in relation
    to Euston St Pancras railway station. However, there is ambiguity in the question
    because there is no tube station officially named "Lord's." The closest relevant
    location is St. John's Wood station, which is near Lord's Cricket Ground. Without
    a specific, recognized "Lord's tube station," the question could be interpreted
    in multiple ways, depending on what is meant by "Lord's tube station." Therefore,
    different interpretations could lead to different answers.

  - The question is asking about the relative location of Lord's tube station in relation
    to Euston St Pancras railway station. However, the ambiguity arises because there
    is no station officially named "Lord's tube station" in London. This could refer
    to a misunderstanding or a misnaming of an existing station, possibly Lord's Cricket
    Ground which is near St John's Wood station. Without a clear reference to a specific,
    existing tube station named "Lord's," the question admits multiple interpretations
    regarding what location is being referred to as "Lord's tube station." This could
    lead to different answers depending on the assumed meaning of "Lord's tube station."
  - 'The question is asking for the geographical location of Lord''s tube station
    in relation to Euston St Pancras railway station. However, there is ambiguity

    or location, such as Lord''s Cricket Ground, which does not have its own tube
    station but is near several others. Additionally, "Euston St Pancras railway station"
    seems to conflate two separate stations: Euston Station and St Pancras Station.
    This could lead to confusion about which station the question refers to. Therefore,
    the question admits more than one interpretation due to these ambiguities.'
  - The question asks about the relative location of Lord's tube station and Euston
    St Pancras railway station. However, there is ambiguity because "Lord's tube station"
    does not exist. The mention of "Lord's" could be a reference to a nearby landmark
    such as Lord's Cricket Ground, but it is not clear what is meant by "Lord's tube
    station." Furthermore, Euston and St Pancras are separate railway stations, which
    adds another layer of ambiguity regarding the reference point. These ambiguities
    lead to multiple possible interpretations and answers.
  - The question asks whether Lord's tube station is located south of Euston St Pancras
    railway station. The ambiguity arises because there is no station officially named
    "Lord's tube station" in the London Underground system. This could refer to the
    area near Lord's Cricket Ground, which is served by St John's Wood station, but
    without a clear reference, the question is open to interpretation. Therefore,
    the question can lead to different interpretations and answers based on what "Lord's
    tube station" is understood to mean.
  - The question is asking about the geographical location of Lord's tube station
    in relation to Euston St Pancras railway station. However, there are a few points
    that contribute to the ambiguity. Firstly, there is no station officially named
    "Lord's tube station," which raises questions about what the question refers to.
    It could be a misunderstanding or a nickname for a nearby station. Secondly, Euston
    and St Pancras are two separate railway stations, though they are close to each
    other, which could lead to confusion about which station the question is specifically
    referring to. The unclear reference to "Lord's tube station" and the dual mention
    of Euston and St Pancras contribute to multiple possible interpretations and potential
    answers.
  - The question asks whether Lord's tube station is located south of Euston St Pancras
    railway station. However, there is ambiguity because there is no "Lord's tube

    Ground, which is near St John's Wood station, or another location. Additionally,
    Euston and St Pancras are separate railway stations, though they are close to
    each other. The question could be asking about the relative location of a non-existent
    station to two closely situated stations, which leads to multiple interpretations.

    about whether Masmak Fort is located south of Fateh Sagar Lake. There is only
    one correct interpretation and one correct answer to this question based on geographical
    facts.
  - The question asks about the location of Masmak Fort in relation to Fateh Sagar
    Lake. The question assumes that both landmarks are well-known and identifiable,
    which may not be the case for everyone. Additionally, the question could be interpreted
    in different ways depending on whether the person answering knows the locations
    of both the fort and the lake. Furthermore, Masmak Fort is located in Riyadh,
    Saudi Arabia, while Fateh Sagar Lake is in Udaipur, India, making them unrelated
    geographically. This geographic discrepancy could lead to confusion or misinterpretation
    of the question, as the two landmarks are not commonly associated with each other.
  - 'The question asks if Masmak Fort is located south of Fateh Sagar Lake. This is
    a geographical question that can be answered by verifying the locations of Masmak
    Fort and Fateh Sagar Lake. Masmak Fort is in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, while Fateh

    regarding whether Masmak Fort is located south of Fateh Sagar Lake. The interpretation
    does not vary, and there is a definitive answer based on geographical facts.
  - 'The question is asking about the location of Masmak Fort in relation to Fateh
    Sagar Lake. However, the question is ambiguous because it involves two separate
    geographic locations: Masmak Fort is in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and Fateh Sagar
    Lake is in Udaipur, India. These locations are in different countries, making
    the question inherently unclear or incorrect as a geographic comparison. The phrasing
    suggests a proximity that does not exist, leading to multiple interpretations
    about the intent or understanding of the locations involved.'
  - 'The question asks about the geographical location of Masmak Fort in relation
    to Fateh Sagar Lake. To classify it, we need to determine if the question can
    have multiple interpretations or if it seeks a single factual answer. The question
    involves two specific landmarks: Masmak Fort and Fateh Sagar Lake. However, these
    two are located in entirely different countries; Masmak Fort is in Riyadh, Saudi
    Arabia, while Fateh Sagar Lake is in Udaipur, India. Given the distinct locations
    of these landmarks, the question cannot be interpreted in multiple ways, as there
    is only one possible factual relationship between them (they are not in proximity
    to each other). Therefore, the question is clear in seeking a straightforward
    yes or no answer based on factual geographical information.'
  - The question asks about the location of Masmak Fort in relation to Fateh Sagar
    Lake. This question is AMBIGUOUS because it assumes a connection between the two
    locations without considering that they might be in completely different geographical
    areas. Masmak Fort is in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and Fateh Sagar Lake is in Udaipur,
    India. The question's phrasing could lead to confusion since the locations are
    unrelated, and the interpretation of "south" could be literal or metaphorical,
    neither of which would be accurate given the geographical distance and context.
  - The question asks about the geographical location of Masmak Fort in relation to
    Fateh Sagar Lake. This question is clear and straightforward as it seeks a specific
    factual answer regarding the relative location of two distinct landmarks. It does
    not present multiple interpretations since it solely focuses on the directional
    relationship between Masmak Fort and Fateh Sagar Lake.
  - The question asks about the location of Masmak Fort in relation to Fateh Sagar
    Lake. This is a straightforward geographical question that seeks a specific answer
    based on the relative positions of two landmarks. There is only one correct interpretation,
    which involves checking the geographical locations of Masmak Fort and Fateh Sagar
    Lake to determine if Masmak Fort is indeed located south of the lake. Therefore,
    the question is clear in what it is asking.
  - The question asks if Masmak Fort is located south of Fateh Sagar Lake. This question
    is geographically based and seeks to establish a specific directional relationship
    between two locations. However, Masmak Fort is located in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia,
    while Fateh Sagar Lake is in Udaipur, India. Given the vast distance between the
    two, the interpretation of the question might be about their relative positions
    on a world map. However, since the question is straightforward in asking about
    the relative location of two specific places, it admits only one interpretation
    and one correct answer, which is "No, Masmak Fort is not located south of Fateh
    Sagar Lake." Thus, the question is not ambiguous in its interpretation.

  - The question is about the location of Thomson Dam relative to the Monash Freeway.
    The question is straightforward and asks for a geographical relationship. However,
    without specifying which Thomson Dam (as there could be multiple with that name)
    or which Monash Freeway (as there might be more than one, though less likely),
    the question could have multiple interpretations. Therefore, it could lead to
    different answers depending on the specific locations being referenced.
  - The question asks about the geographical location of Thomson Dam in relation to
    Monash Freeway. The question is ambiguous because there could be multiple structures
    with similar names in different regions, and without specifying a particular region
    or providing additional context, it is unclear which Thomson Dam or Monash Freeway
    is being referred to. Therefore, the interpretation could vary depending on the
    assumed locations of these landmarks.
  - The question asks about the geographical location of Thomson Dam in relation to
    Monash Freeway. The interpretation of the question hinges on having precise knowledge
    about the specific geographical locations of the Thomson Dam and the Monash Freeway.
    However, the question itself is straightforward and does not present multiple
    interpretations. It seeks a specific directional relationship between two geographical
    landmarks, which can be definitively answered with geographical data. Therefore,
    the question is considered to be clear in its intent.
  - The question asks about the location of the Thomson Dam in relation to the Monash
    Freeway. However, it does not specify which Thomson Dam it is referring to, as
    there could be multiple dams with similar names in different regions. Additionally,
    the Monash Freeway is a specific location, but without further context about the
    region or country, the question could be interpreted in multiple ways. This ambiguity
    in both the subject and the reference point makes the question open to different
    interpretations.
  - 'The question "Is Thomson Dam located south of Monash Freeway?" is asking about
    the geographical relationship between two specific locations: Thomson Dam and
    Monash Freeway. The question can be interpreted in only one way, as it seeks to
    determine if one specific location is south of another specific location. Therefore,
    it only admits one interpretation and one correct answer based on their actual
    geographical positions.'
  - The question asks about the location of Thomson Dam in relation to Monash Freeway.
    While this might seem straightforward, it is ambiguous because there is no widely
    known "Thomson Dam" that is commonly recognized in relation to the "Monash Freeway."
    There could be multiple dams with similar names, or it could be a lesser-known
    local feature, making it difficult to determine the exact location without further
    context. Additionally, without specifying the country or region, it's unclear
    which Thomson Dam or Monash Freeway is being referred to. These factors contribute
    to multiple possible interpretations and answers.
  - The question "Is Thomson Dam located south of Monash Freeway?" is AMBIGUOUS because
    it assumes a specific interpretation of geographic locations without providing
    sufficient context. The Monash Freeway is a specific roadway in Victoria, Australia,
    but the question does not specify which part of the freeway or which Thomson Dam
    it refers to, as there might be multiple dams with the same name in different
    locations. Additionally, without a clear reference point or map coordinates, the
    answer could vary depending on the specific sections of the freeway and the dam
    in question.
  - The question asks if Thomson Dam is located south of Monash Freeway. The question
    could be interpreted in more than one way because it does not specify which Monash
    Freeway it refers to, as there may be different segments or locations named Monash
    Freeway. Additionally, without a specific reference to a map or additional context
    about what is meant by "south," the question could lead to different interpretations
    and answers based on geographical perspective or the segment of the freeway in
    question.
  - The question asks about the location of Thomson Dam in relation to the Monash
    Freeway. However, it lacks specificity about which Thomson Dam is being referred
    to, as there might be multiple structures with similar names in different parts
    of the world. Additionally, the Monash Freeway is a specific freeway located in
    Melbourne, Australia, but without explicit context, the interpretation could vary.
    These factors make the question potentially open to multiple interpretations.
  - The question "Is Thomson Dam located south of Monash Freeway?" is asking about
    the geographical location of Thomson Dam in relation to Monash Freeway. This question
    appears to be straightforward, asking for a specific directional relationship
    between two fixed points. However, without further context, there could be potential
    ambiguity. Thomson Dam could refer to different dams (if there are multiple with
    similar names), and Monash Freeway could also have different segments or interpretations
    of what "south" means relative to the entire freeway. If we assume there is only
    one Thomson Dam and one Monash Freeway, the question would be clear. However,
    due to the potential for multiple interpretations, it introduces ambiguity.

  - The question asks about the relative location of Pearl Palace in relation to Hotel
    Continental in Tangier. This seems to be a straightforward geographical question.
    However, without additional context or a specific map reference, it could be ambiguous
    because "Pearl Palace" might refer to more than one location or it might not be
    a well-known landmark, leading to different interpretations of which "Pearl Palace"
    is being referred to. The question assumes a specific Pearl Palace, but without
    clarification, it could lead to multiple interpretations.
  - The question is asking about the relative location of the Pearl Palace in relation
    to the Hotel Continental in Tangier. It appears to be a straightforward geographical
    question, assuming that both the Pearl Palace and the Hotel Continental in Tangier

    that could be located relative to Hotel Continental. This lack of specificity
    leads to potential interpretations and assumptions, such as whether Pearl Palace
    is a well-known landmark or a lesser-known entity, and if there are multiple locations
    with the same name. Therefore, the question could lead to different answers depending
    on the assumed context or additional information provided.

    information. However, the ambiguity arises from the fact that Abuna Yemata Guh
    is in Ethiopia, and Chaeng Watthana Government Complex is in Thailand, making
    a direct north-south comparison geographically nonsensical since they are in different
    countries and very far apart. The question might be interpreted as asking for
    a comparison within a local context or involving some other interpretation of
    "south," but as it stands, the geographical distance makes the question not applicable
    in a straightforward manner. Therefore, the question is ambiguous due to its confusing

    based on geographical facts, but the inclusion of two unrelated locations makes
    it nonsensical and possibly reflects a misunderstanding or error. Despite this,
    the question does not present multiple interpretations; it simply contains an
    inaccurate premise. Therefore, it can be interpreted as seeking a factual answer
    based on the erroneous premise.'
  - The question asks about the relative location of Lake Lawtonka in relation to
    Paphos Castle. The question is clear and specific, as it seeks to determine whether
    Lake Lawtonka is situated to the south of Paphos Castle. However, the question

  - The question asks about the location of USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77) in relation to
    Hvalsey Church. The specific ship, USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77), is a historical vessel
    that was active during World War II and sank in 1943. Therefore, it no longer
    has a current location. Hvalsey Church is a well-defined location in Greenland.
    The question could be interpreted in terms of historical location or current relics,
    leading to potential ambiguity about whether it refers to the ship's last known
    location, a memorial, or something else. Additionally, the question does not specify
    a timeframe, which adds to the ambiguity.
  - The question asks whether the USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77) is located south of Hvalsey
    Church. The USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77) was a United States Coast Guard cutter that
    was sunk during World War II, so its current location is not a matter of geographical
    positioning but historical record. The question could be interpreted as asking
    about the ship's historical position before it sank, or it could be interpreted
    as a misunderstanding, thinking the ship is still afloat and positioned somewhere.
    Furthermore, Hvalsey Church is a ruin in Greenland, adding another layer of potential
    misunderstanding regarding the context of the question. These factors contribute
    to multiple interpretations of the question, leading to different possible answers.
  - The question asks if the USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77) is located south of Hvalsey Church.
    The USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77) was a ship that served during World War II and was
    sunk in 1943. Hvalsey Church is a historical site in Greenland. The question can
    be interpreted as asking about the current or historical location of the ship
    relative to the church. Since the ship no longer exists, it cannot currently be
    located in relation to the church. This could lead to different interpretations
    and answers regarding the time frame or context of the question (historical location
    before sinking or current theoretical location). Therefore, the question admits
    more than one interpretation.
  - The question is asking about the relative location of a specific ship, the USCGC
    Escanaba (WPG-77), in relation to Hvalsey Church. However, the question does not
    specify a time frame or context in which the ship's location should be considered,
    such as whether it is referring to historical data or a current position. Ships
    can move, and the USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77) was a ship that served during World
    War II, so it no longer exists in an operational sense today. This lack of context
    creates ambiguity because the answer could vary depending on the time or context
    considered. Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation, which
    could lead to different answers.
  - "The question asks about the location of the USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77) in relation\
    \ to Hvalsey Church. The USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77) was a ship that served during\
    \ World War II, and it was sunk in 1943. Hvalsey Church is a historical site located\
    \ in Greenland. The question could be interpreted in two ways: \n1. It might be\
    \ asking about the historical location of the ship's wreck relative to the church,\
    \ which would require historical and geographical knowledge of the ship's sinking\
    \ location.\n2. It could be asking about any current location or memorial related\
    \ to the ship, which might be more complex given the ship is no longer operational.\n\
    \nGiven these potential interpretations, the question admits more than one interpretation\
    \ and could lead to different answers depending on the context considered (historical\
    \ or present-day). Therefore, the question is ambiguous."
  - The question asks whether the USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77) is located south of Hvalsey
    Church. This question can be interpreted in more than one way because it does
    not specify a particular point in time. The USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77) was a Coast
    Guard Cutter that served during World War II and was sunk in 1943. Therefore,
    its current "location" could be interpreted as its last known position, which
    could be south of Hvalsey Church. Alternatively, the question could be interpreted
    as asking about the ship's location during its operational period. Without a specific
    timeframe, the question remains ambiguous. Additionally, the question could also
    be interpreted as asking about a memorial or artifact related to the ship that
    might be located south of Hvalsey Church, further adding to the ambiguity.
  - The question asks if the USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77) is located south of Hvalsey Church.
    This question can be considered AMBIGUOUS because it involves multiple interpretations
    and assumptions. First, the USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77) was a ship that was sunk during
    World War II, so it no longer has a current location. Secondly, even if the question
    refers to the last known location of the wreck, it would require specific historical
    and geographical knowledge to determine its position relative to Hvalsey Church.
    Without clear temporal or contextual parameters, such as whether the question
    is about the ship's last known operational position or its wreck site, different
    interpretations and answers could arise.
  - The question is asking about the location of the USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77) relative
    to Hvalsey Church. The USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77) is a ship that was in service during
    World War II and was sunk in 1943. Hvalsey Church is located in Greenland. Since
    the ship is no longer in existence, the question cannot be answered in a straightforward
    manner based on current location or orientation. Additionally, the question does
    not specify a particular time frame or context in which the ship might have been
    located south of Hvalsey Church, leading to multiple interpretations about what
    is being asked. Therefore, the question is ambiguous.
  - 'The question asks if the USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77) is located south of Hvalsey
    Church. The question implies a comparison of two locations: the current or final
    position of the USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77) and Hvalsey Church. However, USCGC Escanaba
    (WPG-77) was a United States Coast Guard Cutter that sank in 1943, and Hvalsey
    Church is a historical ruin in Greenland. Since the ship no longer exists, the
    question could be interpreted in a historical context (e.g., where it was at a
    certain point in time) or in a metaphorical sense (e.g., its resting place relative
    to the church). Additionally, without specifying a time frame or whether it refers
    to the wreck''s location, the question admits multiple interpretations, leading
    to different answers based on the context considered.'
  - The question is asking about the geographical location of the USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77)
    in relation to Hvalsey Church. However, it is ambiguous because it does not specify
    whether it is referring to a particular point in time or a specific context (e.g.,
    historical location, current location, or fictional scenario). Additionally, the
    USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77) is a ship that was sunk during World War II, so its current
    location is not applicable in a straightforward manner. Thus, the question could
    be interpreted in different ways depending on the context, leading to different
    answers.

  - The question asks whether the Fitzroy Tavern is located south of Burdett Road
    railway station. This appears to be a straightforward geographical question, assuming
    that both the Fitzroy Tavern and Burdett Road railway station are distinct, known
    locations. However, without specifying the city or context (e.g., London, where
    both locations might exist), the question could be interpreted differently depending
    on the geographical area being referred to. If the question is intended to refer
    to London, it would be clearer, but as it stands, it could be interpreted to apply
    to multiple places worldwide that might have similarly named locations.
  - The question asks whether the Fitzroy Tavern is located south of the Burdett Road
    railway station. This question is geographically specific and only has one interpretation
    regarding the relative location of these two places. The answer depends on the
    actual geographic locations of the Fitzroy Tavern and the Burdett Road railway
    station, which can be verified with a map or geographic data.
  - The question asks about the location of Fitzroy Tavern in relation to Burdett
    Road railway station. However, the question is ambiguous because there is no universally
    recognized location for a "Burdett Road railway station," and Fitzroy Tavern could
    refer to multiple locations. Without specific geographic identifiers or context,
    the question can be interpreted in multiple ways, leading to different answers
    depending on which locations are being considered.
  - The question asks whether Fitzroy Tavern is located south of Burdett Road railway
    station. For this question to be classified as CLEAR, the locations of both Fitzroy
    Tavern and Burdett Road railway station must be well-defined and known, allowing
    for a straightforward determination of their relative positions. However, there
    may be ambiguity due to the existence of multiple places with similar names or
    a lack of specificity in identifying the exact locations being referred to. Without
    additional context to confirm the exact locations, the question can be interpreted
    in more than one way, leading to different answers.
  - The question asks about the geographical location of Fitzroy Tavern in relation
    to Burdett Road railway station. It appears to require a straightforward answer
    based on geographical data. However, the ambiguity arises because there could
    be multiple places named Fitzroy Tavern or Burdett Road railway station in different
    parts of the world. Without specifying the city or country, the question can have
    multiple interpretations, each leading to a different answer.
  - The question is asking about the geographical location of Fitzroy Tavern in relation
    to Burdett Road railway station. To classify this question, we need to determine
    if the terms used are specific and unambiguous. "Fitzroy Tavern" is a specific
    place, but there might be multiple places with similar names around the world.
    "Burdett Road railway station" could also refer to different stations if not specified
    by city or country, and if it doesn't exist, it adds ambiguity. Without clear
    context or specific locations, the question can be interpreted in different ways
    depending on which Fitzroy Tavern or Burdett Road station is being referred to.
  - 'The question is asking about the geographical relationship between two specific
    locations: Fitzroy Tavern and Burdett Road railway station. To determine whether
    the question is clear or ambiguous, one must consider whether the locations are
    well-defined and whether there is only one possible interpretation of the geographic
    relationship being asked about.


    Fitzroy Tavern is a well-known pub in London, specifically located in the Fitzrovia
    area. Burdett Road railway station, however, does not exist as a current railway
    station; it may refer to a historical or fictional location, or it may be confused
    with a similar name. The lack of a clear, existing location for Burdett Road railway
    station introduces ambiguity, as it is unclear what specific location the question
    refers to.


    Additionally, without a specific and known location for Burdett Road railway station,
    the question about whether Fitzroy Tavern is located south of it cannot be definitively
    answered. This ambiguity in the reference to Burdett Road railway station leads
    to multiple interpretations and potential answers.


    Therefore, the question is ambiguous because it relies on an unclear and potentially
    non-existent location, leading to different possible interpretations.'

    definitively with geographical data, which would provide one correct answer.'
  - The question asks whether the Warner Grand Theatre is located south of the McCallum
    Theatre. While the question appears to be straightforward, it could be considered
    ambiguous due to the lack of specific context or reference points. The interpretation
    of "south" could vary depending on the specific locations or reference points
    being used. Additionally, without specific geographical data or a defined map
    reference, multiple interpretations of "south" could arise based on different
    perspectives or scales (e.g., city, county, state). Therefore, the question could
    lead to different answers depending on these factors.
  - The question is asking about the geographical location of Warner Grand Theatre
    in relation to McCallum Theatre. This question is specific and seeks a factual
    answer based on the relative positions of the two theaters. However, it does not
    specify which McCallum Theatre it is referring to, as there might be multiple
    theaters with similar names in different locations. This lack of specificity makes
    the question open to interpretation depending on which McCallum Theatre is being
    considered.
  - The question asks if Warner Grand Theatre is located south of McCallum Theatre.
    The question is geographically specific and requires knowledge of the locations
    of these two theatres. However, the question assumes the reader knows the exact
    locations of both theatres without providing any additional context or reference
    points. The ambiguity arises because without specific geographical data, or if
    either theatre has more than one location, there could be multiple interpretations
    of where "south" is in relation to the other. Additionally, without further context,
    it is unclear if the question refers to a specific point in time or if any changes
    in location over time are relevant.
  - 'The question is asking for a directional relationship between two specific locations:
    Warner Grand Theatre and McCallum Theatre. While the question seems straightforward,
    it may be considered ambiguous due to the lack of specific reference points or
    clarification on whether "south" is meant in a general sense or relative to a
    specific map projection. The interpretation of "south" could vary depending on
    the context or the map being used, leading to potential differences in answers.
    However, typically, such questions are treated as clear when referring to standard
    geographical directions. Despite this, the potential for different interpretations
    based on varying contexts or map projections makes this question more ambiguous.'
  - The question asks whether the Warner Grand Theatre is located south of McCallum
    Theatre. It is clear in its request for a geographical comparison between two
    specific locations. However, it does not provide the necessary context, such as
    the specific cities or regions these theaters are located in, which could affect
    the interpretation of "south." Without this additional context, one cannot definitively
    determine the direction relative to each other. Therefore, the question could
    admit more than one interpretation depending on the assumed location of these
    theaters.
  - 'The question asks about the relative location of two theaters: Warner Grand Theatre
    and McCallum Theatre. To classify this as CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS, we need to consider

    can be answered with geographical data. However, one potential source of ambiguity
    is the interpretation of "Hamilton Palace," which no longer exists as it was demolished
    in the 1920s. The site where Hamilton Palace once stood is known, so if we interpret
    the question as asking about the location relative to the historical site of Hamilton
    Palace, the question becomes clear. Therefore, while there could be a slight ambiguity
    regarding the interpretation of "Hamilton Palace," given the historical context,
    the primary interpretation remains consistent and clear.
  - The question asks whether Motherwell Cathedral is located south of Hamilton Palace.
    It seems straightforward, asking for a specific directional relationship between

    information about which Hamilton Palace is being referred to, as there could be
    more than one place or structure known by that name, especially in different regions
    or historical contexts. Without specifying the location of Hamilton Palace, the
    question becomes ambiguous because the answer could vary based on the interpretation
    of which Hamilton Palace is being considered.
  - 'The question "Is Motherwell Cathedral located south of Hamilton Palace?" appears
    to be seeking a straightforward geographical relationship between two specific

    for ambiguity because "Hamilton Palace" could refer to a historical building that
    was demolished in the 1920s, or it could be mistakenly interpreted as referring
    to another location with a similar name. Furthermore, without specifying which
    "Motherwell Cathedral" is being referenced (assuming there might be more than
    one with similar names globally), there is room for multiple interpretations.
    Therefore, due to the lack of specificity and potential for different interpretations,
    this question is classified as ambiguous.'

    Dam is located in California, USA, and St. John the Baptist Cathedral is in Santorini,
    Greece. Given these known locations, there is only one correct geographical relationship
    between them. Therefore, the question does not admit more than one interpretation
    regarding the relative positions of these two landmarks.
  - The question asks about the relative location of the San Clemente Dam and St.
    John the Baptist Cathedral in Santorini. However, it presents ambiguity because
    there is no widely recognized structure known as the "San Clemente Dam" in relation

    The San Clemente Dam is actually located in California, USA, and not near Santorini,
    Greece. The question could be interpreted in multiple ways, such as a hypothetical
    or fictional scenario, or it could be a misunderstanding of geographical locations,
    leading to different possible answers based on these interpretations.
  - "The question asks whether the San Clemente Dam is located south of St. John the\
    \ Baptist Cathedral in Santorini. This question is ambiguous for several reasons:\
    \ \n1. \"San Clemente Dam\" could refer to different places if there are multiple\
    \ dams with similar names, though it most commonly refers to the one in California.\n\
    2. \"St. John the Baptist Cathedral\" is specified to be in Santorini, but there\
    \ could be confusion if there are multiple cathedrals with similar names in different\
    \ locations.\n3. The question assumes a specific geographical orientation without\
    \ providing clear reference points or maps, which could lead to different interpretations\
    \ of what \"south\" means in this context.\nDue to these ambiguities, the question\
    \ could be interpreted in different ways depending on the geographical and contextual\
    \ understanding of the locations involved."
  - The question asks about the relative locations of the San Clemente Dam and St.
    John the Baptist Cathedral in Santorini. However, there is an inherent ambiguity
    because the San Clemente Dam is located in California, USA, and Santorini is in
    Greece. The question seems to compare two unrelated geographical locations, which
    could lead to confusion. The interpretation of "south of" is clear in a geographical
    sense, but the inclusion of these two specific and unrelated places makes the
    overall question ambiguous.
  - "The question is asking about the relative location of the San Clemente Dam and\
    \ St. John the Baptist Cathedral in Santorini. However, the question is ambiguous\
    \ for a couple of reasons: \n1. There is no well-known \"San Clemente Dam\" associated\
    \ with Santorini or any nearby locations. The San Clemente Dam is actually located\
    \ in California, USA.\n2. The question doesn't specify which direction is considered\
    \ \"south\" since directions could be interpreted differently depending on the\
    \ frame of reference.\n\nDue to these ambiguities, the question could be interpreted\
    \ in multiple ways, leading to different answers depending on assumptions made\

  - 'The question asks about the relative location of two structures: San Clemente
    Dam and St. John the Baptist Cathedral, Santorini. However, there are multiple
    interpretations possible due to the ambiguous nature of the question. First, "San
    Clemente Dam" refers to a dam that was located in California, USA. On the other
    hand, "St. John the Baptist Cathedral" in Santorini refers to a cathedral in Greece.
    The question asks if the dam is located south of the cathedral. Given the significant
    geographical distance and lack of direct relevance between these two locations,
    the question is not straightforward. Additionally, without specifying which "San
    Clemente Dam" (if there''s more than one by name) or confirming its current status
    (as it has been dismantled), the question can lead to different answers. Therefore,
    the question admits more than one interpretation, which could lead to different
    answers.'

    could be interpreted based on different reference points or maps. This could potentially
    lead to varying answers depending on the interpretation of "south." Therefore,
    the question could be considered ambiguous due to the lack of precise geographic
    context or reference points.
  - The question "Is Thevally Palace located south of British Residency?" is asking
    about the relative geographical position of two specific landmarks. The interpretation
    hinges on the geographical coordinates or well-known location details of Thevally
    Palace and British Residency. Without additional context about which specific
    British Residency is being referred to, there could be multiple interpretations
    depending on the geographical region in question, as there might be several places
    known as British Residency in different parts of the world. Thus, the question
    can lead to different answers based on the assumed context or location of the
    British Residency in question.
  - The question asks about the relative location of Thevally Palace in relation to
    the British Residency. While the question seems straightforward, the ambiguity
    arises from not specifying which British Residency is being referred to, as there
    could be multiple sites with similar names in different locations around the world.
    Without a specific context or location, the question can be interpreted in multiple
    ways, leading to different potential answers based on different British Residency
    locations.
  - The question asks about the relative location of Thevally Palace with respect
    to the British Residency. It is clear in its request for geographic information
    and does not present multiple interpretations. The question can be answered with
    a straightforward "yes" or "no" based on the actual locations of the two landmarks.
    Therefore, it admits one interpretation and one correct answer.

  - 'The question asks whether the Cathedral Church of St. Luke in Orlando, Florida,
    is located south of Jahanpanah. This question is geographically specific and involves
    comparing the latitudinal positions of two places: the Cathedral Church of St.
    Luke in Orlando, Florida, and Jahanpanah, which is a historical city in India.
    Since geographic coordinates are well-defined and there is only one correct interpretation
    of what it means for one location to be south of another (i.e., having a lower
    latitude), the question is clear and admits only one correct answer based on the
    geographic positions of the two locations.'
  - The question asks whether the Cathedral Church of St. Luke in Orlando, Florida,
    is located south of Jahanpanah. This question is geographically clear because
    it involves determining the relative positions of two specific locations on the
    globe. The Cathedral Church of St. Luke has a fixed location in Orlando, Florida,
    in the United States, and Jahanpanah is a historical city area in Delhi, India.
    By examining their latitudes, one can determine whether the former is south of
    the latter. There is only one correct geographical interpretation and answer to
    this question.
  - 'The question asks about the relative location of two specific places: the Cathedral
    Church of St. Luke in Orlando, Florida, and Jahanpanah. The interpretation of
    this question hinges on the identification of "Jahanpanah," which could refer
    to a historic city area in Delhi, India. Given that Orlando, Florida is located
    in the northern hemisphere and generally north of Delhi, the question seems to
    ask if the church is geographically south of Jahanpanah. However, if "Jahanpanah"
    were to refer to any other location with a similar name or context, the question
    could lead to different interpretations and answers. Therefore, due to the potential

    in one way: determining the cardinal direction of one location relative to the
    other, which would typically involve using a map or geographical knowledge. The
    question is straightforward in asking for a simple directional relationship between
    two specific places.'
  - 'The question asks if the Cathedral Church of St. Luke in Orlando, Florida, is

    the other. Since Orlando, Florida, is in the United States, and Jahanpanah is
    a historical city in India, it is clear that Orlando is geographically south of
    Jahanpanah. Thus, the question has a single interpretation and a single correct
    answer.'
