  - The question asks whether a specific zip code in Indiana (47274) is located south
    of another specific zip code in Maryland (20737). The question assumes that zip
    codes can be compared in terms of geographic direction (north-south), which is
    generally possible by comparing their latitudinal coordinates. Given the specific
    zip codes and states mentioned, the question has a single interpretation regarding
    geographic location comparison. Therefore, it is clear in its intent to compare
    the relative north-south position of these two locations.
  - The question asks whether one specific location (associated with the zip code
    47274 in Indiana) is located south of another location (associated with the zip
    code 20737 in Maryland). The interpretation of "south" in this context is straightforward,
    referring to the geographical position relative to a cardinal direction. However,
    the question does not specify whether it is asking for the geographical center
    of the zip code area or a specific point within it. Despite this, the general
    interpretation of comparing the latitude of the central points of the zip code
    areas can be considered. Therefore, the question admits one primary interpretation
    regarding geographical positioning, even though it could theoretically be more
    precise about what aspect of the zip codes' locations it is comparing.
  - The question asks whether a specific zip code in Indiana (47274) is located south
    of a zip code in Maryland (20737). This is a straightforward geographical question
    that involves determining the relative north-south position of two fixed locations
    based on their geographical coordinates (latitude). The zip codes are unique identifiers
    for specific locations, and their geographical positions can be precisely determined.
    There is only one correct interpretation of the question, which is to compare
    the latitudes of the two locations to determine which one is further south.
  - The question asks whether the location of the zip code 47274 in Indiana is south
    of the zip code 20737 in Maryland. The interpretation of "south" in this context
    is geographical. This is a clear geographical inquiry that only admits one interpretation
    and can be answered by comparing the latitudinal positions of the two zip codes.
    Therefore, the question is straightforward and does not admit multiple interpretations.
  - The question asks whether the location of the zip code 47274 in Indiana is south
    of the location of the zip code 20737 in Maryland. The question is clear in that
    it seeks a geographical comparison between two specific zip codes. Zip codes have
    fixed locations, so determining whether one is south of the other is a straightforward
    task based on their geographical coordinates. Thus, the question is not open to
    multiple interpretations and has a single correct answer based on geographic data.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographical location of two zip codes:
    47274 in Indiana (IN) and 20737 in Maryland (MD). The question is straightforward
    in that it seeks to determine if one location is south of the other. However,
    it is ambiguous because zip codes do not inherently provide precise geographical
    coordinates, and the layout of zip codes is not necessarily linear or orderly
    in terms of north-south orientation. Furthermore, the question could be interpreted
    as asking whether the entirety of one zip code area is south of the entirety of
    the other, which could lead to different interpretations based on specific points
    or boundaries within those zip codes.'
  - The question is asking if the location associated with the zip code 47274 in Indiana
    is south of the location associated with the zip code 20737 in Maryland. This
    is a straightforward geographical question that involves comparing the latitudinal
    positions of two specific points, each defined by a unique zip code. There is
    only one interpretation of the question, which is to determine the relative north-south
    position of the two locations based on their zip codes. Therefore, the question
    admits only one correct answer based on geographical data.
  - The question asks about the geographical location of two US zip codes, specifically
    whether one is located south of the other. US zip codes are numerical and assigned
    in a manner that does not directly correlate with geographic latitude or longitude.
    Therefore, interpreting the question solely based on the numerical values of the
    zip codes is not possible. Instead, one must interpret the question in terms of
    the actual geographic locations of the areas represented by these zip codes. Upon
    such an interpretation, the question can be answered by determining if Seymour,
    IN (47274) is south of Riverdale, MD (20737) based on latitude. However, the question
    could also be interpreted as asking about something else entirely, such as a comparison
    of the numbers themselves if taken out of context. This allows for more than one
    interpretation and potentially different answers based on how one chooses to approach
    the question.
  - The question is asking whether the zip code 47274, which is in Indiana (IN), is
    located south of the zip code 20737, which is in Maryland (MD). This can be interpreted
    as a straightforward geographical query comparing the relative positions of two
    specific locations based on their latitude. Since zip codes are fixed and their
    geographical positions can be determined, the question admits only one interpretation
    and one correct answer based on geographical data.
  - The question is asking whether a specific zip code in Indiana (47274) is located
    south of a specific zip code in Maryland (20737). Zip codes are numerical codes
    used for postal purposes and do not inherently provide information about geographic
    location. While it might be possible to find the geographic coordinates of these
    zip codes, the question does not specify whether it is asking for a direct southward
    line on a map, a postal routing south, or some other interpretation of "south."
    Thus, without additional context, the question is open to multiple interpretations
    regarding what "south" means in this context.
  00c26c8efc56e8cff279d7dbe09ec3bca0e46bdde7ad47a51b09410d56a8d339:
  - The question involves determining the geographical location of two U.S. zip codes
    and comparing their relative positions. The zip codes 36830 and 75693 correspond
    to locations in Alabama and Texas, respectively. The question is asking if the
    first zip code is located south of the second zip code. This is a straightforward
    geographical comparison that can be answered by checking the latitude of each
    location. Since there is only one way to interpret "south of" in terms of geography,
    the question is clear and admits only one correct answer based on geographical
    data.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 36830, located in Alabama (AL), is south
    of the zip code 75693, located in Texas (TX). This question is clear because it
    has a specific geographic interpretation based on the latitude of these zip codes.
    The interpretation involves comparing the latitude of the two locations to determine
    which one is further south. As such, it admits only one correct answer based on
    geographical data.
  - The question asks whether a specific zip code in Alabama (36830) is located south
    of a specific zip code in Texas (75693). While the question seems straightforward,
    it is inherently ambiguous due to the nature of zip codes. Zip codes are not designed
    to provide precise geographic locations or directions and can cover a range of
    areas that may not align perfectly with latitude lines. Additionally, without
    precise geographic coordinates or a reliable map reference, determining a north-south
    relationship based solely on zip codes is not possible. Therefore, the question
    could lead to different interpretations and answers based on different assumptions
    about the locations of the zip codes involved.
  - 'The question asks if the location corresponding to the US zip code 36830 in Alabama
    is south of the location corresponding to the US zip code 75693 in Texas. This
    question can be interpreted in only one way: it seeks a geographical comparison
    between the two locations based on their latitude. Since zip codes are specific
    to certain areas, each zip code corresponds to a specific location, and the determination
    of whether one location is south of another is a straightforward geographical
    query. Therefore, the question does not admit more than one interpretation.'
  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographical location of two specific
    zip codes: 36830 in Alabama (AL) and 75693 in Texas (TX). The question is clear
    in its intent to determine whether one location is south of the other, based on
    their geographical positions. The interpretation of "south of" is straightforward
    in the context of geography, meaning a direct comparison of latitude between the
    two locations. There is only one correct geographical answer to this question
    based on the latitude of the zip codes.'
  - The question asks whether a specific zip code in Alabama (36830) is located south
    of another specific zip code in Texas (75693). The interpretation of the question
    is straightforward as it involves determining the geographical location of one
    zip code relative to another. The latitude of each location can be compared to
    provide a single, definitive answer. Therefore, the question does not admit more
    than one interpretation.
  - The question asks whether the location of the US zip code 36830, which is in Alabama
    (AL), is south of the location of the zip code 75693, which is in Texas (TX).

    position (specifically, the southern position) of one zip code area compared to
    another. There is only one interpretation of the question, which involves checking
    the geographical coordinates (latitude) of the two locations to determine which
    one is further south.
  - The question is asking whether the location of the zip code 36830 in Alabama is
    south of the location of the zip code 75693 in Texas. This question is geographically
    based and requires determining the relative latitude of these two locations. The

  - The question is asking whether one location in Maine, defined by the zip code
    04062, is located south of another location, defined by the zip code 04096. Zip
    codes generally increase numerically from east to west and from south to north,
    but this is not a strict rule and does not necessarily correspond to geographical
    location in terms of north-south orientation. Therefore, the question could be
    interpreted as asking about the numerical order of the zip codes or their actual
    geographical locations, leading to different interpretations and answers.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 04062 in Maine is located south of the
    zip code 04096 in Maine. Zip codes are not always assigned in a strictly geographical
    manner and can sometimes follow different patterns, such as population density
    or postal routes. Therefore, the question may seem straightforward, but the interpretation
    of "south" based solely on zip code numbers can be misleading. Without specific
    geographical coordinates or maps, it's unclear if the zip code 04062 is indeed
    south of 04096. This makes the question ambiguous as it relies on an assumption
    that zip codes correspond directly to geographical directions, which is not necessarily
    the case.
  - 'The question is asking whether the location associated with the zip code 04062
    in Maine is south of the location associated with the zip code 04096 in Maine.
    This question is clear in its intent: it seeks to determine the relative geographic
    positions of two specific zip codes within the state of Maine. The interpretation
    hinges solely on geographic information, and there is a definitive answer based
    on the latitude of each zip code. Therefore, the question does not admit more
    than one interpretation.'
  - 'The question asks whether one zip code in Maine (04062) is located south of another
    zip code in Maine (04096). The ambiguity arises from the fact that zip codes are
    not assigned in a strictly geographical manner and do not always correlate with
    latitude. Therefore, the question can be interpreted in different ways: one might
    interpret it as asking about the numerical order of the zip codes, while another
    might interpret it as asking about their actual geographical location. Without
    additional context, such as a map or a system that correlates zip code numbers
    with geographical direction, the question remains ambiguous.'
  - The question asks whether the zip code 04062 in Maine (ME) is located south of
    the zip code 04096 in Maine. Zip codes are numerical and do not inherently indicate
    geographic direction, as they are assigned based on postal routes and other factors.
    While it's possible to determine relative locations by checking a map or a database,
    the question itself is based on an assumption that zip codes can directly indicate
    north-south positioning, which is not always the case. However, given the specific
    numbers provided, a definitive answer can be given by checking the geographical
    locations associated with these zip codes.
  - The question is asking whether the zip code 04062 in Maine is located south of
    the zip code 04096 in Maine. However, zip codes are not assigned based on geographical
    latitude or north-south orientation, but rather on postal routes and other considerations.
    As such, the numerical order of zip codes does not necessarily correspond to their
    geographical positioning. Therefore, the question could be interpreted in different
    ways, such as asking about the numerical order of the zip codes or their actual
    geographical locations, leading to different answers. This makes the question
    ambiguous.
  - The question asks if one zip code (04062, ME) is located south of another zip
    code (04096, ME). However, zip codes do not inherently provide geographical orientation
    such as north, south, east, or west. They are primarily used for postal delivery
    purposes and do not follow a geographical sequence. Therefore, using zip codes
    alone to determine geographic location is ambiguous, as it assumes zip codes are
    organized in a linear or geographic manner, which they are not.
  - The question asks whether the location associated with the zip code 04062 in Maine
    (ME) is south of the location associated with the zip code 04096 in Maine. Zip
    codes are numerical codes used by the postal service to identify specific regions
    and do not inherently convey geographic directionality such as north or south.
    The question assumes that the order of zip codes correlates with geographic latitude,
    which is not a rule governing zip code assignments. Therefore, interpreting this
    question requires additional information beyond the zip codes themselves, such
    as a map or geographic data. This makes the question ambiguous because it relies
    on assumptions about how zip codes are assigned geographically.
  - The question is asking whether the location with the zip code 04062 in Maine (ME)
    is south of the location with the zip code 04096 in Maine. Zip codes are not always
    sequentially organized in a north-south or east-west manner. Therefore, determining
    the relative southward position based solely on zip codes is not straightforward
    and requires geographical knowledge of the specific areas. This could lead to
    different interpretations based on how one understands or interprets the relationship
    between zip codes and geographical locations. Additionally, without specific geographical
    knowledge or additional context, there might be different answers regarding their
    relative positions.
  - The question involves determining the geographical position of two locations based
    on their ZIP codes in Maine, USA. ZIP codes are numerical representations used
    by postal services to identify specific regions for mail delivery purposes. They
    do not inherently convey geographical orientation or positioning such as north
    or south. The question assumes that ZIP codes can be used to determine whether
    one location is south of another, which is not a reliable method as ZIP codes
    do not follow a strictly geographical order. Therefore, the question is ambiguous
    because it relies on an incorrect premise about the nature of ZIP codes, leading
    to potential multiple interpretations or the need for additional context or clarification
    about how the ZIP codes relate to geographic location.

  - The question asks whether one Texas zip code (77510) is located south of another
    Texas zip code (78211). This question is ambiguous because zip codes are not arranged
    in a strictly geographical order. Therefore, determining if one zip code is geographically
    south of another based solely on the numbers is not possible without additional
    geographical data. Furthermore, zip codes can cover irregularly shaped areas that
    do not lend themselves to a straightforward north-south comparison.
  - The question asks if the zip code 77510 in Texas is located south of the zip code
    78211 in Texas. The interpretation of "south" could refer to the geographical
    direction on a map. However, zip codes are not inherently arranged in geographical
    order, and their numerical sequence does not correspond to geographical locations.
    Therefore, answering this question based on zip code numbers alone without additional
    geographical data is ambiguous. The question could also be interpreted as asking
    about the numerical order of the zip codes, which is different from geographical
    positioning.
  - The question asks whether the location corresponding to the zip code 77510 in
    Texas is south of the location corresponding to the zip code 78211 in Texas. This

    comparing the latitude of the two locations. However, zip codes are not always
    arranged in a strictly north-to-south order, and without additional context or
    tools, the question assumes an understanding of geographical coordinates associated
    with each zip code. Despite this, the question itself does not present multiple
    interpretations; it simply requires factual information about the relative positions
    of the two zip codes. Thus, the question is clear in its intent but may require
    specific knowledge or resources to answer.'
  - The question involves determining the relative geographic location of two specific
    ZIP codes in Texas, 77510 and 78211. While ZIP codes can give a rough idea of
    location, they are not inherently ordered in a way that clearly indicates geographic
    position (north, south, east, west). Without a map or additional context, ZIP
    codes themselves do not provide clear directional information, and thus the interpretation
    of "south" could vary depending on different factors or sources of information.
    Therefore, the question can be interpreted in more than one way regarding how
    one ZIP code relates to another geographically, leading to potential different
    answers.
  - The question is asking whether a specific zip code (77510, TX) is located south
    of another zip code (78211, TX). Zip codes do not inherently contain geographical
    direction information like latitude or longitude that definitively describes their
    position relative to each other in terms of north or south. Therefore, determining
    whether one zip code is south of another requires additional geographical data
    beyond just the zip code numbers. Moreover, the question could be interpreted
    in different ways depending on the criteria used for determining "south" (e.g.,
    geographical center of the area covered by the zip code, southernmost point, etc.).
    This leads to potential ambiguity in how the question is answered.
  - 'The question asks whether a specific zip code, 77510 in Texas, is located south
    of another zip code, 78211 in Texas. The question seems straightforward, asking
    for a geographical comparison of two fixed points, which typically admits a clear

  - The question asks whether the location of one zip code (77510, TX) is south of
    another zip code (78211, TX). However, the question does not specify the criteria
    for determining the "south" direction (e.g., based on latitude, specific points
    within the zip code, or other geographical considerations). Furthermore, zip codes
    are not inherently geographical coordinates, and their numbers do not indicate
    geographical direction. Therefore, the interpretation of "located south" could
    vary, leading to different answers depending on how one chooses to interpret the
    criteria for "south." This makes the question ambiguous.
  - The question asks whether the location associated with the zip code 77510 in Texas
    is south of the location associated with the zip code 78211 in Texas. Zip codes

    within the state of Louisiana. The question is clear in its request for a geographical
    comparison of two specific zip codes: 70528 and 70510. The only interpretation
    is determining the relative geographical position (north or south) of these two
    locations. This can be answered with a map or geographical data. Therefore, the
    question has one interpretation and one correct answer.'
  - The question asks whether the location corresponding to the zip code 70528 in
    Louisiana (LA) is situated south of the location corresponding to the zip code
    70510, also in Louisiana. This question is based on geographical data, which typically
    provides a clear answer based on latitude. However, the question could be considered
    ambiguous because the relative position of zip codes does not necessarily correlate
    with numerical order, and without specific geographical data, the question could
    lead to different interpretations. Therefore, the question could be seen as potentially
    having more than one interpretation regarding the comparison of two geographical
    locations based solely on zip codes.
  - The question is asking whether the location of the zip code 70528 in Louisiana
    is south of the location of the zip code 70510 in Louisiana. This question is
    clear because it specifies two distinct zip codes and asks for a geographical
    comparison based on their locations. There is only one correct geographical interpretation

    of the question is straightforward, focusing on the geographical positioning of
    two specific zip codes. There is only one correct answer based on the geographical
    data available for these zip codes.
  - The question is asking if the zip code 70528 in Louisiana is located south of
    the zip code 70510 in Louisiana. Zip codes are numerical representations for postal
    delivery areas and do not inherently provide geographical directionality such
    as north or south. While zip codes can sometimes be sequentially organized, this
    is not a reliable indicator of geographical direction. Therefore, determining
    whether one zip code is "south" of another requires additional geographical information
    or a map reference, which is not provided in the question. Thus, the question
    is ambiguous without further context or clarification on how the location is determined.
  - 'The question asks whether the location corresponding to the US zip code 70528
    in Louisiana (LA) is south of the location corresponding to the US zip code 70510
    in Louisiana. This question is specific and geographic in nature, requiring a
    comparison of the relative latitudinal positions of the two zip codes. It admits
    only one interpretation: determining the relative north-south position based on
    geographic data. Therefore, it has a clear and singular correct answer based on
    map data.'
  - The question asks if one zip code is located south of another zip code. While
    zip codes can be used to determine general locations, they are not inherently
    directional and do not provide precise geographic information. Additionally, without
    specific geographic data or maps, it is ambiguous to determine if one zip code
    is south of another solely based on their numeric values. Therefore, the question
    admits more than one interpretation because zip codes do not directly correlate
    to specific directional locations without further geographic context.
  - 'The question asks whether one specific zip code (70528, LA) is located south
    of another zip code (70510, LA). This can be interpreted in only one way: geographically
    determining the relative north-south position of the two zip codes within the
    state of Louisiana. There is a single correct answer based on the geographic coordinates
    of these zip codes. Therefore, the question admits only one interpretation and
    one correct answer.'
  - The question is asking if one zip code (70528, LA) is located south of another
    zip code (70510, LA). The question assumes that zip codes can be directly compared
    in terms of geographic direction based solely on their numerical values, which
    is not necessarily the case. The numbering of zip codes does not directly correlate
    to geographic positioning, and without additional geographic information, it's
    unclear if 70528 is indeed south of 70510. Thus, the question admits more than
    one interpretation regarding the method of determining "south," leading to different
    answers.

    of "south" (e.g., in terms of postal routing or another contextual factor). Additionally,
    zip codes can represent non-contiguous areas, which adds another layer of potential
    ambiguity in determining "south." The question does not provide enough context
    to definitively determine the criteria for "south." Thus, different interpretations
    could yield different answers.

    Therefore, the question is ambiguous because ZIP codes do not provide a straightforward
    way to determine north-south geographical positioning. Additionally, ZIP codes
    in New York do not follow a sequential geographical pattern from north to south.
    Thus, interpreting the question based on ZIP code numbers alone could lead to
    different answers. The question could be interpreted as asking for a comparison
    based on geographical latitude, which ZIP codes do not directly indicate.
  - The question is asking whether the location of one US zip code is south of another.
    However, zip codes are not inherently ordered by geographic coordinates such as
    latitude or longitude. They are primarily used for mail delivery purposes and
    can be organized in various ways, often not reflecting their geographical position.
    The zip code 11231 is in Brooklyn, NY, and 11436 is in Queens, NY. Determining
    which is further south requires additional geographical knowledge beyond the zip
    codes themselves. Therefore, the question can be interpreted in different ways
    depending on one's understanding of zip code organization and geographic knowledge.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 11231 in New York is located south of the
    zip code 11436 in New York. This can be interpreted in a straightforward manner
    by looking at the geographical locations of these zip codes. Zip code 11231 is
    in Brooklyn, and zip code 11436 is in Queens. In terms of geographical location,
    Brooklyn is generally south of Queens. Therefore, the question has a clear interpretation
    regarding geographical direction and can be answered based on the known locations
    of these zip codes.
  - The question is asking whether one zip code in New York is located south of another
    zip code. While zip codes can sometimes be used to infer general geographic areas,
    they are not always organized in a strictly north-to-south manner. Additionally,
    without specific geographic knowledge or a map, it's unclear whether one zip code
    is indeed south of the other based solely on their numbers. The question relies
    on a geographic interpretation of zip codes, which is not straightforward and
    can lead to multiple interpretations or require external information to answer
    definitively.
  - 'The question asks whether the zip code 11231, NY is located south of the zip
    code 11436, NY. Zip codes in the US do not necessarily follow a north-south geographical
    order, and they are not inherently indicative of latitude or geographic positioning.
    Therefore, the question could be interpreted in different ways: one might assume
    it refers to geographic positioning (latitude), while another might assume it
    refers to zip code numbering, which does not correlate with geographic north-south
    orientation. This leads to ambiguity in determining the intended basis for "south."
    Hence, the question is ambiguous because it admits more than one interpretation,
    leading to different potential answers.'
  - The question asks whether one US zip code, 11231, is located south of another
    zip code, 11436, both in New York. While zip codes can sometimes indicate a general
    geographic area, they are not always arranged in a strictly north-south or east-west
    manner. However, in this specific case, 11231 (Brooklyn) is indeed located geographically
    south of 11436 (Queens). The question is straightforward and refers to a specific
    geographic inquiry about the relative locations of two zip codes, which can be
    answered by examining their actual geographic positions.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 11231, NY is located south of the zip code
    11436, NY. Zip codes are numerical and often assigned in a way that does not necessarily
    correspond to geographical north-south or east-west directions. Additionally,
    zip codes are not inherently geographical indicators of cardinal directions. Without
    specific geographical mapping or additional context, such as the knowledge of
    the areas these zip codes cover, the question cannot be definitively answered
    based on the zip code numbers alone. This makes the question ambiguous as it requires
    additional interpretation or information to determine the relative location of
    these zip codes.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 11231 in New York is located south of the
    zip code 11436 in New York. The interpretation depends on geographical knowledge
    rather than multiple interpretations of the question. Zip codes are numerical
    and geographical identifiers, and their numbers do not necessarily correspond
    to geographic directions. However, both zip codes are in New York City, with 11231
    in Brooklyn and 11436 in Queens. Given the geographic layout of these boroughs,
    11231 (Brooklyn) is generally located to the west and slightly south of 11436
    (Queens). This geographic interpretation is straightforward, so the question is
    clear in its intent.
  - 'The question is asking whether one US zip code, 11231, is located south of another
    zip code, 11436, within New York. The interpretation is straightforward: it seeks
    to determine the relative geographical position of one zip code in relation to
    another. However, zip codes do not follow a strictly geographic order and can
    be non-contiguous, so knowing their numbers alone does not provide information
    on their relative positions. To answer the question, one would need to look up
    the geographical locations associated with these zip codes. The question admits
    one interpretation but requires external data to determine the correct answer.'

  - The question asks if the location of a specific zip code in Minnesota (55055)
    is south of another zip code in Wisconsin (54474). The question is clear in its
    intent to compare the geographical locations of these two zip codes in terms of
    their north-south positioning. Zip codes are specific identifiers for geographic
    regions, and determining their relative positions on a map can yield a single
    correct answer. Thus, the question does not admit multiple interpretations; it
    is straightforward and can be answered definitively based on geographical data.
  - The question asks whether the location associated with the zip code 55055 in Minnesota
    is south of the location associated with the zip code 54474 in Wisconsin. The
    question is clear in its intent, as it seeks to determine the relative geographical
    positioning (specifically latitude) of two specific zip codes. There is only one

    one interpretation and one correct answer.'
  - The question asks if the location corresponding to the zip code 55055 in Minnesota
    is south of the location corresponding to the zip code 54474 in Wisconsin. Zip
    codes are not organized strictly by geographic latitude, so the question cannot
    be answered based solely on the zip code numbers. However, if interpreted as a
    question about geographic latitude, it could be verified using a map or a geographic
    database. Therefore, the question has a clear interpretation in terms of geographic
    location, and only one correct answer based on latitude comparison.
  - The question is asking whether one location is south of another based on their
    zip codes. However, zip codes are not geographical coordinates and do not inherently
    convey north-south positioning. Therefore, the question could be interpreted as
    asking for a geographical comparison based on zip code numbers, which is not a
    reliable method to determine latitude. Additionally, the question doesn't specify
    whether "south" should be understood in terms of latitude or another metric. This
    makes the question ambiguous as it can be interpreted in multiple ways without
    a clear method to derive a definitive answer.
  - 'The question involves determining the relative geographic locations of two U.S.
    ZIP codes: 55055 in Minnesota (MN) and 54474 in Wisconsin (WI). While ZIP codes
    do often have some geographic correlation, they are not strictly ordered in a
    north-to-south or east-to-west manner. The question is asking about a geographic
    direction (south) in relation to ZIP codes, which are not inherently directional.
    However, if interpreted as a request to compare the latitude of two locations,
    there is only one correct answer based on geographic coordinates. The question
    thus admits a single interpretation (geographic location comparison) and a single
    correct answer based on latitude data.'
  - The question involves the geographical location of two zip codes, 55055 in Minnesota
    (MN) and 54474 in Wisconsin (WI). It is asking if the location of 55055 is south
    of 54474. This question is asking for a comparison based on latitude, which is
    a clear geographical concept. Since zip codes are uniquely assigned to specific
    areas, the question can be answered definitively by checking the latitudinal positions
    of the two zip codes. Therefore, the question admits only one interpretation and
    one correct answer based on geographical data.
  - 'The question asks whether one location (55055, MN) is south of another location
    (54474, WI) based on their zip codes. This can be interpreted in a straightforward
    manner: it seeks to determine the relative north-south geographical position of
    these two locations. Zip codes themselves are not inherently indicative of geographical
    positions, but they can be associated with specific cities or areas. Therefore,
    the question is asking for a comparison of the geographical latitude of two known
    locations based on their zip codes, which is a clear query with one correct answer
    based on geographical data.'
  - The question asks whether the zip code 55055 in Minnesota is located south of
    the zip code 54474 in Wisconsin. This question is about geographical location,
    and the interpretation hinges on understanding the relative positions of these
    two specific zip codes. Zip codes are numerical representations of geographic
    areas, and their numbers do not necessarily correlate to their physical location
    in terms of north, south, east, or west. Therefore, the question requires looking
    up the specific locations of these zip codes to determine their relative positions.
    The question is clear in that it asks for a specific comparison based on geographic
    location, which would lead to a single correct answer once the location data is
    consulted.

  - The question asks whether one location in New York (zip code 10703) is south of
    another location in New York (zip code 11789). This could be interpreted as a
    question about geographical latitude, where "south" refers to being at a lower
    latitude. However, zip codes do not necessarily correlate with geographic latitude
    or any specific north-south order. Without additional context or a specific method
    for determining "south" (such as using latitude), the question can be seen as
    ambiguous. Different interpretations (e.g., using zip code numbers or actual geographic
    locations) could lead to different answers.
  - The question asks whether the location of one ZIP code in New York is south of
    another ZIP code. While ZIP codes are numerical and often increase sequentially
    in a specific geographic region, they do not always correlate directly with geographic
    latitude or cardinal direction. Without specific geographic information or mapping,
    the question can be interpreted differently based on assumptions about the relationship
    between ZIP codes and geography. Therefore, determining whether one ZIP code is
    geographically south of another based solely on their numerical values can lead
    to multiple interpretations.
  - The question asks about the relative location of two US zip codes, 10703 and 11789,
    in terms of their position (south or not) within New York. While it might seem
    straightforward, zip codes are not assigned strictly based on geographical coordinates,
    and they do not follow a north-to-south or east-to-west pattern. Additionally,
    without specific geographical information, such as longitude and latitude, or
    a map, the question cannot be definitively answered based on zip codes alone.
    The question could be interpreted as asking about general postal area location
    or specific geographical latitude, leading to different interpretations and answers
    depending on the context (postal service vs. geographic location). Therefore,
    the question admits more than one interpretation.
  - This question is asking whether one location in New York (zip code 10703) is geographically
    south of another location in New York (zip code 11789). The question is straightforward
    and clear in its intent to compare the geographic positions of two specific zip
    codes. There is one interpretation and one correct answer based on geographic
    data.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographical location of two zip codes
    in New York: 10703 and 11789. The interpretation seems straightforward as it asks
    whether one specific location is south of another. However, determining "south"
    based on zip codes can be ambiguous because zip codes are not necessarily arranged
    in a linear or geographical order. Thus, without additional context or a map,
    the question can lead to different answers based on different interpretations
    of how to determine the direction between two zip codes.'
  - The question asks whether one US zip code (10703) is located south of another
    (11789) within the state of New York. However, the interpretation of "south" could
    vary based on the reference point used. Zip codes are not necessarily arranged
    in a geographical north-south order, as they are primarily used for postal delivery
    purposes and may not reflect geographic locations accurately. Therefore, determining
    whether one zip code is "south" of another solely based on their numerical values
    or even their general area might not lead to a definitive answer without additional
    geographical data. Consequently, the question could be interpreted in different
    ways, leading to different conclusions depending on the method or data used for
    analysis.
  - The question asks if a specific location identified by the zip code 10703, NY
    is located south of another location identified by the zip code 11789, NY. This
    question could be considered ambiguous because zip codes are not strictly arranged
    in geographical order. While a higher numerical zip code might suggest a location
    further east in the state, it does not necessarily indicate the north-south position.
    Therefore, determining the relative southward position based solely on zip codes
    without additional geographical information could lead to different interpretations.
  - The question asks whether a specific zip code (10703, NY) is located south of
    another zip code (11789, NY). Zip codes are numerical codes used for mail delivery
    purposes and do not directly correlate to geographical positions such as north
    or south. While one might attempt to interpret the numbers in the zip codes as
    indicating geographic positioning, this is not a reliable or standardized method
    of determining relative location. Therefore, the question is ambiguous because
    it relies on an incorrect assumption about the meaning of zip code numbers and
    does not provide clear geographic data to make a definitive comparison.
  - The question is asking if one location in New York, identified by the zip code
    10703, is located south of another location with the zip code 11789. Zip codes
    generally increase numerically as they move north to south, but this is not a
    strict rule and does not apply uniformly across all regions. Therefore, the zip
    code number itself does not provide sufficient information to determine geographic
    direction or position. The question assumes that zip codes can be used to determine
    geographic location in terms of north-south orientation, which is not inherently
    accurate. Furthermore, without additional geographic data or context, the question
    cannot be definitively answered based solely on zip codes. This makes the question
    open to multiple interpretations regarding how one might determine "south of"
    in this context.
  - The question asks whether the location associated with the zip code 10703 is south
    of the location associated with the zip code 11789 in New York. The interpretation
    of "south" is straightforward as it pertains to geographical direction. Zip codes
    are specific to particular areas, so the question can be answered by looking at
    the geographical positions of these two zip codes. Therefore, the question only
    admits one interpretation, which is determining the relative geographical positions
    of these two locations.

    Zip codes are numerical and are primarily used for postal delivery purposes rather
    than geographical positioning. However, they do generally follow a geographical
    pattern. In this case, 48322 is in West Bloomfield, MI, and 01351 is in the area
    of Lanesborough, MA. Geographically, Michigan is generally located west of Massachusetts,
    but the question specifically asks about a north-south orientation. Since West
    Bloomfield, MI, is indeed south of Lanesborough, MA, the question has a clear

    room for interpretation. Additionally, zip codes do not inherently convey geographic
    positions in terms of north-south orientation, and the question assumes a level
    of geographic knowledge or access to a map. Despite these nuances, the primary
    interpretation is geographic latitude, making the question mostly clear in its
    intent to determine relative north-south positioning.
  - The question asks whether one location (20759, MD) is south of another location
    (47025, IN) based on their zip codes. The interpretation hinges on geographical
    positioning, which can be clearly determined using maps or geographical data.
    There is only one correct answer to whether one location is geographically south
    of another. Therefore, the question is clear and admits only one interpretation
    and answer.
  - 'The question asks whether the location of the zip code 20759 in Maryland is south
    of the location of the zip code 47025 in Indiana. This question is geographically
    straightforward, as zip codes are specific areas with defined locations. Therefore,
    it admits only one interpretation: a geographic comparison between two specific
    locations. The answer is based on the latitude of the two zip codes and whether
    one is south of the other.'
  - The question asks whether a specific zip code in Maryland (20759) is located south
    of another zip code in Indiana (47025). On the surface, it seems like a straightforward
    geographic comparison. However, the question is ambiguous because zip codes do
    not inherently contain geographical information about north-south orientation.
    Additionally, the question does not specify what metric (latitude, general perception
    of state locations, etc.) should be used to determine "south of." Different interpretations
    of "south of" could lead to different answers (e.g., using the centroid of the
    zip code areas, specific city locations within those zip codes, or arbitrary boundaries).
    Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation.
  - The question is asking whether the location of the zip code 20759 in Maryland
    is south of the location of the zip code 47025 in Indiana. This question involves
    determining the geographical positions of the two zip codes and comparing their
    latitudinal coordinates. There is a clear method to interpret and answer this
    question by looking up the geographical data for these zip codes, which leads
    to only one correct answer based on their coordinates. Therefore, the question
    admits only one interpretation and one correct answer.
  - 'The question asks whether the zip code 20759 in Maryland is located south of

  - The question is asking about the relative location of two zip codes, 55316 and
    55038, in Minnesota. Zip codes are numerical codes used to identify specific geographic
    regions, but they do not inherently provide precise geographical data such as
    latitude or longitude. Therefore, determining whether one zip code is south of
    another purely based on the zip code numbers can be ambiguous without additional
    geographic information. The question does not provide details on how to interpret
    the location data, leading to potential ambiguity in how to determine which zip
    code is south of the other.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative location of two zip codes in Minnesota:
    55316 and 55038. The question can be interpreted in terms of geographical latitude,
    where "south" typically means having a lower latitude. However, zip codes are
    not always assigned in a strictly geographical order, so a higher numerical zip
    code is not necessarily located north of a lower numerical zip code. Therefore,
    without additional geographical data, the question can be ambiguous as the zip
    codes themselves do not directly correspond to geographical positioning in terms
    of north-south orientation.'
  - The question asks whether a specific zip code (55316, MN) is located south of
    another zip code (55038, MN). Zip codes are primarily for mail delivery and do
    not inherently indicate geographic directionality. While it is possible to determine
    the relative geographic locations of these zip codes, the question's phrasing
    might imply that zip codes themselves contain directional information, which they
    do not. Therefore, the question is ambiguous because it assumes a relationship
    between zip codes and geographic orientation that is not inherently provided by
    zip codes themselves.
  - The question is asking whether one zip code in Minnesota is located south of another.
    While zip codes are typically organized geographically, they do not strictly follow
    a north-south or east-west order. Therefore, determining the relative location
    of one zip code to another based solely on the numbers can be misleading. Additionally,
    without specific knowledge of the geographic boundaries of these zip codes, the
    question could be interpreted in different ways, leading to potentially different
    answers based on different sources or criteria (such as the geographic center
    of the zip code areas). Thus, the question admits more than one interpretation,
    making it ambiguous.
  - The question asks whether the location of the zip code 55316 in Minnesota is south
    of the location of zip code 55038 in Minnesota. The question involves comparing
    geographical positions based on zip codes, which is a straightforward interpretation.
    Zip codes are specific and unique, and their geographical locations can be determined.
    Therefore, the question has only one interpretation and one correct answer based
    on the actual geographical positions of these zip codes.
  - The question is asking whether one zip code (55316) is located south of another
    zip code (55038) within Minnesota. Zip codes are primarily used for mail delivery
    and do not always follow geographical logic such as north-to-south or east-to-west
    ordering. Therefore, determining if one zip code is geographically south of another
    solely based on zip code numbers can be misleading. Additionally, without specific
    geographical data or mapping, the interpretation of "south" in terms of zip code
    numbers is ambiguous. Hence, the question can be interpreted in different ways,
    either by relying on geographical data or interpreting zip code numbers, leading
    to different answers.
  - This question is asking whether the location identified by the zip code 55316
    in Minnesota is situated to the south of the location identified by the zip code
    55038 in Minnesota. The question is clear in its request for a geographical comparison
    based on the latitude of two specific zip codes. There is only one interpretation,
    which involves looking up the geographical coordinates or maps to determine the
    relative north-south positioning of these zip codes.
  - 'The question is asking whether the location corresponding to the zip code 55316
    in Minnesota is south of the location corresponding to the zip code 55038 in Minnesota.
    The interpretation of "south" in this context is clear: it refers to the geographical
    position relative to each other based on latitude. The question assumes knowledge
    of the geographical locations associated with these zip codes. Since zip codes
    can be mapped to specific geographic coordinates, this question has a single interpretation
    and can be answered definitively using geographical data. Therefore, the question
    is clear in its intent and can be answered by comparing the latitudes of the two
    zip codes.'
  - The question asks whether the location associated with the zip code 55316 in Minnesota
    is south of the location associated with the zip code 55038 in Minnesota. It is
    a geographic question that can be answered by looking up the latitude coordinates
    of the two zip codes. The interpretation of "south" is clear and typically refers
    to a lower latitude. Thus, the question admits only one interpretation and one
    correct answer based on geographic data.
  - The question is asking whether the location of zip code 55316 in Minnesota is
    south of the location of zip code 55038 in Minnesota. This can be interpreted
    in a straightforward geographical manner, as zip codes are typically assigned
    specific geographic areas. The interpretation of "south of" is also clear in a
    geographic context, meaning whether one location is below the other on a standard
    map where north is up and south is down. Therefore, this question admits only
    one interpretation and one correct answer based on geographical data.

  - The question is asking whether a specific zip code (91803) is located south of
    another zip code (90048) within the state of California. Zip codes are numerical
    codes used to identify specific geographic regions, but they do not directly correlate
    with latitude or geographic positioning north-south. While zip codes can sometimes
    provide a rough geographic ordering, they are not reliable for determining precise
    geographic relationships such as "south of" without additional context or geographic
    data. Therefore, interpreting the question in terms of geographic location based
    solely on zip codes is ambiguous.
  - The question asks whether a specific zip code, 91803 in California, is located
    south of another zip code, 90048 in California. Zip codes are primarily used for
    mail delivery purposes and do not necessarily follow a strict geographical pattern
    that would align perfectly with cardinal directions like north or south. While
    the numbers may suggest a certain order, they do not reliably indicate geographic
    location in terms of north-south orientation. Therefore, the question is ambiguous
    because it relies on an assumption that zip codes inherently indicate geographical
    direction, which is not consistently true. The interpretation of "south" could
    be based on numerical order or actual geographic location, leading to different
    answers.
  - The question is asking whether the location of the zip code 91803 in California
    is south of the location of the zip code 90048 in California. The question is
    specific and seeks a geographical comparison between two fixed points based on
    their zip codes. The interpretation of the question is straightforward, as it
    involves determining the relative north-south position of these two zip codes.
    This can be resolved using geographical data, and there is only one correct answer
    based on the actual locations of these zip codes.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 91803 in California is located south of
    the zip code 90048 in California. Zip codes are numerical codes that are generally
    assigned in a geographic pattern; however, they do not strictly correspond to
    latitude or geographic direction. Therefore, determining whether one zip code
    is south of another based solely on the zip code numbers is not straightforward
    and can lead to different interpretations. A more accurate method would involve
    looking at the actual geographic locations or latitude of the areas corresponding
    to these zip codes. Without additional geographic information, the question could
    be interpreted in different ways, leading to different conclusions.
  - 'The question involves comparing the relative geographical locations of two ZIP
    codes in California: 91803 and 90048. ZIP codes do not inherently convey geographic
    direction or relative positioning (such as north or south) because they are primarily
    designed for postal delivery purposes and do not follow a strict geographic pattern.
    Therefore, the question could be interpreted in different ways, such as asking
    about the physical location on a map or based on ZIP code numbering. Without additional
    context or a specific system for interpreting ZIP codes geographically, the question
    admits more than one interpretation, which could lead to different answers.'
  - 'The question asks whether the location of the ZIP code 91803 in California is
    south of the location of the ZIP code 90048 in California. ZIP codes are generally

    or east-west order. Therefore, determining whether one ZIP code is south of another
    requires specific geographic information rather than relying solely on the numeric
    order of the ZIP codes. However, the question itself is clear in its intent to
    compare the geographic locations of two specific ZIP codes. It admits only one
    interpretation: determining the relative geographic positions of these two ZIP
    codes. The answer to the question depends on geographic data, not on the ambiguity
    of the question itself.'

  - The question asks whether the location associated with the zip code 62918 in Illinois
    is south of the location associated with the zip code 67101 in Kansas. The interpretation
    hinges on geographical positions based on zip codes. Zip codes generally increase
    from east to west and from north to south in the United States, but they are not
    strictly sequential or directly correlated with latitude. Therefore, determining
    whether one zip code is south of another based solely on the zip code numbers
    can be ambiguous. Additionally, without specific geographical data about these
    zip codes, the question could lead to different interpretations about their relative
    positions, making it difficult to provide a definitive answer without additional
    context or a map reference.

  - The question asks whether the location corresponding to the zip code 33573 in
    Florida is south of the location corresponding to the zip code 32963 in Florida.
    This question is clear because it is asking for a geographical comparison based
    on latitude between two specific zip codes. Given that zip codes are fixed geographical
    areas, there is only one correct interpretation and answer based on their locations
    on the map.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 33573 in Florida is located south of the
    zip code 32963 in Florida. This question assumes a straightforward geographic
    interpretation based on the numeric order of the zip codes. However, zip codes
    are not always assigned in a strictly geographic manner, and the numeric value
    does not necessarily correlate with geographic location. Without specific geographic
    data about these zip codes, the question could lead to different interpretations
    about what "south" means in this context. Thus, the question can be seen as ambiguous
    because it relies on an assumption that may not hold true without additional context.
  - The question is asking whether the location of the zip code 33573 in Florida is
    south of the location of zip code 32963 in Florida. The interpretation of "south"
    is straightforward in this context, referring to a geographical position on a
    map. Zip codes are specific to geographic areas, and it is possible to determine
    whether one zip code area is geographically south of another using a map or geographical
    coordinates. Thus, this question has one clear interpretation and can be answered
    definitively by comparing the geographical locations of the two zip codes.
  - The question asks whether the location of zip code 33573 in Florida is south of
    zip code 32963 in Florida. While it may seem straightforward, the question is
    ambiguous because zip codes are not strictly ordered geographically. Zip codes
    were created for mail delivery purposes and do not follow a strict north-to-south
    or east-to-west order. Therefore, determining if one zip code is geographically
    south of another based solely on their numerical values can lead to incorrect
    conclusions. Additionally, without specific geographical data or maps, it is unclear
    how the zip codes are situated relative to each other in terms of latitude.
  - The question asks whether a specific zip code (33573) in Florida is located south
    of another zip code (32963) in Florida. This question might seem straightforward,
    but it involves geographic knowledge of the location of these zip codes within
    the state. The question could be interpreted as asking for a comparison of the
    geographic positions (latitude) of these zip codes. However, without a map or
    additional geographic data, it might not be immediately clear to someone whether
    one zip code is south of the other, especially since zip codes are not necessarily
    assigned in geographic order. Therefore, the question does admit more than one
    interpretation depending on the availability and interpretation of geographic
    data regarding zip codes.

    of the location of the zip code 32963 in Florida. This question is clear and specific,
    as it pertains to geographical locations that can be determined using maps or
    geographical data. There is only one interpretation here, which involves comparing
    the latitude of the two zip codes to determine which one is further south.
  - The question asks whether one specific location (33573, FL) is south of another
    location (32963, FL) in Florida. ZIP codes are specific to certain geographic
    areas, and their relative positions can be determined by looking at a map or using
    geographic data. This question is asking for a straightforward comparison of two
    specific geographic points, which allows for a clear and singular interpretation
    based on the latitude of the ZIP codes.
  - The question asks whether the location of the zip code 33573 in Florida is south

  - The question asks whether the zip code 01107 in Massachusetts is located south
    of the zip code 01129 in Massachusetts. This question appears to be ambiguous
    because zip codes do not inherently follow a geographical north-south or east-west
    order. While one might assume a numerical sequence could indicate a geographical
    order, this is not the case with U.S. zip codes, which are assigned based on postal
    routes and other logistical considerations. Therefore, the question could be interpreted
    differently depending on whether one assumes zip codes imply geographical positioning
    or understands them as arbitrary numerical designations. Without additional geographical
    information about the specific locations of these zip codes, the question admits
    multiple interpretations and potential answers.
  - The question asks whether one specific zip code (01107, MA) is located south of
    another zip code (01129, MA). Zip codes are primarily used for mail delivery and
    do not necessarily correlate with geographical coordinates such as latitude or
    longitude. The question assumes that zip codes can be directly compared in terms
    of north-south positioning, which is not a reliable method for determining geographical
    location. Additionally, zip codes can be non-contiguous and do not always follow
    a linear geographical pattern. Therefore, the question is ambiguous because it
    relies on an inaccurate assumption about the nature of zip codes and their geographical
    positioning.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 01107 in Massachusetts is located south
    of the zip code 01129 in Massachusetts. At first glance, this seems straightforward;
    however, zip codes are not assigned in a strictly geographical manner. Therefore,
    the question may not have a clear answer based solely on zip code numbers. Additionally,
    without specific geographical data or a map, determining the relative locations
    of these zip codes is not possible. The question is ambiguous because it assumes
    a geographical relationship based on zip code numbers, which may not accurately
    reflect their actual locations.
  - The question is asking whether one zip code (01107, MA) is located south of another
    zip code (01129, MA). This requires a geographical comparison between two specific
    locations based on their zip codes. Zip codes are numeric and can be mapped to
    specific locations, but they do not inherently convey directional information
    such as north or south. Additionally, zip codes do not always follow a strict
    geographical order. Without additional geographical data or context, it is difficult
    to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes solely based on their
    numbers. Therefore, the question could be interpreted in multiple ways depending
    on the source of the geographical data used to determine the relative locations
    of these zip codes.
  - 'The question is asking whether the location of one US zip code (01107, MA) is
    south of another zip code (01129, MA) within the state of Massachusetts. The interpretation
    of the question is straightforward: it is asking about the geographical relationship
    between two specific zip codes. There is only one way to interpret this question,
    and it requires determining the relative geographical positions of the two zip
    codes. The question does not present any ambiguity in its interpretation.'
  - The question is asking whether the location of one zip code (01107, MA) is south
    of another zip code (01129, MA). However, zip codes do not inherently indicate
    geographical direction or position relative to each other, as they are primarily
    used for mail delivery purposes and not designed to represent geographical coordinates.
    Therefore, determining whether one zip code is south of another requires additional
    geographical information not provided in the question. This makes the question
    ambiguous because it lacks the necessary context to determine a definitive answer
    based on the zip codes alone.
  - 'The question is about the geographical location of two US zip codes: 01107 and
    01129, both in Massachusetts. The question asks whether 01107 is located south
    of 01129. However, US zip codes are not assigned based on geographical coordinates
    but rather for postal routes and delivery purposes. Therefore, zip codes do not
    inherently convey north-south or east-west positioning. Without additional geographical
    data, this question is ambiguous because zip codes do not directly correlate to
    geographical orientation, and multiple interpretations or methods (such as using
    a map or a database) would be needed to determine a north-south relationship between
    these zip codes.'
  - The question asks whether the zip code 01107 in Massachusetts is located south
    of the zip code 01129 in Massachusetts. Zip codes are numerical and do not inherently
    convey geographic information such as direction (north, south, etc.). While zip
    codes in the U.S. can sometimes increase in number as they move in a specific
    direction (generally east to west or north to south), this is not a consistent
    rule and can vary widely. Thus, determining the direction between two zip codes
    based solely on their numbers is not reliable. Additionally, without a specific
    map or geographic data, the interpretation of "south" is ambiguous in this context.
    Therefore, the question can admit multiple interpretations and potential answers
    depending on different understandings of zip code geography and the availability
    of specific location data.
  - The question asks whether one zip code (01107, MA) is located south of another
    zip code (01129, MA). While zip codes are numerical, they do not necessarily correlate
    with geographical north-south positioning. The question might be interpreted as
    asking about the geographical location in terms of latitude. However, without
    additional context or geographical data, the question could be ambiguous since
    zip codes are not inherently designed to indicate geographical direction. Additionally,
    the question could be interpreted as asking about postal routes or service areas,
    which may not align with geographical directions.
  - The question asks whether the location associated with the ZIP code 01107 in Massachusetts
    is south of the location associated with the ZIP code 01129 in Massachusetts.
    ZIP codes are generally assigned in a geographic manner, but they are not strictly
    linear in terms of latitude. Therefore, without specific geographic information
    about these particular ZIP codes, the question could be interpreted in different
    ways. Furthermore, ZIP codes may not directly correlate with latitude, making
    it unclear whether the question is asking about a strict north-south relationship
    or something else. The ambiguity arises because ZIP codes do not inherently provide
    latitude information, and assumptions about their geographic sequence could lead
    to different answers.

    code corresponds to a specific area that can be identified on a map. In this case,
    01830 corresponds to Haverhill, Massachusetts, and 53185 corresponds to Waterford,
    Wisconsin. By looking at a map, one can determine that Haverhill, MA (01830) is
    indeed located north of Waterford, WI (53185). The question is clear in its request

  - The question asks if the location of the zip code 15014 in Pennsylvania is south
    of the location of the zip code 18102 in Pennsylvania. This question could be
    interpreted in multiple ways because zip codes are not inherently geographical
    indicators of north-south positioning. Zip codes are primarily used for mail delivery
    purposes and do not necessarily follow a geographical order. Therefore, without
    additional geographical information or a specific context of interpretation, this
    question can lead to different answers based on how one interprets the relevance
    of zip codes to geographical positioning.
  - The question asks whether one zip code in Pennsylvania (15014) is located south
    of another (18102). While zip codes are primarily used for postal delivery and
    do not directly correlate with geographic directions, they can sometimes provide
    a rough indication of location. However, without a specific map or additional
    context about the geographic layout of these zip codes, the question could be
    seen as ambiguous since zip codes do not follow a strictly north-to-south or east-to-west
    numerical order. Additionally, the question assumes a geographic interpretation
    of zip codes, which is not their primary purpose.
  - The question is asking whether one zip code in Pennsylvania is located south of
    another zip code in the same state. The question might seem straightforward, but
    it is ambiguous because zip codes are not necessarily arranged in a linear geographical
    order. The numerical order of zip codes does not correlate with geographical north-south
    orientation. Therefore, the question can lead to different interpretations based
    on whether one assumes zip codes are geographically ordered or not.
  - The question is asking whether one location (15014, PA) is south of another location
    (18102, PA) within Pennsylvania, based on their zip codes. The interpretation
    of "south" in terms of zip codes is not straightforward, as zip codes do not inherently
    convey geographical direction or latitude. Therefore, the question requires additional
    geographical knowledge or resources to determine the relative north-south positioning
    of the locations. This makes the question ambiguous, as zip codes do not directly
    indicate directional positioning.
  - The question asks whether a specific zip code, 15014 in Pennsylvania, is located
    south of another zip code, 18102, also in Pennsylvania. This question can be considered
    AMBIGUOUS because zip codes are not assigned based on geographical coordinates
    like latitude, which determines north-south positioning. Instead, zip codes are
    primarily based on postal routes and do not necessarily reflect geographical locations
    in terms of north and south. Therefore, using zip codes to determine if one location
    is south of another can lead to different interpretations and answers.
  - The question is asking whether the location with the zip code 15014 in Pennsylvania
    is south of the location with the zip code 18102 in Pennsylvania. The interpretation
    hinges on geographic locations associated with these zip codes. However, zip codes
    are not assigned based on geographic latitude or longitude but are instead organized
    by postal routes and other logistical considerations. Thus, while the question
    appears to be asking about geographic direction, it relies on zip codes which
    do not inherently convey geographic orientation. Consequently, the question can
    be seen as ambiguous because it implies a geographic relationship that zip codes
    do not consistently provide.
  - The question is asking whether the location of the zip code 15014 in Pennsylvania
    is situated south of the location of the zip code 18102, also in Pennsylvania.
    This question admits a clear interpretation, as it involves a geographical comparison
    between two specific zip codes. The answer can be determined by examining a map
    or using geographic data to compare the latitude of the two locations. Therefore,
    the question is clear and has one correct answer based on the geographical data
    available.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographical locations of two US zip

    determining "south" (e.g., based on latitude, which is common), and considering
    that zip codes do not inherently convey geographical coordinates, the question
    could be interpreted in different ways. For example, it could be asking for a
    comparison based on other factors like postal routes or general perceptions of
    location within the state, leading to different interpretations and answers.'
  - The question is asking whether one location in Pennsylvania (with zip code 15014)
    is geographically south of another location in Pennsylvania (with zip code 18102).
    While zip codes can give a rough idea of location, they do not follow a strict
    geographical order (e.g., north to south). Thus, determining whether one zip code
    is south of another based solely on the numbers can be ambiguous. To answer this
    question accurately, one would need to look up the actual geographical locations
    corresponding to these zip codes. The question could be interpreted as asking
    for a straightforward comparison based on zip code numbers or based on actual
    geographic location, which can lead to different approaches to finding the answer.
  - The question is asking whether one zip code in Pennsylvania is located south of
    another. However, zip codes are not inherently geographical indicators of north-south
    position, as they are based on postal routes rather than geographical latitude.
    Therefore, while the question might seem to have a straightforward yes/no answer
    based on geographic positioning, the use of zip codes introduces ambiguity because
    they do not map linearly to geographical locations in terms of north-south orientation.
    Additionally, without additional context or a map, it is not clear whether "south"
    refers strictly to latitude or some other criteria. This makes the question ambiguous.

    code 35215 in Alabama. This question is clear in its geographical inquiry, as
    it references specific zip codes within a specific state and asks for a comparison
    of their relative positions in terms of latitude. There is only one interpretation,
    which involves determining the geographical latitude of these zip codes to find
    out which one is further south.
  - The question asks whether one zip code (36201, AL) is located south of another
    zip code (35215, AL). This question can be considered ambiguous because zip codes
    are primarily designed for mail delivery purposes and do not always follow geographical
    logic. While it is possible to determine the general geographic location of each
    zip code, the question's use of "located south" might not align perfectly with
    the intended postal areas. Additionally, without a map or further geographical
    data, it is not immediately clear whether one zip code is south of the other.
    Therefore, different interpretations of what "south" means in this context could
    lead to different answers.
  - The question asks whether the location with the zip code 36201 in Alabama is situated
    to the south of the location with the zip code 35215 in Alabama. The interpretation
    hinges on geographical positioning, which is a straightforward concept. Zip codes
    are used to identify specific areas, and their geographical coordinates can be
    determined. Therefore, this question has a clear geographical interpretation and
    can be answered definitively by checking the latitude of the two zip codes to
    determine which is further south.
  - 'The question is asking whether the location of zip code 36201 in Alabama is south
    of the location of zip code 35215 in Alabama. This requires geographical knowledge
    about the relative positions of these two zip codes. The question is clear in
    its intent and admits only one interpretation: determining the relative geographical
    positions of the two specified zip codes. Therefore, there is only one correct
    answer based on the geographic locations of these zip codes.'
  - The question is asking whether the location of zip code 36201 in Alabama is south
    of the location of zip code 35215 in Alabama. This can be interpreted as a straightforward
    geographical question, which would typically be answered by comparing the latitude
    of the two zip codes. However, without additional context, such as whether the
    question pertains to a specific aspect of these locations (e.g., political boundaries,
    historical locations, etc.), the primary interpretation remains geographical.
    Thus, the question is clear in its intent to compare the latitudinal positions
    of the two zip codes.
  - The question is asking whether the location represented by the zip code 36201
    in Alabama is situated south of the location represented by the zip code 35215
    in Alabama. This question admits one interpretation, which involves determining
    the geographical positions of these two zip codes relative to each other. The
    question is clear in that it seeks a straightforward geographical comparison,
    which can be resolved by looking at a map or using geographical data. The zip
    codes in question are specific and have a single geographical location, thus allowing
    for one correct answer based on their latitude.
  - 'The question is asking if the location with the zip code 36201 in Alabama is
    south of the location with the zip code 35215 in Alabama. Zip codes are numerical
    and do not necessarily follow geographical order, so interpreting zip codes as
    geographical indicators may lead to confusion. Additionally, while zip codes can
    be used to identify general locations, the question relies on interpreting these
    codes as directly correlating to north-south positioning, which is not always
    accurate. Therefore, this question admits more than one interpretation: one could
    interpret it literally by zip code numbers or geographically by actual locations.
    This could lead to different answers depending on the method of interpretation.'
  - The question asks whether the location of the zip code 36201 in Alabama is south
    of the location of the zip code 35215 in Alabama. This is a geographical question
    about the relative positions of two specific zip codes. The interpretation of
    the question is straightforward, and it requires determining the latitude of each
    zip code's central point to answer if one is south of the other. Therefore, the
    question admits only one interpretation and one correct answer based on geographical
    data.
  - The question is asking whether one specific location (36201, AL) is south of another
    location (35215, AL). The question is clear in its intention to compare the geographical
    locations of two ZIP codes in Alabama, USA. However, the question can be considered
    ambiguous because ZIP codes do not always follow a strict north-south pattern,
    and ZIP codes can cover large areas that might span north and south directions.
    Additionally, without specific latitude and longitude information or a reliable
    map, one might not be able to conclusively determine the relative positions based
    solely on ZIP codes. Therefore, different interpretations about what constitutes
    "south" could lead to different answers.

  - The question is asking whether one zip code is located south of another. While
    zip codes can be used to identify general geographic areas, they are not designed
    to provide precise information about geographic positioning relative to each other,
    such as north or south. Additionally, zip codes can be non-linear and influenced
    by factors like population density rather than strictly geographical considerations.
    The question assumes zip codes can be directly compared in this manner, which
    could lead to different interpretations regarding how to determine "south of"
    using zip codes. Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation regarding
    how to determine geographic location based solely on zip codes.

  - 'The question asks if the location with the zip code 60564 in Illinois is south
    of the location with the zip code 02660 in Massachusetts. While it appears to
    be a straightforward geographical question, the use of zip codes to determine
    geographical direction can be misleading. Zip codes are numerical and don''t inherently
    provide geographical information such as latitude or longitude. However, assuming
    the question is asking about the actual geographical locations of the two places,
    the interpretation is clear: is the physical location of 60564, IL south of 02660,
    MA? Given the specific nature of the question about geographical location, it
    admits one interpretation and one correct answer based on geographical coordinates.'
  - The question asks whether a specific zip code in Illinois (60564) is located south
    of a specific zip code in Massachusetts (02660). The zip codes themselves do not
    inherently contain geographic orientation information, such as north or south,
    as they are primarily used for mail delivery purposes. However, the question can
    be interpreted as asking whether the geographic location associated with the zip
    code in Illinois is south of the geographic location associated with the zip code
    in Massachusetts. Since the state of Illinois is generally west and slightly south
    of Massachusetts, the question can be answered with geographic coordinates. Thus,

  - The question asks whether a specific zip code in Colorado (81632) is located south
    of a specific zip code in Maryland (21074). The interpretation of "south" in this
    context is geographical, relating to the latitude of the locations associated
    with these zip codes. However, zip codes do not directly correspond to latitude
    or north-south positioning, as they are primarily used for postal routes and can
    have irregular boundaries. Therefore, the question could be interpreted in different
    ways, such as asking about the relative latitude of the central points of these
    zip code areas or other geographical criteria, leading to ambiguity in determining
    a straightforward answer.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographic location of two specific
    US zip codes: 81632 in Colorado (CO) and 21074 in Maryland (MD). The question
    appears to be asking if 81632 is located geographically south of 21074. While
    zip codes can be used to approximate locations, they are not precise indicators
    of north-south positioning. Furthermore, the question might be interpreted in
    different ways, such as comparing the southernmost points of these zip code areas,
    or comparing the center points. However, in general geographic terms, Colorado
    is west of Maryland, and specific latitude comparisons would be necessary to definitively
    answer the question. Without additional context or clarification, the question
    can lead to different interpretations about how to compare the locations.'
  - The question asks whether the location of a specific zip code in Colorado (81632)
    is south of a zip code in Maryland (21074). While zip codes are geographically
    based, they do not directly correlate with latitude or north-south positioning
    in a straightforward manner because zip code boundaries can be irregular and non-linear.
    Furthermore, zip codes themselves do not inherently contain information about
    their geographic position relative to each other without additional geographic
    data. Thus, the question can be interpreted in different ways, such as asking
    about the latitude of the central point of each zip code or about the general
    north-south positioning of the areas they cover, which could yield different answers
    based on the interpretation method used.
  - The question asks if a specific zip code in Colorado (81632) is located south
    of another zip code in Maryland (21074). While the question seems straightforward,
    it is actually ambiguous because zip codes are not inherently related to geographic
    directionality such as north, south, east, or west. Zip codes are primarily used
    for mail delivery and do not follow a geographical order that aligns with cardinal
    directions. Therefore, interpreting a zip code as an indication of latitude (north-south
    position) is misleading and can lead to incorrect conclusions. A more appropriate
    approach to determine relative geographic locations would be to compare the actual
    latitude coordinates of the two locations. Thus, the question admits more than
    one interpretation regarding how to determine "south" in the context of zip codes,
    leading to potential differences in answering based on interpretation.
  - The question is asking whether the location of the US zip code 81632 in Colorado
    is south of the location of the zip code 21074 in Maryland. On the surface, this
    question seems straightforward as it involves comparing the geographical positions
    of two specific locations. However, the question could be considered ambiguous
    because it relies on the assumption that zip codes can be directly compared in
    terms of latitude, which is not always straightforward due to the way zip codes
    are distributed. Additionally, the phrasing "located south of" could be interpreted
    as asking about general latitude or perhaps even relative positioning considering
    different mapping systems. Given these factors, the question could admit more
    than one interpretation regarding how to compare these locations geographically.
  - The question is asking if a specific location in Colorado, identified by the zip
    code 81632, is located south of a specific location in Maryland, identified by
    the zip code 21074. The question assumes that zip codes can be directly compared
    geographically in terms of latitude (north-south positioning). However, zip codes
    are primarily postal codes and do not inherently convey precise geographical location
    data in terms of latitude or longitude. Therefore, the interpretation of "located
    south of" can be ambiguous because zip codes themselves do not provide this information,
    and additional data would be needed to determine the actual geographical positions
    of these locations. Thus, without additional context or geographical data, the
    question admits more than one interpretation regarding how to determine "south
    of" using zip codes alone.
  - The question asks whether one zip code (81632, CO) is located south of another
    zip code (21074, MD). The query is straightforward in terms of geographic interpretation,
    as it asks for a comparison of the latitudinal positions of the two locations.
    However, the question could be considered ambiguous because zip codes do not necessarily
    correspond to single geographic points; they can cover areas of varying sizes.
    Thus, the southernmost point of 81632 could potentially be south of the northernmost
    point of 21074, depending on the exact borders of these zip code areas. Additionally,
    without specific knowledge of the exact geographic coordinates or boundaries,
    there might be some ambiguity in determining the precise answer based solely on
    zip codes.
  - The question asks whether one US zip code (81632, CO) is located south of another
    zip code (21074, MD). Zip codes are primarily used for mail delivery and do not
    directly correlate with geographical locations in terms of latitude. However,
    generally speaking, Colorado is geographically west and south of Maryland. Despite
    this, the question is clear in its request to determine a directional relationship
    based on geographical latitude between two specific zip codes. There is only one
    correct interpretation based on the geographical positions of these two locations.
  - The question asks whether one specific zip code in Colorado is located south of
    another specific zip code in Maryland. While the question seems straightforward,
    zip codes are primarily used for postal services and do not directly correlate
    with geographical coordinates such as latitude and longitude. Additionally, the
    question does not specify whether it refers to the southernmost point, the central
    point, or another specific point of each zip code area. Due to these factors,
    the question could lead to different interpretations regarding what is meant by
    "located south of," which could result in different answers depending on the interpretation
    of how to compare the locations of zip codes geographically.
  - The question is asking whether the location with the zip code 81632 in Colorado
    is south of the location with the zip code 21074 in Maryland. Zip codes are primarily
    used for postal purposes and do not necessarily follow a strict geographical order.
    Therefore, determining whether one zip code is geographically south of another
    requires additional geographic information beyond the zip codes themselves. However,
    given the specific zip codes and states mentioned, it is possible to determine
    the relative geographic positions. The question is clear in its request for a
    geographic comparison between two specific locations.

    not have multiple interpretations that could lead to different answers.
  - The question asks if a specific zip code in Connecticut (06415) is located south
    of a specific zip code in Illinois (60478). Zip codes are numerical codes used
    for mail delivery and do not provide geographical information regarding latitude
    or cardinal directions such as north or south. Therefore, determining whether
    one zip code is south of another based solely on their numerical values is not
    possible. However, if we interpret the question based on actual geographic locations,
    we can find that Colchester, CT (06415) is geographically north of Country Club

    in a straightforward geographical context without ambiguity. Therefore, it admits
    one interpretation and one correct answer based on the geographical location of
    the zip codes.
  - The question is asking whether one location (23111, VA) is located south of another
    location (67216, KS) based on their zip codes. The interpretation of "south" is
    clear in a geographical context, meaning one location is positioned below the
    other on a map. Therefore, the question admits one interpretation, which involves
    determining the geographical positions of these two locations and comparing their
    latitudes. This question can be answered definitively by looking up the geographical
    coordinates of both zip codes and comparing their latitudinal positions.

  - The question asks if zip code 19134 in Pennsylvania is located south of zip code
    19131 in Pennsylvania. While zip codes can often follow a general pattern where
    higher numbers are located further south, this is not a strict rule, and zip codes
    are not strictly geographical. Therefore, determining whether 19134 is south of
    19131 requires specific geographical data rather than relying on zip code numbers
    alone. This makes the question clear in terms of what it is asking, as it requires
    checking the geographical locations of the zip codes to answer correctly.
  - The question is asking whether the location of the zip code 19134 in Pennsylvania
    is south of the location of the zip code 19131 in Pennsylvania. This question

  - The question asks whether the zip code 48127 in Michigan is located south of the
    zip code 48210 in Michigan. Zip codes are not inherently geographical indicators
    of north or south locations; they are primarily for postal routing. While in some
    cases zip codes might align geographically in numerical order, this is not a consistent
    or reliable method for determining geographic location. Therefore, the question
    could be interpreted as asking for a geographic comparison based on zip codes,
    which is not a precise method for determining such information. The question could
    also be interpreted as asking for postal routing information, which might not
    align with geographic directions. Due to these potential interpretations, the
    question is ambiguous.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 48127 is located south of the zip code
    48210 in Michigan. Zip codes are not inherently geographical in terms of north-south
    orientation, as they are primarily for postal delivery purposes. Therefore, determining
    if one zip code is "south" of another based solely on the numbers is not straightforward.
    Additionally, without specific geographical data about these zip codes, it's not
    possible to definitively answer the question. Thus, the question can be interpreted
    in more than one way depending on how one interprets the use of zip codes for
    geographic orientation.
  - The question is asking whether one zip code in Michigan is located south of another
    zip code in Michigan. Zip codes do not inherently convey geographical directions
    such as north or south, as they are primarily for mail delivery purposes and do
    not follow a linear geographical pattern. The interpretation of whether one zip
    code is south of another is ambiguous because zip codes are not designed to represent
    specific directional relationships. Without additional geographical data or a
    map, this question can lead to different answers based on different interpretations
    of how zip codes are distributed geographically.
  - The question is asking if the location associated with the ZIP code 48127 is south
    of the location associated with ZIP code 48210. ZIP codes are numerical identifiers
    for postal delivery routes and do not necessarily follow a geographical order.
    Thus, ZIP codes cannot be used to directly determine geographical positions such
    as north or south relative to each other. The question may seem straightforward,
    but the interpretation of ZIP codes as indicators of geographical direction is
    flawed. The question can be interpreted in terms of postal routes or actual geographical
    location, leading to different answers. Therefore, the question is ambiguous due
    to the potential misinterpretation of ZIP codes as geographical indicators.
  - 'The question is asking about the geographical location of two zip codes: 48127
    and 48210, both in Michigan. The question seeks to determine if 48127 is south
    of 48210. Zip codes are not strictly ordered geographically, meaning a higher
    zip code number does not necessarily indicate a location further north or south.
    Therefore, determining if one zip code is south of another based on their numerical
    order can lead to different interpretations. One could interpret the question
    to be asking about geographic location without additional context about how to
    determine the direction solely based on zip codes.'
  - The question is asking whether the zip code 48127 in Michigan is located south
    of the zip code 48210 in Michigan. While zip codes can sometimes be used to estimate
    locations, they do not always follow a geographical north-to-south or east-to-west
    order. Therefore, the question relies on an assumption about the geographical
    ordering of zip codes that may not be accurate. Additionally, without explicit
    geographical data, there could be multiple interpretations of what "south of"
    means in this context (e.g., strictly latitude-based, or considering the actual
    layout of the area). Hence, the question can be considered ambiguous.
  - 'The question asks whether the zip code 48127 in Michigan is located south of
    zip code 48210 in Michigan. Zip codes are primarily used for mail delivery purposes
    and do not necessarily follow a geographic north-south order. Therefore, the question
    could be interpreted in multiple ways: one could interpret it as asking about
    the numeric order of the zip codes, which is clear, or about the actual geographic
    location, which requires additional geographic knowledge or resources to determine.
    Due to the potential for different interpretations and the lack of geographic
    alignment with zip codes, this question is ambiguous.'
  - The question is asking whether the location of the zip code 48127 is south of
    the location of the zip code 48210. This is a geographical query that depends
    on the relative positioning of these two zip codes. The question is clear because
    it seeks a specific geographical comparison based on latitude, which can be answered
    definitively by checking a map or a database of zip codes. There is only one correct
    interpretation of the question, which involves determining the north-south orientation
    of these two zip codes.
  - The question asks whether the location associated with the zip code 48127 in Michigan
    is south of the location associated with the zip code 48210 in Michigan. Zip codes
    do not inherently follow geographic directions such as north or south, and without
    additional geographic information, the relative position cannot be determined
    solely based on the zip codes. Therefore, the question may lead to different interpretations
    depending on whether one assumes zip codes are sequentially aligned geographically
    or not.
  - The question asks if the zip code 48127, MI is located south of the zip code 48210,
    MI. While the question seems straightforward, zip codes are not always assigned
    in a strictly geographic or sequential manner. Therefore, the numerical order
    of zip codes does not necessarily correspond to their geographic positions relative
    to each other. This can lead to multiple interpretations about how to determine
    "south," whether by numerical order or actual geographic location. Thus, the question
    could be interpreted differently based on assumptions about how zip codes relate
    to geography.

  - The question asks whether the location of the zip code 46235 in Indiana is south
    of the zip code 43125 in Ohio. This is a geographically based question, and it
    is clear in its intent. Zip codes are well-defined geographical areas, and their
    relative positions (such as north, south, east, or west of each other) can be
    determined using a map or geographical data. Therefore, the question admits one
    interpretation and one correct answer based on geographical data.
  - The question is asking whether a specific zip code, 46235 in Indiana, is located
    south of another zip code, 43125 in Ohio. The interpretation revolves around geographic
    location, which can be determined using latitude coordinates. However, the ambiguity
    arises from the fact that zip codes do not necessarily align perfectly with geographic
    north-south lines due to how they are distributed. Moreover, without specific
    geographic coordinates, the question could be interpreted as asking about specific
    boundaries or characteristics that may not strictly relate to latitude. Therefore,
    while the question seems clear at first glance, the lack of specific geographic
    data and the nature of zip code distribution introduce ambiguity in determining
    a definitive answer.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 46235, which is located in Indiana (IN),
    is south of the zip code 43125, which is located in Ohio (OH). This question is
    clear in its intent as it is asking for a geographical comparison based on latitude

  - The question is asking about the relative location of two US zip codes, 65810
    and 23602, which are associated with specific locations. The zip code 65810 is
    in Springfield, Missouri (MO), and 23602 is in Newport News, Virginia (VA). The
    question is asking whether the location associated with the zip code 65810 is
    south of the location associated with the zip code 23602. This is a clear geographic
    question that can be answered by looking at a map or using geographic coordinates
    to determine the relative north-south positions of these locations.
  - The question asks whether a specific ZIP code (65810, MO) is located south of
    another ZIP code (23602, VA). It provides two ZIP codes along with their respective
    states (MO for Missouri and VA for Virginia). The question can be interpreted
    clearly in terms of geographical location, specifically latitude, to determine
    which ZIP code is further south. However, there is a minor ambiguity in the phrasing
    "65810, MO," as ZIP codes are specific to areas and not strictly tied to state
    boundaries. Despite this, the question remains largely clear as it is asking for
    a geographical comparison based on the ZIP codes provided. ZIP codes can be checked
    for their latitude to provide a clear answer.
  - The question asks whether a specific US zip code in Missouri (MO) is located south
    of a specific US zip code in Virginia (VA). The question is clear in its request
    to compare the geographical locations of two zip codes to determine their relative
    north-south positioning. However, there is a factual error in the premise. Zip
    code 65810 is actually in Springfield, Missouri, and zip code 23602 is in Newport
    News, Virginia. While the question is clear in its structure and intention, the
    factual error regarding the state associated with zip code 65810 (MO instead of
    VA) may lead to confusion. Despite this, the question itself remains clear in
    what it is asking.
  - The question asks if the zip code 65810, which is associated with the state of
    Missouri (MO), is located south of the zip code 23602, which is associated with
    the state of Virginia (VA). The question provides specific zip codes and associated
    states, which makes the geographic comparison straightforward. Zip codes are unique
    identifiers for specific geographic areas, allowing for a clear determination

    directly pertains to geographic positioning based on provided zip codes.
  - The question asks whether a specific zip code in Missouri (65810) is located south
    of another specific zip code in Virginia (23602). The question seems to imply
    a geographical comparison based on latitude. However, there is ambiguity because
    zip codes are not always perfectly aligned with geographic coordinates, and without
    additional context, it's unclear if the question is asking about the general location
    of the cities associated with these zip codes, or the precise geographic coordinates
    of the centroids of these zip code areas. Moreover, there could be additional
    interpretations related to the context in which "south of" is being used (e.g.,
    culturally, economically, etc.). Therefore, the question can be seen as having
    more than one interpretation.
  - The question asks whether a specific location with a given zip code (65810, MO)
    is located south of another location with a different zip code (23602, VA). The
    zip codes 65810 and 23602 correspond to geographical areas in the United States,
    specifically in Missouri and Virginia, respectively. Since zip codes are tied
    to specific locations, this question can be answered by determining the geographical
    coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the two zip codes and comparing their
    latitudes to see which is further south. Therefore, the question is clear and
    admits one correct interpretation and answer.
  - The question asks whether a specific ZIP code, 65810 in Missouri, is located south
    of another ZIP code, 23602 in Virginia. ZIP codes are numerical and do not inherently
    convey geographic information about latitude or north/south orientation. However,
    ZIP codes can be associated with specific geographic locations. Assuming the question
    is asking about geographic latitude, it can be interpreted clearly based on the
    actual geographic coordinates of these ZIP codes. Thus, the question is asking
    for a straightforward geographic comparison based on known data.
  - The question is asking whether a location identified by the zip code 65810, which
    is associated with the state of Missouri (MO), is located south of a location
    identified by the zip code 23602, which is associated with the state of Virginia
    (VA). The question is clear in its request for a geographic comparison based on
    latitude, and there is only one interpretation and one correct answer to whether
    one location is south of the other.
  - The question asks whether one location (65810, MO) is south of another location
    (23602, VA) based on their zip codes. The interpretation of "south" in this context
    is straightforward, referring to geographic latitude. However, the question could
    be ambiguous because ZIP codes typically do not directly correspond to geographic
    coordinates. Additionally, the ZIP code 65810 is actually located in Missouri,
    not Virginia, while 23602 is in Virginia. This could lead to confusion about the
    correct comparison. Despite this potential confusion, the question fundamentally
    seeks a geographic determination based on latitude, which admits one interpretation.
    Thus, it is clear in its intent.
  - The question asks whether a specific US zip code, 65810 in Missouri (MO), is located
    south of another specific US zip code, 23602 in Virginia (VA). The question seems
    to be straightforward in asking for a geographic comparison based on latitude.
    The zip codes are clearly identified, and the only task is to determine their
    relative positions in terms of north-south orientation. There is no ambiguity
    in the interpretation of the question as it is solely about geographic location.

    of the zip code area, the southernmost point, etc.). Additionally, zip codes often
    do not follow a straightforward geographic progression, which complicates determining
    a north-south relationship based solely on the zip code numbers. Without additional
    context or a specific method for determining "south," the question could be interpreted
    in multiple ways, leading to different answers.

    or using geographical data, one can determine the relative positions of these
    zip codes. There is only one interpretation of the question, which is determining
    the geographical positioning of two specific locations relative to each other.
    Therefore, the question admits one interpretation and one correct answer.
  - The question is asking whether one specific location, identified by its zip code
    (40031 in Kentucky), is located to the south of another location, also identified
    by its zip code (22554 in Virginia). The interpretation hinges on geographical
    positioning, which can be determined by looking up the latitude of each zip code.
    Since latitude is a clear and measurable factor, the question does not admit multiple
    interpretations. Therefore, it has only one correct answer based on the factual
    geographical data.

  - The question asks whether one location (07446, NJ) is south of another location
    (44281, OH) based on their zip codes. The question assumes that zip codes can
    be used to determine geographic direction, which is not accurate. Zip codes are
    not organized in a way that reflects geographical north-south or east-west positions.
    Therefore, the question is ambiguous because it is based on an incorrect premise
    that zip codes can indicate geographic direction, leading to potential misinterpretation.
  - The question asks whether one location is south of another based on their zip
    codes. However, zip codes do not inherently provide geographic north-south information.
    Zip codes are numerical identifiers and do not correspond to latitude or specific
    geographic directions. Thus, interpreting zip codes as indicators of geographic
    location in terms of north or south is not valid. The question could be interpreted
    as asking about geographic locations, but the use of zip codes as the basis for
    determining north or south is flawed. Therefore, the question is ambiguous because
    it relies on an incorrect assumption about the relationship between zip codes
    and geographic direction.
  - The question asks whether a specific location in New Jersey (with the zip code
    07446) is located south of a location in Ohio (with the zip code 44281). On the
    surface, this seems like a straightforward question comparing the geographical
    positions of two locations. However, the question is ambiguous because zip codes
    are not designed to provide precise geographical coordinates. They are primarily
    used for mail delivery and can cover irregularly shaped areas. Additionally, without
    additional context or a map, determining the relative positions of these locations
    solely based on zip codes is not feasible. Therefore, the question can be interpreted
    in different ways depending on how one approaches the comparison (e.g., using
    city centers, postal boundaries, etc.).
  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographic location of two US zip codes:
    07446 in New Jersey and 44281 in Ohio. The question is straightforward and asks
    whether one specific location is south of another specific location. There is
    only one interpretation and one correct answer to this question, which involves
    determining the latitudinal positions of the two zip codes. Therefore, the question
    is clear in its intent and does not allow for multiple interpretations.'
  - The question asks whether the location of the zip code 07446 in New Jersey is
    south of the zip code 44281 in Ohio. This question could be considered ambiguous
    because it does not specify whether "south" refers to the geographic center of
    each zip code area, a specific point within the zip code, or some other measure.
    Additionally, the question assumes that zip codes can be directly compared in
    terms of north-south positioning, which may not be straightforward due to the
    irregular shapes and sizes of zip code areas.
  - 'The question is asking whether the location of the zip code 07446 in New Jersey
    is south of the zip code 44281 in Ohio. The interpretation of the question is
    straightforward as it involves determining the relative geographic position of
    two specific zip codes. There is only one way to interpret this: by comparing
    their latitudinal positions on a map. Thus, the question is clear and admits one

    data.'
  - The question is asking if a location in New Jersey (zip code 07446) is south of
    a location in Ohio (zip code 44281). The question is clear in its intent to determine
    the geographical relationship (specifically, the north-south positioning) between
    the two given zip codes. There is only one correct interpretation and answer to
    the question, which can be determined by comparing the latitudinal coordinates
    of the two locations. Therefore, the question is clear and does not admit multiple
    interpretations.
  - The question is asking whether the location with the zip code 07446 in New Jersey
    is south of the location with the zip code 44281 in Ohio. While zip codes can
    provide some geographical information, they are not inherently organized in a
    way that directly corresponds to north-south or east-west directions. Furthermore,
    the question does not specify how to determine "south" (e.g., by latitude, by
    specific points within each zip code, etc.). The interpretation of "south" could
    be based on the central point of each zip code area, the southernmost point, or
    another reference, making it ambiguous without additional context or criteria
    for comparison.
  - 'The question involves determining the geographic location of two US zip codes
    relative to each other. The zip codes 07446 and 44281 correspond to specific areas
    in New Jersey and Ohio, respectively. The interpretation of the question is clear:
    it asks whether the location associated with the New Jersey zip code is south
    of the location associated with the Ohio zip code. There is a specific answer
    to this based on geographic coordinates, which does not admit multiple interpretations.'

    map. There is only one correct interpretation and answer to this question based
    on geographical data.
  - The question asks if the zip code 90606 is located south of the zip code 90255.
    The interpretation of "south" in this context is geographical, referring to whether
    one location is positioned further south in latitude than another. Zip codes are
    numerical and generally assigned in a way that can reflect geographical regions,
    but they do not inherently contain information about latitude or directional orientation.
    The question is unambiguous because it directly asks about geographical positioning
    relative to latitude, and there is only one correct interpretation and answer
    based on geographical data.
  - The question is asking whether the location associated with the zip code 90606
    in California is south of the location associated with the zip code 90255 in California.
    Zip codes are geographical regions and have specific latitude and longitude coordinates.
    The question is clear in its request for a geographical comparison based on latitude
    between two fixed points (zip codes), which should have a definitive answer. There
    is no ambiguity in the interpretation of the question, as it is specifically about
    the relative geographical positions of two zip codes.
  - 'The question asks whether one specific ZIP code (90606) is located south of another

    There is only one interpretation of the question: determining the relative north-south
    position of these two specific zip codes. Thus, it leads to one correct answer
    based on geographical data.'
  - The question is asking whether one location (90606, CA) is south of another location
    (90255, CA) based on their ZIP codes. ZIP codes in the United States are not strictly
    organized by geographical latitude, meaning that a higher or lower ZIP code number
    does not necessarily indicate a location further south or north. Therefore, interpreting
    the question based solely on ZIP code numbers would not provide an accurate answer.
    The question requires additional geographical data or clarification on whether
    the intent is to use geographical coordinates rather than ZIP code numbers. Due
    to this potential for multiple interpretations (ZIP code numbers versus geographical
    location), the question is ambiguous.
  - The question asks whether the location corresponding to the ZIP code 90606 in
    California is south of the location corresponding to the ZIP code 90255 in California.
    This is a clear geographic question that can be answered by looking up the respective
    locations of these ZIP codes and comparing their latitudes. There is only one
    correct answer based on the geographic data, so the question is not open to multiple
    interpretations.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 90606 is located south of the zip code

    the question, which is to determine the relative north-south positioning of these
    two zip codes. Therefore, the question is clear and admits one correct answer
    based on geographical data.
  - The question asks whether one specific zip code (90606) is located south of another
    specific zip code (90255), both in California. The interpretation of "south" here
    is geographical, meaning it pertains to the physical location of these areas relative
    to each other on a map. The question is clear because it requests a straightforward
    comparison of latitude between two fixed locations, which can be answered definitively
    using geographical data.

    Illinois is situated south of the location corresponding to the zip code 62208
    in Illinois. This question is based on geographical positioning which can be determined
    using a map or a reliable geographical database. There is only one interpretation
    of this question, which involves comparing the geographical latitudes of the two
    zip codes to determine which is further south. Therefore, the question has one
    correct answer based on geographical data.
  - The question asks whether the location identified by the zip code 62269 in Illinois
    is situated south of the location identified by the zip code 62208 in Illinois.
    This question is based on geographic coordinates, which can be objectively determined.
    Zip codes are assigned to specific geographic areas, and their relative positions
    (north, south, east, west) can be established using maps or geographic data. Therefore,
    the question has a single interpretation and can be answered definitively by checking
    the geographic locations of the two zip codes.
  - The question asks if one US zip code (62269, IL) is located south of another zip
    code (62208, IL). This is a straightforward geographical question about relative
    location, specifically whether one location is to the south of another within
    the same state (Illinois). The question does not present multiple interpretations
    because it is asking for a simple directional comparison based on geography. The
    answer can be determined by looking at a map or using geographical data to compare
    the locations of the two zip codes. Therefore, it admits only one interpretation
    and one correct answer.
  - The question asks whether the location corresponding to the US zip code 62269
    in Illinois is south of the location corresponding to the US zip code 62208 in
    Illinois. This question is clear because it is based on geographic locations that
    can be determined with precision using a map or GPS data. There is no alternative
    interpretation of what it means for one location to be "south" of another, as
    it simply refers to the relative position on the north-south axis.
  - The question asks whether the location associated with the zip code 62269 in Illinois
    is situated south of the location associated with the zip code 62208 in Illinois.
    This question can be interpreted in a straightforward manner as it pertains to
    geographical positioning. Zip codes are specific to certain areas, and their relative
    positions can be determined using geographical data. Therefore, the question has
    one clear interpretation and can be answered with factual geographical information.
  - The question asks if the zip code 62269 in Illinois is located south of the zip
    code 62208 in Illinois. On the surface, this question seems straightforward, as
    it pertains to the geographical location of two specific zip codes. However, the
    interpretation of "located south of" could be ambiguous without explicit knowledge
    of the geographical coordinates or map of these zip codes. Zip codes do not necessarily
    follow a north-south, east-west progression. Thus, without specific geographical
    data, the question could be interpreted differently based on different assumptions
    about the arrangement of zip codes. Therefore, the question can be seen as admitting
    more than one interpretation, as it requires additional geographical context to
    definitively determine the relative location.
  - 'The question asks if the location of the zip code 62269 in Illinois is south
    of the location of zip code 62208 in Illinois. The interpretation of the question
    is straightforward: it involves determining the geographical position of two specific
    zip codes relative to each other. Zip codes are fixed and their geographical positions
    are established, so there is only one correct answer based on their actual locations.
    Therefore, the question admits only one interpretation and one correct answer.'
  - The question is asking whether the location of one US zip code is south of another.
    This question could be interpreted in different ways because determining if one
    location is south of another can depend on the specific geographic boundaries
    or central points considered for each zip code. Zip codes are not always perfectly
    aligned with north-south orientations, and the geographic center of a zip code
    might not accurately represent its overall location. Thus, the question could
    have different answers depending on how the locations are assessed (e.g., by geographic
    center, by southernmost point, etc.).
  - The question asks whether one zip code (62269) is located south of another zip
    code (62208) within the state of Illinois. The query is based on geographic positioning.
    However, zip codes are not strictly organized in a linear geographic manner; they
    are determined based on postal routes and other logistical considerations. Without
    specific geographic data or maps, interpreting the relative location of these
    zip codes based solely on their numerical values can be misleading. This ambiguity
    arises from the assumption that higher or lower zip code numbers directly correlate
    to geographic positioning, which is not always the case. Therefore, the question
    can be interpreted in more than one way depending on one's understanding of how
    zip codes are organized geographically.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 62269 in Illinois is located south of the
    zip code 62208 in Illinois. Zip codes are generally assigned based on population
    density and postal routes rather than geographical latitude. Therefore, two zip
    codes cannot be reliably compared in terms of latitude without additional geographical
    data. The question implies a need for geographical comparison, which is not inherent
    in zip codes alone. This can lead to different interpretations based on whether
    one uses zip code numbers or actual geographic coordinates to determine "south."
    Hence, the question is ambiguous because it relies on an assumption that zip codes
    correlate with a north-south geographical arrangement, which they do not necessarily
    do.

  - The question asks whether one zip code in Vermont (05477) is located south of
    another zip code (05677) in Vermont. However, zip codes are not necessarily assigned
    in a geographical north-to-south order, and without specific geographical data
    about the locations of these zip codes, it is difficult to determine their relative
    positions. The question assumes a relationship between zip code numbering and
    geographical location that may not exist. Therefore, the question is ambiguous
    because it could be interpreted as asking for a geographical location comparison
    based on zip codes, which is not straightforward.
  - The question asks whether one zip code in Vermont (05477) is located south of
    another zip code in Vermont (05677). The ambiguity arises because zip codes are
    not assigned based on geographic location in a straightforward north-to-south
    manner. While lower zip code numbers can sometimes be found in the north and higher
    numbers in the south, this is not a strict rule. Therefore, interpreting whether

    ways: it could be asking about the numeric order of zip codes, or it could be
    asking about the actual geographic location, which may not correlate with the
    numerical order. This ambiguity in interpretation could lead to different answers,
    depending on whether the focus is on the numeric sequence or the actual geographic
    location.'
  - The question asks whether the zip code 05477 in Vermont is located south of the
    zip code 05677 in Vermont. While zip codes are often assigned in a geographical
    sequence, they do not always correlate perfectly with latitude or geographic direction.
    Therefore, determining whether one zip code is geographically south of another
    purely based on the numbers is not reliable. This introduces ambiguity because
    the question could be interpreted as asking about geographic location based on
    zip code numbers, which does not necessarily reflect true geographic positioning.
    Thus, the question can lead to different interpretations and answers depending
    on whether one interprets it as purely numerical or geographic.

  - The question asks whether the location corresponding to the zip code 05477 in
    Vermont is south of the location corresponding to the zip code 05677 in Vermont.
    The question assumes a correlation between the numerical order of zip codes and
    their geographical positions. However, zip codes are not assigned in a strictly
    geographical order, especially in states like Vermont where they were not necessarily
    distributed from north to south or east to west. Therefore, the question could
    lead to different interpretations and answers depending on whether one interprets
    it as asking about numerical order or actual geographical positioning.
  - The question asks if the zip code 05477 is located south of the zip code 05677,
    both of which are in Vermont. Zip codes are numerical and do not inherently convey
    geographical information about north-south orientation. While lower numbers might
    often be geographically lower, this is not a rule, especially within smaller regions
    like a single state. Without additional geographical data, the numbers alone cannot
    determine a north-south relationship. Thus, the question is ambiguous because
    it relies on an assumption that may not hold true.
  - The question asks whether the location of the zip code 05477 in Vermont is south
    of the location of the zip code 05677 in Vermont. This question is clear because
    it involves a straightforward comparison based on geographical data that determines
    the relative positions of the zip codes. The interpretation involves checking
    the geographic locations of the two zip codes to determine their north-south relation,
    which admits one correct answer based on geographical data.
  - The question is asking if the location associated with the ZIP code 05477 in Vermont
    is south of the location associated with the ZIP code 05677 in Vermont. ZIP codes
    are not strictly numerical in geographical ordering and do not necessarily follow
    a north-to-south or east-to-west pattern. Therefore, the question can be interpreted
    as asking about geographical locations rather than numerical order. Since ZIP
    codes do not inherently contain directional information, the interpretation depends
    on external geographical data about the locations of these ZIP codes. The question
    could be interpreted in terms of numerical order (which is misleading in this
    context) or actual geographic location, which requires additional information.
    Due to the potential for multiple interpretations based on how ZIP codes are perceived,
    the question is ambiguous.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 05477 in Vermont is located south of the
    zip code 05677 in Vermont. Zip codes are primarily used for mail delivery purposes
    and do not always follow geographical or north-south ordering. Without additional
    context about the specific geographical locations of these zip codes, it is not
    possible to definitively determine their relative positions based solely on the
    zip code numbers. Thus, the question is ambiguous as it admits more than one interpretation
    regarding the geographical positioning based on zip code numbers.

  - The question is asking whether the location of the zip code 77061 in Texas is
    south of the location of zip code 77031 in Texas. This question assumes that zip
    codes can be directly compared in terms of their geographical positioning based
    solely on their numerical order, which is not always the case. While zip codes
    can sometimes follow a geographical pattern, there is no inherent guarantee that
    a higher or lower zip code number directly correlates to a specific geographical
    direction such as north or south. Therefore, without additional context or a map
    for reference, the question could be interpreted in multiple ways, leading to
    different answers depending on the approach taken to determine the relative locations
    of the zip codes.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographic location of two specific
    zip codes in Texas: 77061 and 77031. To answer this question, one would need to
    look up the geographic coordinates or maps of these zip codes to determine their
    relative positions. The question is straightforward and does not have multiple
    interpretations or require subjective judgment. The answer depends solely on geographic
    data, which provides a clear and objective answer.'
  - The question asks whether one specific zip code, 77061, TX, is located south of
    another zip code, 77031, TX. This is a straightforward geographical inquiry about
    the relative location of two specific areas. Zip codes are fixed and have defined
    geographical boundaries, so there is only one correct answer to this question
    based on geographical data.
  - The question is asking whether the location associated with the zip code 77061
    in Texas is south of the location associated with the zip code 77031 in Texas.
    This question is geographically specific and requires knowledge of the locations
    associated with these zip codes. The question is clear in its intent, as it specifically
    asks for a directional relationship (south) between two known zip codes. There
    is only one correct answer based on geographic data regarding these zip codes.
  - The question is asking whether the location corresponding to the zip code 77061
    in Texas is situated south of the location corresponding to the zip code 77031
    in Texas. This question is clear in its intention, as it seeks a geographical
    comparison based on latitude between two specific zip codes within the same state.
    The question only admits one interpretation, which is to determine the relative
    southward position of 77061 compared to 77031. As such, the question can be answered
    by comparing the geographical locations of the two zip codes.
  - The question is asking whether the location of the zip code 77061 in Texas is
    south of the location of the zip code 77031 in Texas. This is a geographical query
    that can be answered by looking up the specific locations of these zip codes.
    Since zip codes have specific geographical boundaries, the question admits only
    one interpretation and one correct answer based on the geographical data available
    for these zip codes.
  - The question is asking if the location identified by the zip code 77061 in Texas
    is south of the location identified by the zip code 77031 in Texas. This appears
    to be a straightforward geographic query. However, zip codes are not always arranged
    in a strictly linear geographic manner and can be based on factors such as population
    density and postal routes, which means they might not necessarily align with cardinal
    directions. Thus, determining whether one zip code is "south" of another based
    solely on zip codes can be ambiguous without additional geographic data. Furthermore,
    the question does not specify whether it is asking about the centroids of the
    zip code areas or any specific locations within those zip codes, which adds to
    the ambiguity.
  - The question asks whether the location associated with the zip code 77061 in Texas
    is situated south of the location associated with the zip code 77031 in Texas.
    While zip codes can be used to approximate geographic locations, they do not inherently
    provide precise latitude or longitude data. Additionally, zip codes are not always
    assigned in a strictly geographic order. Therefore, without additional context
    or specific geographic data, the question could be interpreted differently based
    on various assumptions about zip code geography. This lack of specificity in determining
    geographic position based solely on zip codes makes the question ambiguous.
  - The question is asking whether the location associated with the zip code 77061
    in Texas is situated south of the location associated with the zip code 77031
    in Texas. Zip codes can be geographically mapped, and the relative positions can
    be determined with specific latitude and longitude data. Therefore, the question
    admits only one interpretation and has a single correct answer based on geographic
    data.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 77061 in Texas is located south of the
    zip code 77031 in Texas. The interpretation of "south" is straightforward in terms
    of geographical direction. However, zip codes are not always arranged in strict
    geographical order, and without specific geographical data for these zip codes,
    it is not possible to definitively determine the relative locations based solely
    on the zip code numbers themselves. Therefore, the question could be interpreted
    in different ways depending on how the relationship between zip codes is understood
    (numerical order vs. actual geographical location).

  - The question is asking whether the location corresponding to the zip code 56470
    in Minnesota is south of the location corresponding to the zip code 98338 in Washington.
    This can be interpreted geographically by comparing the latitudinal positions
    of the two locations. Since the question provides specific zip codes and states,
    and there is a clear method to determine which location is further south, the
    question admits only one interpretation and one correct answer.
  - 'The question is asking whether the location corresponding to the zip code 56470
    in Minnesota is south of the location corresponding to the zip code 98338 in Washington.
    The question involves geographical locations based on zip codes, which are fixed
    and uniquely assigned to specific areas. Therefore, the interpretation of the
    question is straightforward: it is asking for a comparison of the latitude of
    two fixed locations. Since zip codes correspond to specific geographical areas,
    the question admits only one interpretation and one correct answer.'
  - The question asks if the location of a specific zip code in Minnesota (56470)
    is south of a zip code in Washington (98338). While zip codes can give a general
    idea of location, they are not precise indicators of geographic latitude. However,
    this question can be interpreted clearly in terms of geographic latitude. The
    zip code 56470 is in Park Rapids, Minnesota, and the zip code 98338 is in Graham,
    Washington. By comparing their geographic latitudes, it is possible to determine
    which one is further south. Therefore, the question admits a single interpretation
    and a clear answer based on geographic coordinates.
  - The question asks whether one specific location (56470, MN) is south of another
    location (98338, WA) based on their zip codes. While zip codes can be used to
    identify general locations, they do not provide precise geographical coordinates.
    Additionally, the question involves two different states, Minnesota and Washington,
    which can be compared geographically. The question is clear in its intent to compare
    the geographical positions based on latitude. The interpretation is straightforward,
    as it requires determining the relative north-south position of two given locations.
    Therefore, the question admits one interpretation and one correct answer based
    on geographical data.
  - The question asks whether the location represented by the zip code 56470 in Minnesota
    is south of the location represented by the zip code 98338 in Washington. Zip
    codes can be used to determine relative geographic positions, and since Minnesota
    is generally east of Washington, we can infer that 56470 is indeed south of 98338
    based on the typical north-south orientation of the states in the U.S. The question
    is clear as it involves a straightforward comparison of geographic locations based
    on zip codes.
  - The question asks whether the location of the zip code 56470 in Minnesota is south
    of the location of the zip code 98338 in Washington. This requires interpreting
    geographical locations based on zip codes. Zip codes are not inherently arranged
    in a geographical order, and a zip code starting with a lower number is not necessarily
    south of a zip code with a higher number. However, both zip codes can be accurately
    mapped to their respective locations in Minnesota and Washington. Using geographical
    data, one can determine the relative north-south position of these two locations.
    Therefore, the question admits one interpretation and one correct answer based
    on geographical latitude.
  - The question asks whether a specific location in Minnesota (zip code 56470) is
    south of another location in Washington (zip code 98338). On the surface, this
    seems like a straightforward geographical question. However, the ambiguity arises
    from the fact that zip codes are not inherently geographical coordinates. They
    are primarily for postal purposes and do not directly correspond to latitude or
    longitude. Additionally, the phrasing "located south of" could imply either a
    direct geographical comparison or a comparison based on some other criteria (such
    as population or postal delivery routes), which are not specified. Therefore,
    without explicit clarification that the question is about geographic latitude,
    the question remains open to multiple interpretations.

  - The question is asking whether the location of the zip code 29154 in South Carolina
    is south of the location of the zip code 92503 in California. While the question
    seems to be straightforward in asking for a geographical comparison, it could
    be considered ambiguous due to the nature of geographical locations and zip codes.
    Zip codes are not designed to convey geographical coordinates directly and do
    not provide explicit latitude or longitude information. Additionally, the term
    "south" could be interpreted in different ways (e.g., strictly latitude-based
    or considering the general orientation of states). Furthermore, different mapping
    systems might yield slightly different results due to projection variations. These
    factors introduce ambiguity in determining a single correct answer without additional
    context or clarification on how "south" is being defined or measured.
  - The question is asking whether the location with the zip code 29154 in South Carolina
    is geographically south of the location with the zip code 92503 in California.
    The question is clear in its intent to compare the latitude of two specific locations.
    The latitude of a location is a fixed geographical attribute, and thus the question
    admits only one interpretation and one correct answer based on geographical data.
  - The question asks whether the location corresponding to the zip code 29154 in
    South Carolina is located south of the location corresponding to the zip code
    92503 in California. This question can be interpreted in multiple ways. One interpretation
    is strictly geographical, asking for a comparison of the latitude of the two locations
    to determine which is further south. Another interpretation could consider other
    factors like cultural or economic contexts, which might not align strictly with
    geographical coordinates. However, given the context of zip codes and the phrasing
    of the question, the most straightforward interpretation is geographical. Therefore,
    the question is primarily asking for a comparison based on latitude, which would
    lead to a clear answer if interpreted this way. However, the potential for different
    interpretations regarding what "south" means in non-geographical contexts makes
    it slightly ambiguous, but not enough to outweigh the primary interpretation.
  - The question is asking whether the location of the zip code 29154 in South Carolina

    zip codes are designed for mail delivery efficiency rather than geographic order.
    Additionally, both zip codes are in Kentucky, but without specific geographic

  - The question asks about the relative location of two US zip codes, 40211 and 40601,
    specifically whether 40211 is located south of 40601. While zip codes are often
    ordered geographically, they do not strictly follow a north-to-south or east-to-west
    pattern, especially within the same state. Additionally, zip codes can cover large
    areas, making it unclear whether one zip code is definitively south of another
    based solely on the numbers. The question also does not specify whether it is
    asking about the geographic center of the zip codes or some other point of reference.
    This makes the question potentially open to multiple interpretations regarding
    how one might determine the relative position of the zip codes, leading to different
    answers depending on the method used. Therefore, the question is ambiguous.
  - The question is asking whether a specific zip code (40211) is located south of
    another zip code (40601) within Kentucky. While the question seems straightforward,
    it is actually ambiguous for a couple of reasons. Firstly, zip codes do not necessarily
    follow geographical directions or linear progression. The numbers themselves are
    not indicative of location, so one cannot determine "south" based on the zip code
    numbers alone. Additionally, without a map or additional geographical data, determining
    whether one zip code is south of another requires interpretation beyond the information
    given in the question.
  - The question asks whether the location of one zip code (40211, KY) is south of
    another zip code (40601, KY). It seems straightforward as it requires determining
    the geographical position of two specific zip codes relative to each other within
    the state of Kentucky. However, the question could be ambiguous because zip codes
    do not strictly follow geographical lines and may not align perfectly with cardinal
    directions. Additionally, zip codes can span multiple areas and do not always
    correlate with precise geographical points. This could lead to different interpretations
    based on how one measures or defines "south" in relation to these zip codes.
  - The question involves comparing the geographical locations of two zip codes in
    Kentucky, 40211 and 40601, to determine which one is located further south. Zip
    codes are not strictly geographical indicators and may not follow a predictable
    north-south pattern. Therefore, without additional context or specific geographical
    data, the question is ambiguous because it could be interpreted in different ways
    depending on how one chooses to interpret the relationship between zip codes and
    geographical locations.
  - The question asks if the location associated with the zip code 40211 in Kentucky
    is south of the location associated with the zip code 40601 in Kentucky. The question
    is clear in its intent, as it seeks to determine the relative geographical position
    of two specific zip codes within the state of Kentucky. There is only one interpretation,
    which involves comparing the latitude of the two locations to determine which
    one is further south.
  - The question asks if zip code 40211 in Kentucky is located south of zip code 40601
    in Kentucky. It is clear in its intent to determine the geographical relationship
    between the two zip codes. However, the question assumes a correlation between
    zip code numbers and geographical location, which is not a consistent or reliable
    method for determining relative locations. Zip codes are not assigned based on
    geographical latitude, and thus, the question might lead to confusion if interpreted
    as expecting a direct correlation between the numerical order of zip codes and
    their geographical positions. Despite this, the question itself does not present
    multiple interpretations; it is straightforward in asking for a geographical comparison
    between the two specific zip codes, which can be verified through a map or geographical
    data. Therefore, the question is not ambiguous in its interpretation, but the
    method of analysis (using zip codes to determine location) is flawed.
  - The question is asking whether one specific location (40211, KY) is south of another
    specific location (40601, KY) in the state of Kentucky. The question is clear
    in its intent to compare the relative geographic positions of two specific ZIP
    codes. Since ZIP codes are unique identifiers for specific areas, the geographic
    relationship between them can be determined using maps or geographic data. Thus,
    the question admits only one interpretation and one correct answer based on geographic
    data.

  - The question asks whether the location of the zip code 33042 in Florida is south
    of the location of the zip code 33040 in Florida. Zip codes are numerical codes
    used to identify specific geographic areas, and they do not necessarily follow
    a strict geographical order. The question is based on the assumption that zip
    codes can be directly compared in terms of geographic direction (north-south),
    which is not always accurate. Zip codes can be assigned for postal route efficiency
    rather than strictly geographic considerations. Therefore, without additional
    geographical data about the specific locations of these zip codes, the question
    can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on how one perceives the relationship
    between zip codes and geographic direction. This leads to potential different
    answers based on additional geographic information or assumptions about zip code
    ordering.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 33042 in Florida is located south of the
    zip code 33040 in Florida. Zip codes are typically assigned geographically, but
    they do not always follow a strictly linear north-to-south or east-to-west order.
    While 33042 and 33040 are both in Florida, specifically in the Florida Keys, determining
    which one is south of the other based solely on zip code numbers can be misleading.
    However, in this specific case, the zip code 33042 (Big Pine Key) is indeed located
    north of 33040 (Key West), which could potentially lead to confusion based on
    assumptions about numbering. Despite this, the question is asking for a factual
    geographic relationship that can be verified, meaning there is one correct answer
    based on the actual locations of these zip codes.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 33042 in Florida is located south of the
    zip code 33040 in Florida. US zip codes generally increase numerically from east
    to west and from north to south. However, this is not a strict rule and exceptions
    exist. In this case, the zip code 33042 is indeed located north of 33040 in the
    Florida Keys. The question is asking for a geographical comparison based on zip

    codes are uniquely associated with specific geographic areas, there is only one
    correct interpretation and answer based on their geographic coordinates.
  - The question asks if one location (72904, AR) is south of another location (27505,
    NC) based on their zip codes. While zip codes can give a rough geographic indication,
    they are not coordinates and don't provide precise geographic locations. However,
    assuming the question is asking about geographic location, we can interpret it
    using known geographic data. Fort Smith, AR (zip code 72904) is indeed south of
    Broadway, NC (zip code 27505) when looking at a map of the United States. Therefore,
    the question has one interpretation based on geographic location and admits one
    correct answer.
  - 'The question asks if one zip code area (72904, AR) is located south of another
    zip code area (27505, NC). This is a geographic question that can be answered

    is straightforward: determine the relative north-south positions of the two zip
    codes based on their geographic coordinates. There is one clear interpretation
    and one correct answer based on the geographic data.'
  - The question asks whether the location of a specific zip code in Arkansas (72904)
    is south of another zip code in North Carolina (27505). Zip codes generally increase
    numerically from east to west and from north to south within the United States,
    but they are not geographic coordinates and do not inherently provide information
    about north-south orientation. To answer the question accurately, one would need
    to refer to a map or geographic data to determine the latitude of each location.
    However, the question is clear in its intent and asks for a specific geographic
    comparison, which can be resolved with the correct data, leading to a single correct
    answer based on geographic facts.

    interpretation that requires checking the geographical coordinates or positions
    of these zip codes to determine which one is further south. This task involves
    a straightforward comparison of latitude values for the two locations, which leads
    to one correct answer.

  - The question asks whether the location associated with the zip code 79925 in Texas
    is south of the location associated with the zip code 36037 in Alabama. This question
    requires an understanding of the geographical locations of these zip codes. Each
    zip code corresponds to a specific area, and there is only one way to determine
    the relative positions of these areas in terms of north-south orientation. Therefore,
    the question has a clear interpretation and a definitive answer based on geographical
    data.
  - The question is asking whether a specific zip code in Texas (79925) is located
    south of a specific zip code in Alabama (36037). While zip codes are typically
    numerical representations for specific geographic areas, they do not inherently
    provide information about latitude or cardinal directions. The question relies
    on comparing geographic locations based on zip codes, which requires additional
    geographic data to determine. However, the question itself is clear in its intent
    to compare the geographical positions of two areas in terms of latitude. Therefore,
    it admits only one interpretation regarding the directionality between the two
    specified zip codes.
  - The question asks whether the location associated with the zip code 79925 in Texas
    is south of the location associated with the zip code 36037 in Alabama. While
    zip codes can be used to identify specific geographic areas, the question does
    not specify whether it is asking about the central point of the zip code area,
    the southernmost point, or any other specific point within the zip code area.
    Additionally, zip codes are not inherently ordered by geographic location, which
    could lead to different interpretations of what "south of" means in this context.
    This makes the question ambiguous because it is unclear what specific criteria
    or points are being compared to determine if one zip code is "south of" the other.
  - The question asks whether the location of a specific zip code in Texas (79925)
    is situated south of a specific zip code in Alabama (36037). Zip codes are numerical
    codes used to identify specific geographic areas for postal purposes, but they
    do not inherently provide information about the geographical latitude or direction
    relative to each other. Thus, interpreting the geographical direction (south,
    north, etc.) based solely on zip codes can be ambiguous because zip codes are
    not arranged in a way that correlates directly with geographical positions like
    latitude. Additionally, the question could be interpreted as asking about a specific
    point within each zip code area, which could vary significantly depending on the
    specific location chosen within the zip code boundaries. This potential for multiple
    interpretations makes the question ambiguous.
  - The question asks whether the location with the zip code 79925 in Texas is south
    of the location with the zip code 36037 in Alabama. Although zip codes are primarily
    used for postal delivery purposes and do not necessarily correspond directly to
    geographic coordinates, this question can be interpreted in terms of latitude.
    The latitude of a location is a clear and measurable factor that can be used to
    determine whether one location is south of another. Thus, the question can be
    interpreted consistently by comparing the latitudes of the two locations. Given
    that 79925 is in El Paso, Texas, and 36037 is in Greenville, Alabama, it is possible
    to determine which is geographically further south. This interpretation leads
    to a single correct answer based on geographic data.
  - The question asks whether the location of the zip code 79925 in Texas is south
    of the location of the zip code 36037 in Alabama. This question is clear in its
    intent to compare the geographical latitude of two specific zip code locations
    to determine which is further south. Since zip codes are associated with fixed
    geographical areas, the question is straightforward and admits only one correct
    answer based on the geographical coordinates of the zip code areas.
  - The question asks whether the location corresponding to the zip code 79925 in
    Texas is south of the location corresponding to the zip code 36037 in Alabama.
    This question involves comparing the geographical latitude of two specific locations,
    which can be determined using their respective zip codes. Zip codes correspond
    to specific geographic areas, so this question has a clear interpretation and
    can be answered by looking up the latitude of each location to determine their
    relative position. Therefore, the question admits only one interpretation and
    one correct answer.
  - The question is asking if a specific location in Texas, identified by the zip
    code 79925, is located south of another location in Alabama, identified by the
    zip code 36037. The interpretation hinges on the geographic locations associated
    with these zip codes. However, zip codes do not inherently provide geographic
    coordinates or a clear indication of north-south positioning without additional
    mapping data. Therefore, the question could be interpreted in different ways depending
    on how one chooses to determine the "southern" location, whether by latitude or
    another geographic marker. This leads to ambiguity as the question does not specify
    the method for determining the relative southward location.
  - The question asks whether a location with the zip code 79925 in Texas is south
    of a location with the zip code 36037 in Alabama. The question could be interpreted
    in different ways because it relies on the assumption that zip codes can be used
    to determine geographical direction accurately. Zip codes are primarily for postal
    purposes and do not necessarily follow geographical latitude or longitude. Additionally,
    the question does not specify which point within each zip code should be considered
    for determining "south" (e.g., the center, a specific boundary point). Thus, the
    question admits more than one interpretation and could lead to different answers
    depending on how one interprets the use of zip codes for determining geographical
    direction.
  - 'The question involves comparing the geographical locations of two U.S. zip codes:
    79925, which is in Texas, and 36037, which is in Alabama. The question asks if
    one location (79925) is south of the other (36037). This is a straightforward
    geographical question that can be answered by looking at the relative latitudinal
    positions of the two zip codes. There is only one correct answer based on their
    geographical coordinates, making the question clear and unambiguous.'

    for specific geographic regions, and they do not inherently convey information
    about geographic location in terms of cardinal directions (north, south, east,
    west). Therefore, this question is seeking information about the relative geographic
    positions of two locations. The question can be interpreted clearly in terms of
    geographic latitude, which determines whether one location is north or south of
    another. Thus, the question only admits one interpretation and one correct answer
    based on geographic data.

  - The question is asking whether a specific zip code in Georgia (30332) is located
    south of a specific zip code in California (90274). The question seems straightforward,
    asking for a geographical comparison in terms of latitude between two specific
    locations. However, it does not specify what aspect of "south" is being considered
    (e.g., the general area covered by the zip codes, the central point of each zip
    code, etc.). Additionally, the phrasing could lead to confusion about whether
    "south" refers strictly to latitude or if it implies some other directional or
    contextual meaning. Given these considerations, there is room for multiple interpretations,
    leading to different methods of determining the answer.
  - 'The question asks whether the location of the zip code 30332 in Georgia is south
    of the zip code 90274 in California. The question is straightforward as it asks
    for a comparison of geographical locations based on latitude. There is only one
    interpretation: determining which zip code is located further south based on their
    geographical coordinates. Therefore, the question admits one interpretation and
    one correct answer.'
  - The question asks whether the location of the zip code 30332 in Georgia is south
    of the location of the zip code 90274 in California. This is a geographically
    based question, and zip codes can be precisely mapped to latitude and longitude
    coordinates. Therefore, there is only one correct answer based on geographical
    data. The question is clear in its request for a comparison of latitude positions
    of two specific zip codes.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 30332, GA is located south of 90274, CA.
    On the surface, this seems like a straightforward geographical question about
    whether one location is south of another. However, the use of zip codes to determine
    geographical location can be ambiguous because zip codes are not organized in
    a strictly north-south manner across the country. Moreover, the question does
    not specify what is meant by "located south of," which could be interpreted as
    meaning the southernmost point of each zip code, the central point, or some other
    criteria. This could lead to different interpretations and thus different answers.
  - The question is asking whether the location associated with the zip code 30332
    in Georgia (GA) is south of the location associated with the zip code 90274 in
    California (CA). Zip codes are numerical codes used for mail delivery and do not
    inherently convey geographical information about their relative positions north
    or south of one another. However, it is generally understood that zip codes can
    be mapped to specific locations. In this case, 30332 is associated with Atlanta,
    Georgia, and 90274 is associated with Palos Verdes Peninsula, California. When
    mapped, Atlanta, GA, is indeed geographically located to the north of Palos Verdes
    Peninsula, CA. Therefore, the question can be interpreted as asking for a comparison
    of the latitudinal positions of these two locations, which allows for a clear
    answer based on geographic data.
  - The question asks if zip code 30332 in Georgia is located south of zip code 90274
    in California. The question is straightforward in its request for a geographic
    comparison based on latitude. However, the ambiguity arises because zip codes
    are not typically associated with geographic directionality or distance in a direct
    manner, and understanding the question requires external knowledge about the specific
    locations of these zip codes. Additionally, zip codes are not inherently designed
    to convey north-south or east-west relationships. Thus, the interpretation of
    "located south of" could be unclear without further geographical context. However,
    if interpreted strictly in terms of latitude, the question is clear in what it
    is asking.
  - The question asks whether the location of the zip code 30332 in Georgia is south
    of the location of the zip code 90274 in California. Zip codes are numerical codes
    used primarily for mail delivery purposes and do not provide information about
    geographic latitude or relative positions such as north or south. Therefore, the
    question is based on a misunderstanding of how zip codes work, as they do not
    inherently provide directional geographic information. However, if interpreted
    strictly by geographic latitude, it could be determined if one zip code area is
    geographically south of the other. Thus, the question can be interpreted in terms
    of geographic latitude comparison, making it potentially clear if interpreted
    this way. Nonetheless, the nature of zip codes does introduce some ambiguity due
    to their primary purpose not being geographic location indicators.
  - The question asks whether the location of one zip code (30332, GA) is south of
    another zip code (90274, CA). This requires understanding geographic locations

    relationship between two specific locations. Zip code 30332 is in Georgia, and
    90274 is in California. Given the geographic positions of Georgia and California,
    this question can be answered definitively by comparing the latitudes of these
    locations.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 30332 in Georgia is located south of the
    zip code 90274 in California. Zip codes are numerical codes assigned to specific
    geographic areas primarily for mail delivery purposes and do not inherently convey
    geographic information such as latitude or longitude. However, one could infer
    geographic location if the locations of the zip codes are known. In this case,
    30332 corresponds to an area in Atlanta, Georgia, and 90274 corresponds to an
    area in Palos Verdes Estates, California. Since Atlanta, GA, is geographically
    located east of and slightly north of Palos Verdes Estates, CA, the question could
    be interpreted as asking for a geographic comparison based on known locations.
    Thus, the question is clear in its intention to compare geographical locations.
    The interpretation is straightforward, as it concerns geographic latitude comparison,
    which can only be answered in one way based on the known locations of these zip
    codes.
  - The question asks whether the location associated with the zip code 30332 in Georgia
    is south of the location associated with the zip code 90274 in California. The

    and measurable concept. Since latitude lines run east-west and measure how far
    north or south a location is from the equator, the question can be answered by
    comparing the latitudes of the two locations. Therefore, this question admits
    one interpretation and one correct answer based on geographical data.

  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographical position of two specific
    zip codes in Illinois: 60514 and 60559. The interpretation of "south of" in this
    context is clear and relates to the geographical direction. The question implies
    a straightforward comparison of the two locations based on their latitude. Therefore,
    it admits one interpretation and one correct answer based on geographical data.'
  - The question is asking whether the location of one zip code (60514, IL) is south
    of another zip code (60559, IL). Zip codes are numerical and do not inherently
    indicate geographical direction or positioning. To answer this question accurately,
    one would need to reference a map or geographical data to determine the relative
    positioning of these two zip codes. However, the question itself is clear in its
    request for a geographic comparison between two specific zip codes. It does not
    admit multiple interpretations; it straightforwardly seeks to know the north-south
    relationship between two fixed points.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 60514, IL is located south of the zip code
    60559, IL. Zip codes are numerical and do not inherently indicate geographic direction
    such as north or south. However, if we interpret the question based on geographic
    location, it becomes a matter of determining the actual geographical positions
    of these zip codes in Illinois. This is generally a straightforward geographic
    question and doesn't admit multiple interpretations, as it requires factual information
    about their respective locations. Therefore, the question is clear in its intent
    to find out the relative geographic position based on known data.
  - The question asks whether one zip code (60514) is located south of another zip
    code (60559) in Illinois. Zip codes are not inherently organized in a geographical
    north-south or east-west manner; they are primarily designed for postal delivery
    efficiency. Therefore, determining the geographical direction between two zip
    codes requires specific knowledge of their locations. The question assumes a geographical
    relationship that may not be straightforward or universally understood, leading
    to potential ambiguity without additional context or specific mapping information.
    Thus, the question could be interpreted differently based on how one perceives
    the organization of zip codes.
  - The question asks whether one zip code (60514, IL) is located south of another
    zip code (60559, IL). Zip codes are numerical codes used for mail delivery and
    do not directly correlate with geographical locations in terms of cardinal directions
    like north or south. While it is possible to determine the relative geographical
    positions of these zip codes using external data (such as maps or databases),
    the question as it stands could be interpreted in more than one way. Without specifying
    the method of determining "south" (e.g., using latitude or another system), there
    is ambiguity in how to interpret and answer the question based solely on the information
    given.
  - 'The question asks whether the location of zip code 60514 in Illinois is south
    of the location of zip code 60559 in Illinois. While zip codes can give a general
    idea of location, they are not strictly sequential in terms of geography, and
    the question assumes a straightforward north-south relationship based on zip code
    numbers. However, zip codes are primarily assigned based on postal routes and
    other logistical considerations, not geographic latitude. Therefore, to accurately
    answer the question, one would need to look at a map or use a geographic information
    system to determine the actual relative locations. The question could be interpreted
    in two ways: based on a mistaken assumption about zip code numbers reflecting
    geographic positions or based on actual geographic locations. This dual interpretation
    leads to different answers: one based on the flawed assumption and one based on
    geographic data.'
  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographic location of two zip codes
    in Illinois: 60514 and 60559. The interpretation hinges on the geographic positioning
    of these zip codes, which is a matter of factual data. There is only one correct
    interpretation regarding whether one zip code is located south of the other based
    on their geographic coordinates. Therefore, the question admits only one interpretation
    and one correct answer.'
  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographic locations of two zip codes
    in Illinois: 60514 and 60559. The question is straightforward in seeking to determine
    whether one zip code is located to the south of the other. However, zip codes
    are not always arranged in a strictly geographic manner and may not follow a simple
    north-south, east-west pattern. Nonetheless, the question itself is clear in its
    request for a relative geographic orientation between two specific zip codes.'
  - The question asks whether one specific zip code, 60514, IL, is located south of
    another zip code, 60559, IL. This question implies a geographical comparison based
    on latitude. Although zip codes can be used to approximate locations, they do
    not follow a strict north-south or east-west order, which can make determining
    relative positions based solely on zip codes ambiguous. Without additional context
    or geographic data, such as a map or coordinates, the question may lead to different
    interpretations regarding what "located south of" means in this context. Therefore,
    it admits more than one interpretation regarding the methodology to determine
    the answer.
  - The question asks whether the location associated with the ZIP code 60514 in Illinois
    is south of the location associated with the ZIP code 60559 in Illinois. ZIP codes
    are numerical representations assigned to specific areas, often used for mail
    delivery, and they do not inherently convey geographical direction. The question
    assumes that ZIP codes can be directly compared for geographic directionality,
    which is not always accurate since ZIP codes are not assigned in a way that consistently
    correlates with geographic latitude or longitude. Therefore, without additional
    geographic information or context, the question could be interpreted in multiple
    ways, leading to different answers based on assumptions about ZIP code sequencing
    or knowledge of the actual locations. Thus, the question is ambiguous.

  - The question asks whether one zip code in New York (14526) is located south of
    another (14607). On the surface, this seems to be a straightforward geographical
    question. However, zip codes are not inherently geographical in order and do not
    follow a linear path from north to south. Therefore, determining whether one zip
    code is "south" of another is not a standard or clear-cut query based on zip code
    numbers alone. This requires additional context, such as specific geographical
    data about the locations of these zip codes. Without this context, the question
    is open to interpretation and could lead to different answers depending on how
    one interprets "located south of." Therefore, it is ambiguous.
  - The question is asking whether the location represented by the zip code 14526
    is south of the location represented by the zip code 14607. While it is asking
    for a geographical comparison, zip codes are not assigned based on a geographic
    north-south axis but are rather distributed based on other factors such as postal
    routes. Without specific knowledge of the geographic coordinates of these zip
    codes, one cannot definitively determine the north-south relationship purely from
    the zip codes themselves. Therefore, the question is ambiguous because it relies
    on an incorrect assumption about zip code distribution.
  - The question is asking if one US zip code (14526, NY) is located south of another
    zip code (14607, NY). While zip codes can provide some geographic information,
    they are primarily used for postal delivery rather than precise geographic location.
    Additionally, zip codes do not necessarily follow a strict north-south or east-west
    progression. Without specific geographic coordinates or a map, determining the
    relative north-south position based solely on zip codes can be challenging. Thus,
    this question could be interpreted in multiple ways, such as asking about postal
    routes, general regional location, or precise latitude comparison, each potentially
    leading to different answers.
  - The question asks whether the location of the zip code 14526 in New York is south
    of the location of the zip code 14607 in New York. This question might seem straightforward,
    but the interpretation can be ambiguous because zip codes are not always assigned
    in a strictly geographical manner. Additionally, without specific latitude or
    geographical data associated with each zip code, the question could have different
    answers depending on how the locations are determined. Therefore, without additional
    context or a defined method for determining "south of," the question could lead
    to multiple interpretations.
  - The question asks whether the location corresponding to the zip code 14526 in
    New York is south of the location corresponding to the zip code 14607 in New York.
    While zip codes can generally be used to identify specific geographic areas, they
    do not inherently provide information about latitude or precise geographic orientation.
    Thus, determining whether one zip code is geographically south of another requires
    additional geographic data or context not provided in the question itself. The
    interpretation of "south" could depend on specific mapping data or local knowledge,
    leading to potential ambiguity in answering the question without additional information.
  - The question is asking whether one zip code (14526, NY) is located south of another
    zip code (14607, NY). The interpretation of "south" in this context is geographical,
    referring to the relative north-south positioning of the two locations. Zip codes
    are numerical codes assigned to specific geographical areas, but they do not inherently
    convey directional or positional information about their location relative to
    one another. Therefore, to answer this question accurately, one would need to
    know the specific geographical coordinates or map positions of the two zip codes.
    The question is clear in its intent and does not admit multiple interpretations;
    it asks for a straightforward geographical comparison between two specific locations.
  - The question asks if one US zip code (14526, NY) is located south of another zip
    code (14607, NY). While zip codes can provide a general idea of location, they
    do not directly correspond to geographic coordinates like latitude or longitude.
    Without additional geographic information, such as a map or GPS data, the question
    could be interpreted in different ways. The zip codes themselves do not inherently
    provide enough information to determine which is geographically south of the other.
    Therefore, the question could be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the
    context or additional data provided.
  - The question is asking whether one US zip code (14526) is located south of another
    zip code (14607). The interpretation of "south" could relate to geographic positioning
    in terms of latitude or it could refer to general regional positioning, which
    might not strictly follow geographic latitude due to the irregular shapes of zip
    code boundaries. However, zip codes are assigned in a way that generally follows
    geographic progression, and they do not change frequently. Given that zip codes
    are numeric and generally increase from east to west and north to south in the
    eastern United States, this question is likely asking about the geographic latitude
    of these two zip codes. Therefore, the question has a clear interpretation based
    on geographic latitude and admits a single correct answer based on mapping data.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographical location of two specific
    zip codes, 14526 and 14607, in New York. The interpretation seems straightforward:
    it is asking whether the location associated with zip code 14526 is south of the
    location associated with zip code 14607. This question can be answered by looking
    at a map or using geographical data. There is no indication that the question

  - The question asks whether one zip code (14526, NY) is located south of another
    zip code (14607, NY). Zip codes are primarily used for mail delivery purposes
    and do not inherently provide geographic or directional information. Without a
    specific reference to a map or geographic coordinates, interpreting zip codes
    as directional indicators is not straightforward. Additionally, zip codes can
    vary widely in area and shape, making it difficult to determine precise north-south
    positioning based solely on zip code numbers. As a result, the question is ambiguous
    because it relies on interpreting zip codes in a way that they are not designed
    for, leading to potential multiple interpretations regarding geographic positioning.

  - 'The question asks about the relative location of two zip codes in New York: 11507
    and 10021. However, the question is ambiguous because zip codes do not inherently
    provide clear geographical information regarding north-south orientation. Without
    specific geographical data or a map reference, it''s unclear how to determine
    if one zip code is geographically south of the other. Additionally, zip codes
    can be non-contiguous and do not necessarily follow a linear geographical pattern.'
  - 'The question is asking about the relative location of two ZIP codes in New York:
    11507 and 10021. This question can be interpreted in different ways because "south"
    could refer to geographic latitude, postal service areas, or even local neighborhood
    perceptions. Additionally, ZIP codes are not strictly organized by geographic
    latitude, making the question potentially ambiguous. Therefore, without a specific
    context or clarification on the criteria for determining "south," the question
    could lead to different interpretations and answers.'
  - The question asks whether the zip code 11507 in New York is located south of the
    zip code 10021 in New York. This question is specific and asks for a geographical
    comparison between two distinct zip codes. The interpretation of the question
    is straightforward as it requires determining the relative geographical location
    of the two zip codes within New York state. Zip codes can be mapped to specific
    geographical areas, and their relative positions (north, south, east, west) can
    be determined using geographical data. Thus, there is only one interpretation
    and one correct answer to this question.
  - The question asks whether the location of the zip code 11507 in New York is south
    of the location of the zip code 10021 in New York. The interpretation of "south"
    in this context is geographic, meaning the question is about the relative latitude
    of the two zip codes. Since latitude is a measurable and definitive geographic
    coordinate, there is only one correct answer based on the actual geographic locations
    of these zip codes. Therefore, the question is clear in its intent and has a specific
    answer based on geographic data.
  - The question asks whether one location (11507, NY) is located south of another
    location (10021, NY) based on their zip codes. Zip codes themselves do not provide
    information about geographical direction or latitude. The question assumes that
    zip codes can determine north-south positioning, which is incorrect. However,
    if the question is interpreted as asking for a geographical comparison of two
    specific locations represented by these zip codes, it is clear and admits one
    answer. Therefore, the question is ultimately clear in its intent to compare the
    geographical positioning of two specific locations.
  - The question asks whether the location identified by the zip code 11507 in New
    York is south of the location identified by the zip code 10021 in New York. Zip
    codes are numerical codes used to identify specific geographic areas, and their
    order does not necessarily correspond to geographic direction such as north or
    south. Without specific geographic coordinates or a map reference, the question
    could be interpreted in terms of comparing the numerical values of the zip codes
    rather than actual geographic locations. Additionally, zip codes often cover non-linear
    geographic areas, which means they don't always follow a straightforward north-south
    pattern. Therefore, the question could be interpreted differently depending on
    how one chooses to assess the position (numerically or geographically). This makes
    the question ambiguous as it admits more than one interpretation.
  - The question is asking whether one specific zip code, 11507, is located south
    of another specific zip code, 10021, both in New York. The question is clear in
    its intent and asks for a straightforward geographical comparison based on latitude.
    Therefore, the question only admits one interpretation and one correct answer
    based on geographic data.
  - The question is asking whether one location (11507, NY) is south of another location
    (10021, NY). However, the question is ambiguous because ZIP codes do not inherently
    provide information about geographical positioning such as north or south. ZIP
    codes are primarily used for mail delivery purposes and do not follow a strict
    geographical pattern. Without additional geographical information or context,
    determining the relative positioning of ZIP codes based solely on their numbers
    is not possible. Thus, the question admits more than one interpretation and could
    lead to different answers depending on how one interprets the relationship between
    ZIP codes and geographical locations.

  - The question involves determining the geographical location of two specific zip
    codes in Pennsylvania, 19608 and 15601, to ascertain which one is located further
    south. The interpretation hinges on understanding the relative geographical positioning
    of these zip codes. The question presumes that zip codes can be directly compared
    based on their numerical order, which isn't always geographically sequential.
    Therefore, the question can be interpreted as asking for a straightforward geographical
    comparison, but the lack of context about how zip codes are organized or the expectation
    of geographical knowledge introduces potential ambiguity. However, since the question
    ultimately seeks a specific geographical comparison, it is more clear than ambiguous.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographical location of two zip codes
    in Pennsylvania: 19608 and 15601. To determine if 19608 is south of 15601, one
    would need to look up the geographical coordinates or use a map to compare the
    latitude of both locations. The interpretation of the question is straightforward,
    as it specifically asks about the relative position in terms of direction (south)
    between two fixed locations, which can be answered definitively with geographical
    data. Thus, the question admits only one interpretation and one correct answer
    based on geographical data.'
  - 'The question is asking whether the location corresponding to the ZIP code 19608
    in Pennsylvania is situated south of the location corresponding to the ZIP code
    15601 in Pennsylvania. This requires geographic knowledge of these specific ZIP
    codes. The interpretation is straightforward: it asks for a geographic comparison
    between two specific locations in terms of latitude. There is no ambiguity in
    the question as it is clear what is being asked and it admits a single correct
    interpretation and answer.'
  - The question asks if the zip code 19608 in Pennsylvania is located south of the
    zip code 15601 in Pennsylvania. This question is about geographic locations based
    on zip codes. Zip codes are assigned in a manner that generally increases numerically
    from east to west across the United States, but this does not strictly correlate
    to latitude (north-south location). However, since both zip codes are in Pennsylvania,
    we can determine their relative geographic positions using a map or database of
    zip codes. In this case, 19608 (Sinking Spring) is indeed located south of 15601
    (Greensburg) within Pennsylvania. Therefore, the question is clear with a single
    interpretation and answer based on geographic information.
  - The question asks whether one location, identified by the zip code 19608 in Pennsylvania
    (PA), is located south of another location, identified by the zip code 15601 in
    Pennsylvania. The question could be interpreted in terms of geographic latitude
    to determine which location is further south. Zip codes are not inherently geographic
    indicators, as they are primarily used for postal purposes and can be arranged
    based on factors other than geographic location. However, generally, zip codes
    can be used to infer approximate locations. The question is reasonably clear in
    asking for a geographic comparison based on latitude. Therefore, the question
    has a clear interpretation and can have a definitive answer based on geographic
    information about the specific locations identified by the zip codes.
  - The question asks whether one specific zip code in Pennsylvania (19608) is located
    south of another zip code in Pennsylvania (15601). This can be interpreted as
    asking for a geographical comparison based on latitude. Zip codes can be looked
    up to determine their corresponding cities or regions, and then one can compare
    the latitude of these regions to determine which is south of the other. Since
    the question has a specific geographic interpretation and the answer can be determined
    based on the relative latitudes of the two locations, the question admits only
    one interpretation and one correct answer.
  - The question is asking whether the location corresponding to the zip code 19608
    in Pennsylvania is located south of the location corresponding to the zip code
    15601 in Pennsylvania. While zip codes can give a general idea of location, they
    are not sequentially organized by geographic latitude, so using zip codes to determine
    north-south positioning is not straightforward. Additionally, the question does
    not specify which part of the zip code area should be considered for determining
    the direction (e.g., the center, a specific landmark, etc.). Therefore, the question
    could be interpreted in multiple ways, leading to different answers depending
    on the method used for determining the relative location.
  - The question asks whether the location corresponding to the zip code 19608 in
    Pennsylvania is south of the location corresponding to the zip code 15601 in Pennsylvania.
    The question is based on geographical locations, which can be determined using
    a map or geographical data. Zip codes are specific and unique, so they correspond
    to specific locations. Therefore, the question has one clear interpretation and
    can be answered definitively by checking the geographical positions of the two
    zip codes.
  - The question is asking whether a specific zip code (19608) in Pennsylvania is
    located south of another zip code (15601) in Pennsylvania. The question can be
    interpreted clearly in terms of geographical location. Zip codes can be used to
    determine relative locations by examining a map or using a geographic information
    system to find the latitude of each zip code. Thus, the question admits one interpretation
    and one correct answer based on geographic data.
  - The question is asking whether the location associated with the zip code 19608
    in Pennsylvania is south of the location associated with the zip code 15601, also
    in Pennsylvania. The interpretation hinges on understanding geographic locations
    based on zip codes. This question could be considered CLEAR if zip codes are assumed
    to have a specific and widely recognized geographic location. However, it could
    also be AMBIGUOUS because zip codes can cover areas that are not strictly linear
    or easily comparable in terms of north-south orientation. Additionally, without
    a clear method of determining "south" in the context of the specific zip code
    boundaries, the question could be interpreted differently. Therefore, the question
    can be seen as having more than one interpretation regarding how to compare these
    locations geographically.

  - The question asks whether the location with the zip code 71341 in Louisiana (LA)
    is located south of the location with the zip code 76513 in Texas (TX). While
    this question seems straightforward, it is ambiguous because it does not specify
    the criteria for "south" (e.g., geographic center of the zip code area, the southernmost
    point, etc.). Additionally, zip codes do not always follow a strict geographic
    order, and without specific coordinates or a map reference, multiple interpretations
    of "south" can exist.
  - The question asks whether the location of the zip code 71341 in Louisiana (LA)
    is south of the zip code 76513 in Texas (TX). The question is clear in its requirement

  - The question asks whether a specific zip code in Louisiana (71341) is located
    south of a specific zip code in Texas (76513). The interpretation hinges on the
    geographical locations of these zip codes. Zip codes themselves do not inherently
    indicate geographical direction; they are primarily for postal routing. However,
    since the question specifies particular locations (Louisiana and Texas), it can
    be interpreted as asking for a geographical comparison between the two locations.
    Given that Louisiana is generally east of Texas and the zip code in Louisiana
    could logically be south of the one in Texas, this question admits a singular
    interpretation based on geographical location, assuming the reader understands
    the context of U.S. geography. Therefore, it is asking for a factual comparison
    of the latitude of two locations, which has a clear answer.
