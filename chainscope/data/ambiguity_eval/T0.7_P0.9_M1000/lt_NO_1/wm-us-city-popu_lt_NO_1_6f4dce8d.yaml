  - The question asks for a comparison of the population sizes of Boyden, IA, and
    White Mills, PA. The question is straightforward in its request to determine which
    city is less populous. It does not contain any language or context that suggests
    multiple interpretations or requires additional information beyond demographic
    data. Therefore, it admits one interpretation and one correct answer based on
    population statistics.
  - The question compares the population of Boyden, Iowa, with White Mills, Pennsylvania.
    To determine if the question is clear or ambiguous, we need to assess whether
    the question admits multiple interpretations. The question is straightforward
    in asking which city has a smaller population, requiring specific population data
    for a single point in time to answer. However, the question could be considered
    ambiguous if there are multiple locations named White Mills, PA, or if there are
    different time frames being considered for population data. Assuming there is
    only one White Mills in Pennsylvania and the population data refers to the most
    recent census or estimate, the question would be clear. Without additional context,
    it's unclear if there are multiple White Mills or different data sets being referenced.
    Given these potential ambiguities, the question does not strictly meet the criteria
    for being clear.
  - The question is asking for a comparison between the populations of Boyden, Iowa,
    and White Mills, Pennsylvania. The question is straightforward and aims to determine
    which of the two cities has a smaller population. However, the ambiguity arises
    from the lack of readily available or clear population data for these specific
    locations, especially since White Mills is an unincorporated community and not
    a city, making it difficult to find accurate population data. This could lead
    to different interpretations or difficulties in finding a definitive answer based
    on available resources.
  - The question asks whether Boyden, IA is less populous than White Mills, PA. This
    is a straightforward comparison of the population sizes of two specific locations.
    Assuming that accurate and up-to-date population data is available for both Boyden,
    IA and White Mills, PA, the question has only one interpretation and can be answered
    definitively based on that data.
  - 'The question asks for a comparison of population sizes between two specific locations:
    Boyden, IA, and White Mills, PA. It implies a straightforward comparison of population
    data. However, the ambiguity arises because there might be multiple places named
    White Mills in Pennsylvania or the data might not be readily available, leading
    to different interpretations of which locations are being compared or the source
    of data being used. Additionally, the question does not specify the time frame
    for the population data, which could also lead to variations in answers if the
    populations have changed over time.'
  - 'The question asks for a comparison of the population sizes of two specific locations:
    Boyden, IA, and White Mills, PA. However, it does not specify which source or
    year of population data should be used, leading to potential ambiguity if different
    data sets or years are considered. This could result in different answers depending
    on the interpretation of the data source and time frame to be used.'
  - The question asks for a comparison of the populations of Boyden, Iowa, and White
    Mills, Pennsylvania. It is clear in its request for a specific piece of information
    regarding population sizes. There are no multiple interpretations of what is being
    asked; it simply requires demographic data to answer. Therefore, the question
    is straightforward and not open to different interpretations.

  - The question is asking for a comparison of population sizes between Tracy City,
    TN, and Walla Walla East, WA. The query seems straightforward in wanting to know
    which city has a smaller population. However, the potential ambiguity arises from
    the naming of "Walla Walla East, WA," which could be interpreted as either a specific
    part of Walla Walla, WA, or a mistaken name for the city of Walla Walla, WA. This
    ambiguity in the naming could lead to different interpretations and answers depending
    on whether one considers "Walla Walla East" as a separate entity or as part of
    the city of Walla Walla.
  - The question asks for a comparison of the population sizes between Tracy City,
    TN and Walla Walla East, WA. However, "Walla Walla East, WA" is not a commonly
    recognized city or census-designated place, which makes the question ambiguous.
    It is unclear whether the question refers to a specific part of the city of Walla
    Walla, WA, or is incorrectly naming a location. This ambiguity means that there
    could be different interpretations of what "Walla Walla East, WA" refers to, potentially
    leading to different answers depending on the interpretation. Therefore, the question
    does not have a clear, singular answer.
  - 'The question is asking for a comparison of population sizes between two places:
    Tracy City, TN, and Walla Walla East, WA. The ambiguity arises from the mention
    of "Walla Walla East, WA," which is not a commonly recognized city or census-designated
    place. It could be interpreted as a part of Walla Walla, WA, or a neighborhood,
    which makes it unclear what specific population data should be considered. This
    uncertainty leads to multiple interpretations of what "Walla Walla East, WA" refers
    to, and therefore, different answers could be valid depending on the interpretation.'
  - 'The question is asking for a comparison of the population sizes of two specific
    locations: Tracy City, TN and Walla Walla East, WA. The question seems to be straightforward,
    asking whether one city is less populous than the other. However, there is a potential
    ambiguity due to the specificity of "Walla Walla East, WA," as it might not be
    a recognized distinct entity separate from Walla Walla, WA. If "Walla Walla East,
    WA" is not an officially recognized area with its own population statistics, the
    question could lead to different interpretations depending on whether one assumes
    it refers to a specific part of Walla Walla or the city as a whole. Additionally,
    population data can vary over time, and the question does not specify a particular
    timeframe for the comparison, which could also lead to different answers depending
    on the data source and date considered.'
  - The question is asking for a comparison of population sizes between Tracy City,
    TN and Walla Walla East, WA. The question seems clear in its intent, which is
    to determine whether one city is less populous than the other. However, there
    is a potential ambiguity regarding "Walla Walla East, WA." This name could refer
    to a specific part of a city or a neighborhood rather than an officially recognized
    city. Furthermore, population data might vary based on definitions or sources
    used, which adds another layer of potential ambiguity. Therefore, due to these
    possible interpretations and variabilities, the question could lead to different
    answers depending on how "Walla Walla East" is defined and what data is used.
  - The question asks for a comparison between the populations of Tracy City, TN,
    and Walla Walla East, WA. The question could be considered ambiguous because it
    lacks specificity regarding the time frame or the source of population data. Population
    figures can change over time, and different sources may report different figures.
    Without a specific reference point or dataset, the question could lead to different
    answers depending on the data used.
  - The question asks for a comparison between the populations of Tracy City, TN,
    and Walla Walla East, WA. However, there is a potential ambiguity in the question
    because "Walla Walla East, WA" may not be a well-defined or official designation
    for a city or area. If "Walla Walla East" is intended to refer to a part of Walla
    Walla, WA, or is a colloquial or unofficial name, this could lead to different
    interpretations about what specific area is being referenced. Without clear definitions
    of the areas in question, it is difficult to determine the correct answer, making
    the question ambiguous.
  - The question asks about the population comparison between Tracy City, TN, and
    Walla Walla East, WA. However, the ambiguity arises from the mention of "Walla
    Walla East, WA," as it is unclear if this refers to an official or distinct area
    within or near Walla Walla, WA, since it is not a commonly recognized separate
    entity. This lack of clarity could lead to different interpretations of what population
    data to use for comparison.
  - The question asks for a comparison of the populations of Tracy City, TN and Walla
    Walla East, WA. However, there is ambiguity in the identification of "Walla Walla
    East, WA." There is a city named Walla Walla in Washington, but "Walla Walla East"
    is not a commonly recognized or official name for a location. This could lead
    to different interpretations, such as whether it refers to a specific part of
    Walla Walla or if it is a mistaken reference. Without a clear definition or official
    recognition of "Walla Walla East," the question cannot be definitively answered.
  - The question asks whether Tracy City, TN is less populous than Walla Walla East,
    WA. However, there are ambiguities in the question. First, "Walla Walla East,
    WA" is not a well-known or established city designation; it could refer to a specific
    part of Walla Walla, WA, or might be an incorrect or informal name. Furthermore,
    the question assumes the availability of current population data, which may not
    be consistent or easily accessible. These factors introduce multiple interpretations
    regarding what exactly is being compared and based on what data.

  - The question asks for a comparison of the population size between Willis, TX,
    and Bangor Base, WA. This appears to be a straightforward question about population
    sizes. However, the ambiguity arises from the reference to "Bangor Base, WA,"
    which could refer to a specific military base rather than a recognized city or
    town. Additionally, population data for military bases might not be readily available
    or comparable to that of cities. This introduces ambiguity because the interpretation
    of what constitutes "Bangor Base, WA" in terms of population could vary, leading
    to different answers depending on the data source or interpretation of the location.
    Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation due to the potential
    confusion over the specific entity being referenced by "Bangor Base, WA."
  - The question asks for a comparison of population sizes between Willis, TX, and
    Bangor Base, WA. This is a straightforward request for factual information based
    on population statistics. It does not present multiple interpretations, as it

  - 'The question asks for a comparison of the populations between two specific places:
    Willis, TX and Bangor Base, WA. This appears to be a straightforward question
    comparing the populations of two locations. However, the ambiguity arises from
    the term "Bangor Base, WA," which could refer to the Bangor Naval Base, a military
    installation, rather than a civilian city or town. Typically, population comparisons
    involve cities or towns, not military bases, which may not have a publicly available
    population figure in the same way a city would. Furthermore, if "Bangor Base"
    is meant to refer to a nearby city or town (such as Bangor, WA), that would lead
    to a different interpretation of the question. Therefore, due to these possible
    interpretations, the question is ambiguous.'
  - The question asks whether Willis, TX is less populous than Bangor Base, WA. The
    question is specific about comparing the populations of two distinct locations,
    Willis, Texas and Bangor Base, Washington. However, it might be considered ambiguous
    because Bangor Base is not a city but a census-designated place (CDP), primarily
    known for its naval base, and may not have a clearly defined population separate
    from its military personnel. Additionally, there might be variations in population
    data sources, such as different census years or estimates, which could lead to
    varying answers. Furthermore, the term "less populous" could be interpreted based
    on different population metrics (e.g., resident population vs. daytime population).
    These factors introduce ambiguity in interpreting and answering the question.
  - 'The question is asking for a comparison of population sizes between two specific
    locations: Willis, TX, and Bangor Base, WA. However, there is ambiguity in the
    interpretation of "Bangor Base, WA." Bangor Base could refer to a specific military
    base, which typically doesn''t have a population in the same sense as a city,
    or it could refer more broadly to the area around the base. Additionally, military
    bases often have fluctuating populations due to deployments and assignments, making
    it unclear how one would define or measure its "population" for comparison purposes.
    This leads to potential different interpretations of what is meant by "Bangor
    Base, WA" in terms of population, resulting in ambiguity in the question.'

    if population sizes have changed over time.
  - 'The question asks whether Effort, PA is less populous than Thruston, KY. It is
    a straightforward comparison of population sizes between two specific locations.
    The interpretation is clear: the question is inquiring about the population sizes
    of these two places to determine which is smaller. There is only one correct answer
    based on the available population data, thus admitting only one interpretation.'
  - The question asks whether Effort, PA is less populous than Thruston, KY. This
    seems to be a straightforward comparison of population sizes between two specific
    locations. However, the ambiguity arises from the lack of widely available and
    specific population data for these places, as they may not be well-known cities
    or towns. Without clear population data, different sources might provide different
    figures or estimations, leading to potential discrepancies in answers. Additionally,
    the names "Effort" and "Thruston" could potentially refer to different places
    if they are not uniquely identified, adding another layer of ambiguity.
  - This question is AMBIGUOUS because it involves a comparison between two places
    that may not be well-documented or widely recognized, leading to potential variability
    in available data. Additionally, the question assumes that both places are consistently
    defined and recorded in terms of population, which may not be the case. Without
    clear and definitive population data for both Effort, PA and Thruston, KY, the
    question allows for multiple interpretations and sources, possibly yielding different
    answers.

  - 'The question asks for a comparison of the populations of two places: Merrill,
    WI, and Fort Stewart, GA. However, there is a potential ambiguity here because
    Fort Stewart, GA, is primarily known as a military installation rather than a
    conventional city or town. This could lead to different interpretations of what
    population figures to consider. Should the population of the military base itself
    be considered, or the surrounding area? Additionally, the question does not specify
    the time frame for the population data, which could further affect the answer.
    These factors introduce ambiguity in determining which populations to compare.'
  - 'The question asks for a comparison of the population sizes of two specific locations:

    There is no indication of any other interpretation or ambiguity in the phrasing.
    Thus, the question admits only one interpretation and seeks a specific answer
    based on population data.'
  - The question asks about the population comparison between Merrill, WI, and Fort
    Stewart, GA. However, it is ambiguous due to the fact that Fort Stewart, GA, is
    a U.S. Army post and not a city, which makes it unclear whether the question refers
    to the military base population or some surrounding area that might be considered
    a city. This ambiguity leads to different interpretations and potentially different
    answers depending on how Fort Stewart is defined or understood in the context
    of the question.
  - "The question asks about the population comparison between Merrill, WI, and Fort\

    \ definition of what is meant by \"Fort Stewart,\" the question could have different\
    \ answers based on which interpretation is used."
  - The question asks whether Merrill, WI is less populous than Fort Stewart, GA.
    This question is based on a comparison of population sizes between two specific
    locations. However, it presents an issue of ambiguity because Fort Stewart, GA,
    is primarily known as a military installation rather than a city. This could lead
    to different interpretations, such as comparing the population of Merrill, WI
    with the population of the Fort Stewart military installation itself or with the
    population of a nearby city. Additionally, population data can vary depending
    on the source and the year in which it was collected. These factors contribute
    to the ambiguity of the question.
  - The question is asking for a comparison between the populations of Merrill, WI,
    and Fort Stewart, GA. However, Fort Stewart is primarily known as a military base
    rather than a city, which introduces ambiguity. If the question intends to compare
    the population of the city associated with Fort Stewart (possibly Hinesville,
    GA, which is near the base), then it could be interpreted differently. This ambiguity
    in what constitutes "Fort Stewart, GA" in terms of population makes the question
    open to multiple interpretations.
  - The question "Is Merrill, WI less populous than Fort Stewart, GA?" appears to
    be straightforward at first glance, as it is asking for a comparison between the
    populations of two specific locations. However, there is an ambiguity present
    due to the mention of "Fort Stewart, GA." Fort Stewart is primarily known as a
    U.S. Army installation rather than a city or town, and it doesn't have a civilian
    population in the same way a city like Merrill, WI does. This could lead to different
    interpretations regarding whether to consider the population of the military personnel
    stationed there, any family members living on base, or the nearest civilian town.
    Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation, which could lead
    to different answers depending on how one interprets "Fort Stewart, GA."
  - 'The question asks whether Merrill, WI is less populous than Fort Stewart, GA.
    The question is structured to compare the population sizes of two specific locations:
    Merrill, WI and Fort Stewart, GA. While the question is straightforward in asking
    for a comparison of population sizes, it could be considered ambiguous due to
    potential issues with identifying the correct Fort Stewart, GA, as it is primarily
    a military installation rather than a city or town. Additionally, population data
    for a military base might not be as straightforward to compare with that of a
    city. Despite these potential ambiguities, the intent of the question is clear:
    it seeks to compare population sizes. However, due to the nature of the locations
    being compared, the question could admit multiple interpretations based on how
    one interprets "population" in the context of a military base.'
  - 'The question asks for a comparison of the population sizes of two specific locations:
    Merrill, WI, and Fort Stewart, GA. However, Fort Stewart is primarily a military
    installation and not a city or town, which makes the comparison ambiguous. If
    interpreted as comparing the population of the city of Merrill to the military
    base of Fort Stewart, the answer could vary based on whether you consider the
    transient population of the base or an associated nearby city. Thus, the question
    admits more than one interpretation and could lead to different answers.'
  - 'The question asks whether the city of Merrill, WI is less populous than Fort
    Stewart, GA. The question is relatively clear in that it seeks a comparison of
    population sizes between two specific locations. However, there is an ambiguity
    regarding Fort Stewart, GA, as Fort Stewart is primarily known as a U.S. Army
    installation rather than a city. This could lead to different interpretations:
    one might consider the population of the military base itself, while another might
    try to find a nearby city or consider the population of the area designated as
    Fort Stewart. This ambiguity in the reference to Fort Stewart makes it difficult
    to provide a single definitive answer without further specification.'

  - The question asks whether the city of Alex, Oklahoma is less populous than the
    city of Randall, Minnesota. At first glance, this seems straightforward. However,
    there are multiple ambiguities. Firstly, the names "Alex" and "Randall" could
    refer to different locations, as there may be multiple cities or towns with these
    names in the United States. Secondly, "OK" and "MN" are assumed to be state abbreviations
    for Oklahoma and Minnesota, respectively, but this relies on correct interpretation.
    Lastly, without additional context or specific data, the population comparison
    cannot be definitively answered. These factors introduce ambiguity in determining
    which locations are being referenced and what the actual populations are.
  - 'The question is asking for a comparison of the population sizes of two specific

  - The question asks whether the city of Alex in Oklahoma is less populous than the
    city of Randall in Minnesota. The query seems to be about comparing the populations
    of two specific cities. However, the ambiguity arises from the fact that there
    is no widely known city named "Alex" in Oklahoma or "Randall" in Minnesota. Without
    further context or clarification about these locations, such as whether they are
    small towns, neighborhoods, or otherwise, the question is ambiguous. Additionally,
    the lack of official recognition or documentation for these places makes it difficult
    to provide a definitive answer about their populations. Therefore, the question
    admits more than one interpretation, as it is unclear whether the question refers
    to real, recognized locations or perhaps fictional or lesser-known areas.

    Gloucester City, NJ, and Bridgeton, MO. However, there is ambiguity in the question
    due to the reference to "Bridgeton, MO." There is a known city named Bridgeton
    in Missouri, but the question does not specify if this is the correct city being
    referenced. Without clear context or additional information, it is difficult to
    determine whether the question is comparing the correct locations, leading to
    potential multiple interpretations and answers.'
  - 'The question asks for a comparison of the population sizes of two cities: Gloucester
    City in New Jersey and Bridgeton in Missouri. However, the question is ambiguous
    because there is no city named Bridgeton in Missouri. There is a Bridgeton in
    New Jersey and a Bridgeton in Missouri, but the context here seems confused. This
    could lead to different interpretations: one might assume the intended comparison
    is between Gloucester City, NJ, and Bridgeton, NJ, or between Gloucester City,
    NJ, and Bridgeton, MO. Without clarification on which Bridgeton is being referred
    to, the question can lead to different answers based on the city being considered.'
  - "The question asks for a comparison of the population sizes of two specific cities:\

  - The question asks whether Gloucester City, NJ, is less populous than Bridgeton,
    MO. The potential ambiguity arises from the reference to "Bridgeton, MO." It is
    possible that "Bridgeton, MO" could be a mistake or confusion with another city,
    such as "Bridgeton, NJ," which is a known city. If "Bridgeton, MO" is incorrect
    or not a well-known city, it may be challenging to provide a clear answer. Additionally,
    population figures can change over time, which could also affect the interpretation
    of the question depending on the timeframe considered.

  - This question is AMBIGUOUS because it relies on specific population data for two
    locations that may not be well-documented or could change over time. Additionally,
    the names of the places (Alleghenyville, PA and Union Bridge, MD) might refer
    to small communities or unincorporated areas, leading to potential confusion or
    difficulty in finding accurate and current population statistics. Without specific
    data or context, the question cannot be definitively answered as it stands.
  - The question asks for a comparison between the populations of Alleghenyville,
    PA, and Union Bridge, MD. This is a straightforward comparison, as it involves
    two specific locations and a single parameter (population). The question does

  - 'The question asks for a comparison of population sizes between two specific locations:
    Alleghenyville, PA and Union Bridge, MD. On the surface, it seems straightforward,
    as it asks which of the two is less populous. However, the ambiguity arises from
    the fact that Alleghenyville, PA is not an incorporated city or town and may not
    have official population statistics readily available, unlike Union Bridge, MD,
    which is an incorporated town with official census data. This could lead to different
    interpretations based on the availability and reliability of data for Alleghenyville,
    PA, making it difficult to provide a single correct answer.'

  - The question asks for a comparison of the populations of Walton Park, NY, and
    Fort Defiance, AZ. However, the question is ambiguous because it lacks context
    and specificity. There may be multiple places named Walton Park or Fort Defiance,
    and without additional information, it's unclear which specific locations are
    being referred to. Moreover, the population data could change over time, and without
    a specific timeframe, the comparison might yield different answers depending on
    when the data is considered.
  - The question asks whether Walton Park, NY is less populous than Fort Defiance,
    AZ. To determine if the question is clear or ambiguous, we need to consider whether
    the locations and their population figures are well-defined and accessible. Both
    Walton Park, NY and Fort Defiance, AZ are specific locations; however, Walton
    Park is a hamlet in Orange County, New York, and Fort Defiance is a census-designated
    place in Arizona. Depending on the source of population data or the specific boundaries
    considered, the populations might vary, leading to different interpretations.
    Therefore, without a clear definition of boundaries and sources, the question

    to a central area within a county rather than a specific town or city. Additionally,
    without specifying what is meant by "County Center" (e.g., the administrative
    center of a particular county in Virginia), it is difficult to provide a definitive
    population comparison. Similarly, "Dorr, MI" might not refer to an incorporated

    could lead to confusion about the exact location being referred to. It might be
    a name for a part of a city or a local designation that is not widely known. Similarly,
    Dorr, MI is an unincorporated community, which might not have easily accessible
    population data. The ambiguity arises from the lack of clarity about the precise

    because "Sawgrass, FL" is not a recognized city or census-designated place, which
    could lead to confusion or multiple interpretations about what specific area is
    being referred to. There is a Sawgrass area in Florida, but it is primarily known
    as a commercial area (Sawgrass Mills) rather than a residential one. Therefore,

    recognized as "US cities," which may not be accurate or universally agreed upon.
    Sawgrass, FL, is a community and not an incorporated city, while Mount Ephraim,
    NJ, is a borough. The ambiguity arises from the classification of these locations
    as "cities" and the potential need for clarification on whether the comparison
    should be based on official city status, geographic boundaries, or another criterion.
    Additionally, the population data could vary depending on the source and time
    of the data collection.'
  - The question asks about the population comparison between Sawgrass, FL, and Mount
    Ephraim, NJ. However, Sawgrass, FL, is not a recognized city or town, which makes
    it difficult to determine its population. Without a clear definition of what "Sawgrass,
    FL" refers to, the question becomes ambiguous. It could refer to a neighborhood,
    a subdivision, or another entity within a larger city, but without further clarification,
    it admits multiple interpretations. In contrast, Mount Ephraim, NJ, is a recognized
    borough. The lack of clarity about what "Sawgrass, FL" specifically refers to
    makes the question ambiguous.
  - 'The question is asking for a comparison of the population between Sawgrass, FL,
    and Mount Ephraim, NJ. The question assumes there are two distinct places: Sawgrass
    in Florida and Mount Ephraim in New Jersey. However, "Sawgrass, FL" is ambiguous
    because there is no city officially named Sawgrass in Florida; Sawgrass might
    refer to a region, a community, or a development area, such as Sawgrass Mills
    in Sunrise, FL. Without a clear definition of what "Sawgrass, FL" refers to, it''s
    difficult to provide a definitive answer. On the other hand, Mount Ephraim, NJ,
    is a recognized borough. The ambiguity lies in the lack of specificity and recognition
    of "Sawgrass, FL" as a defined geographic entity. Therefore, the question can
    lead to different interpretations based on what "Sawgrass, FL" is considered to
    be.'
  - The question is asking for a comparison of population sizes between Sawgrass,
    FL, and Mount Ephraim, NJ. However, the question is ambiguous because "Sawgrass,
    FL" is not clearly defined as an official city or town; it might refer to a neighborhood
    or area within a larger city, such as Sunrise, FL, where the Sawgrass Mills mall
    is located. Additionally, the population of such areas might not be distinctly
    available or comparable to that of Mount Ephraim, NJ, which is a recognized borough.
    The lack of clarity in defining "Sawgrass, FL" leads to multiple interpretations
    of what specific area is being referred to, thus affecting the comparability of
    population data.
  - The question asks for a comparison between the populations of Sawgrass, FL, and
    Mount Ephraim, NJ. However, there is an ambiguity in the question due to the fact
    that Sawgrass, FL, is not a recognized city or census-designated place. It is

    because there isn''t a widely recognized city or town with that name in Florida;
    Sawgrass is more commonly known as a census-designated place or a community within
    a larger area. This ambiguity in the geographic reference could lead to different
    interpretations about what area is being compared, and consequently, different
    population data might be considered. In contrast, Mount Ephraim, NJ is a clearly
    defined borough in New Jersey. The ambiguity about the specific location and definition
    of "Sawgrass, FL" makes the question open to interpretation, leading to potential
    differences in answers based on what is considered as Sawgrass, FL.'
  - 'The question asks for a comparison of the populations of two specific locations:

  - The question compares the population of Bluewell, West Virginia, with the population
    of Slippery Rock University, Pennsylvania. The potential ambiguity arises from
    the comparison between a geographic location (Bluewell) and an institution (Slippery
    Rock University). It is unclear if the question intends to compare the population
    of Bluewell with the student population of Slippery Rock University or another
    population-related metric of the university. Without a specific interpretation,
    the question could lead to different answers depending on which population metric
    is being considered.
  - The question is asking for a comparison of population between Bluewell, WV, and
    Slippery Rock University, PA. However, there is an ambiguity because Slippery
    Rock University is an institution, not a city or a town. It is unclear whether
    the question is asking for a comparison between the population of Bluewell, WV,
    and the student population of Slippery Rock University, or if it mistakenly refers
    to the town of Slippery Rock, PA, where the university is located. These different
    interpretations could lead to different answers.
  - The question asks whether Bluewell, WV, is less populous than Slippery Rock University,
    PA. However, there is ambiguity in the comparison. Bluewell, WV, is a census-designated
    place, while Slippery Rock University, PA, is an educational institution. The
    question could be interpreted as comparing the population of Bluewell to the enrollment
    size of the university, or it might mistakenly treat the university as a geographic
    location like a city. This ambiguity in the nature of the entities being compared
    (a place vs. an institution) leads to different interpretations and potential
    answers.
  - The question asks about the population comparison between Bluewell, WV, and Slippery
    Rock University, PA. However, Slippery Rock University is an institution and not
    a city, which introduces ambiguity. The question could be interpreted as comparing
    the population of Bluewell, WV, to either the student population of Slippery Rock
    University or to the population of Slippery Rock, PA, where the university is
    located. These interpretations could lead to different answers depending on which
    population is being considered.
  - The question compares the population of Bluewell, WV, with the population of Slippery
    Rock University, PA. The ambiguity arises because it is unclear whether the comparison
    is intended to be between the population of the town of Slippery Rock, PA, or
    specifically the university campus population. Additionally, the phrase "less
    populous" can be interpreted in terms of resident population or some other measure
    of population. These factors lead to multiple interpretations of the question.
  - The question is asking for a comparison between the population of Bluewell, WV,
    and Slippery Rock University, PA. The ambiguity arises from the fact that Slippery
    Rock University is an educational institution, not a city. It is unclear whether
    the question intends to compare the population of Bluewell, WV, with the student
    enrollment at Slippery Rock University or with the population of the town of Slippery
    Rock, PA, where the university is located. This dual interpretation leads to different
    potential answers, making the question ambiguous.
  - The question asks whether Bluewell, WV is less populous than Slippery Rock University,
    PA. The ambiguity arises from the comparison between a location (Bluewell, WV)
    and an institution (Slippery Rock University, PA). It is unclear whether the question
    intends to compare the population of Bluewell, WV to the student population of
    Slippery Rock University or the population of the area where the university is
    located. This lack of clarity in what is being compared leads to multiple interpretations
    and potential answers.
  - The question compares the population of Bluewell, WV, with that of Slippery Rock
    University, PA. The ambiguity arises because the question does not specify whether
    it is comparing Bluewell's population with the university's student enrollment
    or the population of the town where the university is located, Slippery Rock,
    PA. This lack of specificity leads to multiple interpretations and potential answers.
  - The question asks for a comparison of population between Bluewell, WV, and Slippery
    Rock University, PA. The ambiguity arises because Slippery Rock University is
    an institution, not a city or town, and therefore does not have a population in
    the same sense as a city does. This makes the comparison unclear. Additionally,
    the question does not specify whether it's asking about the population of the
    university itself or the town of Slippery Rock, PA, where the university is located.
  - The question is asking for a comparison of the population of Bluewell, WV, which
    is a census-designated place, with the student population of Slippery Rock University,
    PA. The ambiguity arises because "Slippery Rock University, PA" could refer either
    to the university itself or to the town of Slippery Rock, PA, where the university
    is located. Depending on this interpretation, the comparison could be between
    the population of Bluewell and either the student population of the university
    or the total population of the town. This leads to different possible answers,
    hence the question admits more than one interpretation.

    have an official population to compare with Danube, MN. Additionally, without
    specific population data or a defined scope of what constitutes Yonah, GA, the
    question might not yield a clear answer. However, if both locations are recognized
    and have available population data, the question would be clear.'
  - 'The question asks for a comparison of the population sizes of two locations:

    not a well-defined location. "Yonah" could refer to Yonah Mountain, which is a
    geographic feature rather than a city or town, or it could be a less formally
    recognized area within Georgia. Without clarity on what "Yonah, GA" specifically
    refers to, the question admits multiple interpretations, making it difficult to
    provide a definitive answer. Additionally, if "Yonah, GA" is indeed a recognized
    area, its population data might not be readily available or comparable to Danube,
    MN.'
  - 'The question asks for a comparison of the populations of two locations: Danube,
    MN and Yonah, GA. However, the question is ambiguous because "Yonah, GA" does
    not clearly refer to an established city or town, as there is no widely recognized
    city by that name in Georgia. This could lead to different interpretations depending
    on what is meant by "Yonah, GA." Without a clear understanding of what "Yonah,
    GA" refers to, the question does not admit one definitive answer.'
  - The question asks for a comparison between the populations of Danube, MN and Yonah,
    GA. However, there is ambiguity in the question because "Yonah, GA" is not a recognized
    city or town. There is a Mount Yonah in Georgia, but no city by that name, which
    creates uncertainty about what is being compared. Additionally, the question does
    not specify a time frame for the population comparison, which could affect the
    answer if population data changes over time.
  - 'The question is asking for a comparison of the population sizes of two specific

    there is ambiguity because "Yonah, GA" is not widely recognized as a city or town.
    Yonah could refer to a mountain or other geographic feature, not a population
    center, which makes the question unclear. Without definitive information on Yonah
    as a populated area, the question cannot be answered definitively.'
  - The question asks whether Danube, MN is less populous than Yonah, GA. It appears
    to be a straightforward comparison of the populations of two specific locations.
    However, the ambiguity arises because Yonah, GA is not a recognized city or town,
    but rather a geographical feature (Yonah Mountain) in Georgia. This makes the
    question ambiguous as it is unclear whether it refers to a specific populated
    place in Georgia or if there has been a misunderstanding or error in naming a
    city. Without a clear and recognized place to compare, the question admits more
    than one interpretation and could lead to different answers based on assumptions
    or additional context that is not provided.
  - 'The question asks for a comparison of the populations of two specific locations:
    Danube, MN, and Yonah, GA. It appears to be straightforward, but there is a potential
    ambiguity. While Danube, MN, is a known city, "Yonah, GA," is not commonly recognized
    as a city or town in Georgia. Yonah could refer to Yonah Mountain or other geographical
    features or lesser-known areas, leading to different interpretations of what "Yonah,
    GA" represents. This uncertainty in identifying Yonah makes the question ambiguous,
    as the answer depends on what specific location "Yonah, GA" refers to.'
  - 'The question is asking for a comparison between the populations of two specific

    Yonah is more commonly associated with Mount Yonah, a mountain in Georgia. This
    lack of clarity regarding what Yonah, GA refers to makes the question ambiguous,
    as it could lead to different interpretations depending on what the questioner
    intended by "Yonah, GA." Therefore, the question is classified as AMBIGUOUS because
    it can be interpreted in more than one way, affecting the answer.'
  - The question asks for a comparison of the population sizes of Danube, MN and Yonah,
    GA. It appears to be straightforward at first glance, but there are potential
    ambiguities. First, the question assumes that Yonah, GA is a city; however, Yonah
    is not a recognized city in Georgia, which leads to ambiguity about what specific
    location is being referred to. Additionally, if Yonah is meant to refer to another
    type of geographic or administrative region, the population comparison may not
    be valid without further clarification. This lack of clarity about the reference
    to Yonah makes the question ambiguous.

    \ one interpretation, which could lead to different answers."
  - The question "Is Pinewood, FL less populous than Conyers, GA?" can be classified
    as AMBIGUOUS. This is because the question does not specify the time frame or
    the sources for the population data. Population numbers can change over time,
    and different sources may report slightly different figures. Additionally, the
    question does not account for whether the comparison should be based on the most
    recent data or a specific year's data. These factors can lead to different interpretations
    and answers.
  - The question asks for a comparison between the populations of Pinewood, FL, and
    Conyers, GA. The question is straightforward in its request for a specific comparison
    of population sizes between two clearly named locations. It does not present multiple
    interpretations or require additional context to understand what is being asked.
  - The question asks about the population comparison between Pinewood, FL, and Conyers,
    GA. However, the question is ambiguous because it does not specify which Pinewood
    is being referred to, as there could be multiple places with similar names. Without
    additional context, it is unclear which specific location is meant, making it
    difficult to provide a definitive answer based on the given information.
  - The question asks about the population comparison between Pinewood, FL, and Conyers,
    GA. However, without specific data or a defined time frame, the interpretation
    could vary. Population figures can change over time, and the question does not
    specify when the comparison should be made. Additionally, the question assumes
    the existence of both locations without providing context or sources for population
    data, which can lead to different interpretations based on different data sources
    or time periods.
  - The question is asking for a comparison of population sizes between Pinewood,
    FL and Conyers, GA. While the question seems straightforward, it is ambiguous
    because "Pinewood, FL" could refer to a neighborhood or census-designated place
    rather than an official city, and its boundaries and population data might not
    be clearly defined or readily comparable to Conyers, GA, which is an incorporated
    city. Moreover, population data can vary depending on the source and the year
    of the data. Therefore, the question could lead to different interpretations based
    on these factors.
  - The question asks about the population comparison between Pinewood, FL, and Conyers,
    GA. However, the question is ambiguous because "Pinewood, FL" could refer to multiple
    places. There is a Census Designated Place (CDP) named Pinewood in Miami-Dade
    County, Florida, but without specifying which Pinewood is being referred to, it
    could lead to different interpretations. Additionally, population figures can
    change over time, so the answer might differ depending on the specific data or
    time frame considered.
  - 'The question asks whether Pinewood, FL is less populous than Conyers, GA. To
    classify this, we need to consider the clarity and specificity of the question.
    The question specifically mentions two locations: Pinewood, FL and Conyers, GA,
    and asks for a comparison of their populations. There is only one interpretation
    of this question, which is to compare the population sizes of these two specific
    places. The answer can be obtained by looking up the population data for each
    location. Thus, the question is specific and admits only one interpretation and
    answer based on the available population data.'
  - The question asks for a comparison between the populations of Pinewood, FL, and
    Conyers, GA. The question is clear in its request for a population comparison
    between two specific locations. However, Pinewood, FL, might not be well-known
    or officially recognized as a city, which could lead to ambiguity in finding accurate
    population data. Similarly, Conyers, GA, is a small city, and variations in data
    sources might lead to different interpretations of what constitutes the "population"
    of these areas. Therefore, the question might lead to different answers based
    on the interpretation of what Pinewood, FL, refers to and the data sources used
    for population figures.
  - The question asks for a comparison of the population sizes between Pinewood, FL
    and Conyers, GA. While the question seems straightforward, it could be considered
    ambiguous for a couple of reasons. First, there might be different datasets or
    years being referenced for population data, leading to different answers depending
    on the source or timeframe considered. Second, if there is any confusion regarding
    the specific locations being referred to (e.g., if there are multiple places named
    Pinewood), this could also lead to ambiguity. However, assuming the question refers
    to the most recent and reliable population data for these specific locations,
    the question could be answered clearly. Overall, without additional context, the
    question admits more than one interpretation.

    comparison of population sizes. The question is clear in its intent and seeks
    a factual answer based on population data. There is no indication of multiple
    interpretations or contexts that could lead to different answers.
  - The question asks whether Mamou, LA is less populous than Tishomingo, OK. It refers
    to two specific locations and asks for a comparison of their populations. However,
    the question could be considered ambiguous because it does not specify the time
    frame for the population data (e.g., current population, population at a specific
    census year). Without this information, the answer could vary depending on the
    data source or the time the data was collected. Therefore, the question could
    lead to different interpretations and answers based on these factors.
  - The question is asking for a comparison between the populations of Mamou, LA,
    and Tishomingo, OK. While this seems straightforward, the ambiguity arises because
    the question does not specify the time frame for the population comparison. Population

    OK. The question is specific about the locations (Mamou in Louisiana and Tishomingo
    in Oklahoma) and what is being compared (population size). The interpretation
    of the question is straightforward, as it is asking whether one city's population
    is less than the other's. The question does not imply any alternative interpretations
    or require additional context beyond the population sizes of the two specified
    cities.
  - The question asks whether Mamou, LA is less populous than Tishomingo, OK. On the
    surface, this seems straightforward, as it is asking for a direct population comparison
    between two specific locations. However, the question could be considered ambiguous
    because it does not specify the time frame for the population data. Population
    numbers can change over time due to various factors such as migration, birth rates,
    and administrative changes. Without a specified year or data source, the question
    could lead to different answers based on different data sets or years. Therefore,
    it admits more than one interpretation regarding the time of population measurement.

  - The question asks for a comparison of the population sizes between Rothschild,
    WI and Rio Pinar, FL. This appears to be a straightforward question about population
    sizes, which should have a definitive answer based on available population data
    for these locations. There is no apparent ambiguity in the phrasing or the information
    being requested, as it specifically compares the populations of two distinct locations.
  - The question asks for a comparison of population sizes between Rothschild, WI,
    and Rio Pinar, FL. It is specific about the two locations being compared and the
    criterion (population size). However, it might be ambiguous due to potential variations
    in data sources or differences in understanding what is meant by "less populous."
    Without a specific year or source for the population data, different interpretations
    could lead to different answers based on the data used.
  - The question asks for a comparison of population sizes between Rothschild, WI,
    and Rio Pinar, FL. However, the question is ambiguous because it assumes that
    the population data for these locations is readily available and comparable at
    the time of asking. Additionally, the question does not specify the time frame
    for the population data being referenced. Furthermore, Rothschild, WI, is a village,
    and Rio Pinar, FL, is a census-designated place, which can lead to differences
    in how population data is collected and reported, adding to the ambiguity.
  - 'The question asks about the population comparison between two specific locations:
    Rothschild, WI, and Rio Pinar, FL. However, it is ambiguous for a couple of reasons.
    First, "Rio Pinar, FL" is not an incorporated city but a census-designated place,
    which could lead to confusion about what areas are being compared. Secondly, the
    populations of these places can change over time, and without a specific time
    reference, the answer may vary depending on when the data is collected. Thus,
    the question can be interpreted differently based on these factors.'

    assumes that both locations are recognized as cities, which may not be accurate.
    Rothschild is a village in Wisconsin, and Rio Pinar is a census-designated place
    in Florida, not a city. Despite this, the question is clear in its request for
    a population comparison between these two locations, assuming they are both valid
    geographical entities. The interpretation is singular: it seeks to know which
    of the two has a smaller population, without introducing any other potential interpretations
    or contexts. Therefore, the question can be answered with specific population
    data for these locations.'
  - The question asks about the population comparison between Rothschild, WI, and
    Rio Pinar, FL. While the question seems straightforward, it can be considered
    ambiguous for a couple of reasons. Firstly, there might be more than one place
    named Rothschild or Rio Pinar, leading to potential confusion about which specific
    locations are being referenced. Secondly, population data can change over time,
    and without a specific date or data source provided, different answers might be
    given based on when or how the population data is collected. These factors can
    lead to different interpretations and answers.
  - The question asks about the population comparison between Rothschild, WI, and
    Rio Pinar, FL. However, there is ambiguity because the question does not specify
    the source or date for the population data, which can vary and change over time.
    Additionally, there may be multiple places with similar names, and without additional
    context, the question could lead to different interpretations and answers based
    on different data sources or points in time.
  - The question asks for a comparison of the populations of Rothschild, WI, and Rio
    Pinar, FL. This seems straightforward; however, there is a potential issue. Rothschild,
    WI, is a village in Wisconsin, but Rio Pinar, FL, is not an incorporated city
    or village; it is a census-designated place in Florida. The ambiguity arises from
    the potential misunderstanding of what constitutes a "city" in this context and
    how population figures are compared between different types of administrative
    or geographical designations. Additionally, the question does not specify a time
    frame for the population data, which could affect the answer if considering changes
    over time.
  - The question is asking for a comparison of the population sizes between Rothschild,
    WI, and Rio Pinar, FL. However, it does not specify the source or year of the
    population data to be used for comparison, which could lead to different interpretations
    depending on the data source or the time period considered. Additionally, the
    phrasing "less populous" could be interpreted in terms of current population,
    historical data, or projected future population, adding to the ambiguity.
  - This question is AMBIGUOUS due to several reasons. Firstly, it asks about the
    population of Rothschild, WI compared to Rio Pinar, FL, but does not specify the
    time frame for this comparison. Populations can change over time, so without a
    specific date or year, the question could be interpreted differently based on
    different data points. Additionally, the question assumes the existence of both
    locations as recognized entities, but depending on the context (e.g., census data,
    geographic boundaries), the interpretation of what constitutes "Rothschild, WI"
    or "Rio Pinar, FL" might vary. The question also does not specify whether it refers
    to the incorporated areas or the broader metropolitan regions, which can further
    complicate the interpretation.

  - The question is asking for a comparison between the population of La Homa, TX,
    and University of California-Santa Barbara, CA. The ambiguity arises from the
    fact that University of California-Santa Barbara is not a city, but an educational
    institution. The question could be interpreted as comparing the population of
    La Homa, TX, to the population of the university's campus community or the surrounding
    area, which is not clearly defined. Therefore, the question can lead to different
    interpretations and answers.
  - The question is asking for a comparison between the population of La Homa, TX
    and a location referred to as University of California-Santa Barbara, CA. The
    ambiguity arises from the fact that University of California-Santa Barbara is
    an educational institution, not a city, which makes it unclear whether the question
    intends to compare the population of La Homa, TX to the student population of
    the university, the population of the surrounding area, or something else entirely.
    Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation.
  - The question asks whether La Homa, TX is less populous than University of California-Santa
    Barbara, CA. The ambiguity arises because University of California-Santa Barbara,
    CA is not a city but a university, and it's unclear whether the question is asking
    about the population of the campus or the surrounding area (like the city of Santa
    Barbara). Additionally, comparing a city to a university campus or area is inherently
    ambiguous because it involves comparing different types of entities.
  - 'The question asks for a comparison between the population of La Homa, TX, and
    University of California-Santa Barbara, CA. However, it presents an ambiguity:
    University of California-Santa Barbara, CA is not a city but an educational institution.
    The comparison is unclear because it mixes a geographic location (La Homa, TX)
    with an institution (University of California-Santa Barbara), making the basis
    of comparison uncertain. The question could be interpreted as asking about the
    population of the areas surrounding these locations, but this is not explicitly
    stated. Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation regarding
    what is being compared (city population versus institution population or its surrounding
    area), which could lead to different answers.'
  - 'The question asks whether La Homa, TX is less populous than University of California-Santa
    Barbara, CA. However, there is ambiguity because "University of California-Santa
    Barbara, CA" refers to a university, not a city. The question seems to be comparing
    the population of a city with that of a university, which is not a typical or
    clear comparison. Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation:
    one could interpret it as asking about the population of the area surrounding
    the university, or it could be seen as a misunderstanding or misphrasing of the
    intended comparison.'
  - The question compares the population of La Homa, TX, to that of University of
    California-Santa Barbara, CA. However, there is an inherent ambiguity because
    University of California-Santa Barbara is an educational institution, not a city.
    Therefore, it's unclear whether the question intends to compare the population
    of La Homa, TX, with the student population of the university or with a different
    entity. This leads to multiple possible interpretations and answers.
  - The question is asking for a comparison of population sizes between La Homa, TX,
    and University of California-Santa Barbara, CA. The ambiguity arises because University
    of California-Santa Barbara is an educational institution and not a city, whereas
    La Homa, TX, is a census-designated place. The question seems to compare a city
    with a university, which are fundamentally different entities, leading to confusion
    about what is being compared. Thus, the question admits more than one interpretation,
    such as whether it is comparing the population of the town of La Homa with the
    student population of the university or the population of the broader area surrounding
    the university.
  - 'The question is asking to compare the population of La Homa, TX, with that of
    University of California-Santa Barbara, CA. The question is ambiguous because
    it mixes a city (La Homa, TX) with a university (University of California-Santa
    Barbara, CA). Typically, population comparisons are made between two cities, not
    a city and a university. The question could be interpreted in multiple ways: comparing
    the city of La Homa to the student population of the university or mistakenly
    considering University of California-Santa Barbara as a city. Therefore, different
    interpretations could lead to different answers.'
  - The question compares the population of La Homa, TX, with "University of California-Santa
    Barbara, CA." There is ambiguity here because the comparison is made between a
    city and a university, which are not directly comparable entities in terms of
    population. If the intention is to compare the population of La Homa with the
    population of the city where the University of California-Santa Barbara is located
    (Santa Barbara, CA), then the question should have been phrased differently. Additionally,
    it's unclear if the population being referred to is the student population of
    the university or the general population of the city. These factors make the question
    open to multiple interpretations.
  - The question is ambiguous because it compares the population of a city, La Homa,
    TX, with what seems to be an institution, University of California-Santa Barbara,
    CA. It is unclear whether the question intends to compare the population of La
    Homa, TX, with the population of the city where the university is located, with
    the student population of the university, or with something else entirely. Therefore,
    the question admits more than one interpretation and could lead to different answers.

    is not a widely recognized city name. Similarly, "Lake Norman of Catawba, NC"
    is a region around a lake that spans multiple counties and does not specify a
    single city or town. Therefore, the lack of specificity in both locations could
    lead to multiple interpretations of what areas are being compared, resulting in
    different answers depending on the interpretation.
  - 'The question asks for a comparison of the population sizes between two specific
    locations: Cascades, VA, and Lake Norman of Catawba, NC. However, the question
    is ambiguous because it is not clear what specific areas are being referred to.

    reasons. First, "Cascades, VA" might refer to an area that isn''t clearly defined
    as a city or census-designated place, which could lead to different interpretations
    of what population data should be considered. Similarly, "Lake Norman of Catawba,
    NC" might not refer to a specific city or locality, as Lake Norman is a large
    lake with surrounding communities that could be interpreted in multiple ways.
    The lack of precise definitions for these locations makes it difficult to determine
    which population data to compare, leading to potential variations in answers based
    on different interpretations.'
  - 'The question asks for a comparison of the population between two places: Cascades,

    Lake Norman, which spans multiple counties and communities. This makes it unclear
    which specific population is being compared. Additionally, "Cascades, VA" might
    refer to a census-designated place or another type of locality, which adds further
    ambiguity if not precisely defined. The lack of specificity in the geographic
    entities being compared leads to multiple possible interpretations.'
  - 'The question is asking for a comparison of population sizes between two locations:

    present. Firstly, "Cascades, VA" may refer to a census-designated place, but it
    is not widely recognized as a standalone city, which could lead to confusion about
    what specific area is being referred to. Secondly, "Lake Norman of Catawba, NC"
    is a geographic feature and not a city or town, making it unclear what specific

    a lake, not a city, and it may refer to various surrounding communities or regions,
    which could lead to different population figures. Furthermore, population data
    can vary based on the source or date, leading to different answers.
  - The question asks for a comparison of the population sizes between Cascades, VA,
