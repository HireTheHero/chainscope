  - The question is asking about the geographical location of the Sangre de Cristo
    Range in relation to the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in Colorado. The potential
    ambiguity arises from the fact that the Sangre de Cristo Range is part of the
    larger Sangre de Cristo Mountains, which could lead to confusion about whether
    the question is asking about a specific part of the range or comparing two distinct
    entities. The interpretation of "west of" also depends on the specific parts being
    compared, as the range and the mountains may overlap geographically. Therefore,
    the question admits more than one interpretation, which could lead to different
    answers based on the understanding of these terms.
  - The question asks about the relative location of the Sangre de Cristo Range and
    the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in Colorado. However, it is ambiguous because the
    term "Sangre de Cristo Mountains" can refer to the entire mountain range that
    extends from Colorado into New Mexico, whereas "Sangre de Cristo Range" typically
    refers to a specific portion of these mountains located in Colorado. The question
    could be interpreted as asking about the relationship between different parts
    of the same mountain range, which could lead to confusion about whether they are
    separate entities or not. This ambiguity in the geographic terminology used in
    the question allows for multiple interpretations.
  - The question is asking whether the Sangre de Cristo Range in Colorado is located
    west of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in Colorado. However, the Sangre de Cristo
    Range and the Sangre de Cristo Mountains are often used interchangeably to refer
    to the same mountain range, which spans from southern Colorado into northern New
    Mexico. This leads to ambiguity because it is unclear if the question is referring
    to distinct sections or if it is mistakenly treating them as separate entities.
    Therefore, the question can be interpreted in multiple ways, leading to different
    answers.
  - The question asks if the Sangre de Cristo Range in Colorado is located west of
    the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in Colorado. There could be ambiguity here because
    the Sangre de Cristo Range is actually part of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains,
    which can lead to confusion. Someone could interpret the "Sangre de Cristo Range"
    as a specific part of the mountains or as synonymous with the entire mountain
    range. This could result in different answers depending on the interpretation
    of these geographic terms.
  - The question is asking about the relative location of the Sangre de Cristo Range
    in Colorado with respect to the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in Colorado. The potential
    ambiguity arises from the fact that the "Sangre de Cristo Range" is often considered
    part of the larger "Sangre de Cristo Mountains." Therefore, interpreting whether
    the question is asking about two distinct entities or the same entity could lead
    to different answers. Additionally, the geographic orientation and naming conventions
    might not be clear, leading to further ambiguity in determining a straightforward
    answer.
  - The question involves geographic locations within Colorado, specifically the Sangre
    de Cristo Range and the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. There is potential for ambiguity
    because the terms "Sangre de Cristo Range" and "Sangre de Cristo Mountains" might
    be used interchangeably or understood differently depending on the context. Generally,
    the Sangre de Cristo Mountains are a mountain range that stretches from southern
    Colorado into northern New Mexico, and the term "Sangre de Cristo Range" could
    refer to a section of this range. However, without further context, it's unclear
    whether these terms refer to distinctly separate locations or to overlapping or
    identical areas. This ambiguity in the interpretation of geographic terms could
    lead to different answers regarding their relative positions.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative location of two geographic features:
    the Sangre de Cristo Range and the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in Colorado. However,
    the Sangre de Cristo Range is actually part of the larger Sangre de Cristo Mountains,
    which extends across both Colorado and New Mexico. This creates an ambiguity because
    the terms "Sangre de Cristo Range" and "Sangre de Cristo Mountains" could refer
    to overlapping or the same areas, depending on the context. Therefore, the question
    could lead to different interpretations regarding what specific areas are being
    compared.'
  - The question asks whether the Sangre de Cristo Range in Colorado is located west
    of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in Colorado. However, the Sangre de Cristo Range
    is a part of the larger Sangre de Cristo Mountains. This creates ambiguity because
    the question implies they might be separate entities when they are not. Therefore,
    the question can be interpreted in multiple ways, leading to potential confusion
    about the geographical relationship between the two terms.
  - 'The question asks about the relative location of two geographical features: the
    Sangre de Cristo Range and the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, both in Colorado. The
    ambiguity arises from the fact that the Sangre de Cristo Range is actually part
    of the larger Sangre de Cristo Mountains. Depending on the interpretation, one
    might consider the entire range as synonymous with the mountains or as a subset
    of the mountains. Therefore, the question could be asking about two different
    things: a comparison within the same feature (if considering the range as part
    of the mountains) or between two distinct features (if interpreting them as separate).
    This dual interpretation can lead to different answers regarding their relative
    locations.'
  - 'The question asks about the relative location of the Sangre de Cristo Range and
    the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in Colorado. The ambiguity arises from the fact
    that the "Sangre de Cristo Range" and the "Sangre de Cristo Mountains" are often

    into New Mexico. Therefore, the question could be interpreted in two ways: it
    could be asking about different parts of the same range or mistakenly treating
    them as distinct entities. This leads to different possible interpretations and
    answers, making the question ambiguous.'

  - The question asks about the relative location of Crazy Lake, CA, in relation to
    Mono Lake, CA. The question seems to assume that both locations are well-known
    and that their positions can be distinctly identified on a map. However, the ambiguity
    arises from the fact that there is no well-known "Crazy Lake" in California, making
    it unclear if the question refers to a specific location that might not be commonly
    recognized. Additionally, without specific coordinates or widely recognized names,
    the question could have multiple interpretations based on different assumptions
    about the existence and location of Crazy Lake.
  - The question asks whether Crazy Lake, CA is located west of Mono Lake, CA. The
    question implies a geographical comparison between two specific locations. However,
    there is ambiguity because "Crazy Lake, CA" is not a widely recognized or well-documented

    existence and position. Without a clear and verified location for Crazy Lake,
    CA, the question cannot be definitively answered.
  - 'The question is asking about the geographical location of Crazy Lake, CA, in
    relation to Mono Lake, CA. To determine whether the question is CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS,
    we need to consider if there is any potential for multiple interpretations or
    answers.


    The question provides specific geographical names: Crazy Lake, CA, and Mono Lake,
    CA. The interpretation hinges on the existence and recognition of both locations.
    If Crazy Lake, CA, is a well-documented and recognized place, then the question
    is straightforward and can be answered with geographical data. However, if Crazy
    Lake, CA, is not a well-known or established location, this could lead to ambiguity,
    as the question assumes its existence and specific location within California.


    Assuming both locations are recognized and documented, the question is asking
    for a simple directional relationship, which is a clear and direct query with
    one factual answer. Thus, it would be classified as CLEAR.


    If, however, Crazy Lake, CA, is ambiguous in its existence or location, then this
    question could be considered AMBIGUOUS due to the uncertainty around one of the
    key elements needed to answer it.


    Given the potential for ambiguity in the existence or recognition of Crazy Lake,
    CA, the question could be interpreted as AMBIGUOUS.'
  - The question asks about the geographical location of Crazy Lake, CA in relation
    to Mono Lake, CA. The question can be considered ambiguous for a couple of reasons.
    First, there might be multiple places known as "Crazy Lake" in California, and
    without additional context or specific details, it's unclear which Crazy Lake
    is being referred to. Second, the use of "west of" could be open to interpretation
    depending on the exact longitudinal positions, but this is secondary to the primary
    issue of not having a clearly identified location for Crazy Lake.
  - The question asks whether Crazy Lake, CA is located west of Mono Lake, CA. The
    clarity of this question hinges on the existence and location of Crazy Lake, CA.
    If Crazy Lake, CA is a well-defined and recognized location, then the question
    can be answered definitively with geographic data. However, if Crazy Lake, CA
    is not a recognized or well-documented location, or if there are multiple places
    called Crazy Lake in California, the question becomes ambiguous because it is
    unclear which location is being referred to. Without additional context or verification
    of Crazy Lake's existence and location, the question admits more than one interpretation.
  - The question asks whether Crazy Lake, CA is located west of Mono Lake, CA. The
    interpretation hinges on the specific geographic locations of Crazy Lake and Mono
    Lake. Assuming there is a single, well-defined location for each, this question

    is more than one place known as "Crazy Lake" in California or if there is ambiguity
    about its exact location, the question could lead to different answers. Without
    additional context, the question could be seen as ambiguous due to the potential
    for multiple locations named "Crazy Lake."
  - The question asks whether Crazy Lake, CA is located west of Mono Lake, CA. To

  - 'The question asks whether Crazy Lake, CA is located west of Mono Lake, CA. The
    question is clear in terms of what is being asked: the relative geographical positions
    of two specific locations. However, the question assumes the existence of a place
    named Crazy Lake in California. If Crazy Lake, CA does not exist or if there are
    multiple places with similar names, this could lead to ambiguity. Without additional
    context or verification of the existence and location of Crazy Lake, the question
    can be interpreted in different ways, making it potentially ambiguous.'

    determine if the question is clear or ambiguous, we need to consider whether there
    is only one way to interpret the geographic relationship between these two locations.
    The question is asking for a specific spatial relationship (west of), which is
    a clear criterion. The only potential ambiguity arises if there are multiple places
    named Crazy Lake, CA, or if there is any confusion about the exact locations of
    these lakes. However, assuming the question refers to a specific, known Crazy
    Lake, CA, the question itself is straightforward in its request for a directional
    comparison. Therefore, the question would be clear provided the locations are
    well-defined.
  - The question asks about the geographical location of Crazy Lake, CA in relation
    to Mono Lake, CA. It is a straightforward query about the relative positioning
    of two specific locations. However, the question is ambiguous because it assumes
    the existence and recognition of a location called "Crazy Lake, CA," which may
    not be a well-known or officially recognized place. Without clear identification
    or confirmation of Crazy Lake, CA's existence and location, the question could
    lead to different interpretations or answers, depending on different sources or
    assumptions about what "Crazy Lake" refers to.

  - The question asks whether the Northern Oregon Coast Range is located west of the
    Oregon Coast Range. The ambiguity arises because "Oregon Coast Range" is a broad
    term that refers to a series of mountain ranges along the coast of Oregon, and
    it is not clear whether the question refers to a specific part of this range or
    the entire range. Additionally, the Northern Oregon Coast Range is a subregion
    of the Oregon Coast Range, which means it is inherently a part of the broader
    range, and determining its exact orientation relative to the entire range could
    lead to different interpretations. Therefore, the question admits more than one
    interpretation regarding the geographic boundaries and orientation of these areas.
  - The question asks whether the Northern Oregon Coast Range is located west of the
    Oregon Coast Range. There is potential for ambiguity here, as "Oregon Coast Range"
    could refer to the entire range, which includes the Northern Oregon Coast Range
    as a part of it. The question does not specify which part of the Oregon Coast
    Range is being compared to its northern section, leading to possible different
    interpretations. Therefore, the question could lead to different answers depending
    on how one interprets the reference to "Oregon Coast Range."
  - The question asks whether the Northern Oregon Coast Range is located west of the
    Oregon Coast Range. The question is potentially ambiguous because the term "Oregon
    Coast Range" could refer to the entire range, of which the Northern Oregon Coast
    Range is a part, or it could refer specifically to a different section of the
    range. The geographical orientation could be subject to interpretation depending
    on how one defines the boundaries of these areas.
  - The question asks whether the Northern Oregon Coast Range is located west of the
    Oregon Coast Range. This question is ambiguous because the "Oregon Coast Range"
    generally refers to the entire mountain range along the coast of Oregon, which
    includes the Northern Oregon Coast Range as a part of it. Therefore, asking if
    the Northern Oregon Coast Range is west of the Oregon Coast Range can be interpreted
    in different ways. One interpretation could be a comparison between the northern
    part and another specific part of the range, while another interpretation might
    be comparing the northern section with the entirety of the range. The question
    lacks specificity about what part of the Oregon Coast Range is being compared
    to the Northern Oregon Coast Range.
  - The question asks about the geographical location of the Northern Oregon Coast
    Range in relation to the Oregon Coast Range. The Northern Oregon Coast Range is
    a specific part of the larger Oregon Coast Range. Geographically, the Northern
    Oregon Coast Range is not located west of the Oregon Coast Range, as it is part
    of the same range. The question is clear in its geographical context and does
    not present multiple interpretations or answers.
  - 'The question asks about the relative geographical location of Northern Oregon
    Coast Range and Oregon Coast Range. The terms used in the question, "Northern
    Oregon Coast Range" and "Oregon Coast Range," refer to specific geographic areas,
    but there might be ambiguity in the interpretation. "Northern Oregon Coast Range"
    is a part of the larger "Oregon Coast Range," and the question seems to be asking
    if this northern part is west of the entire range, which is itself oriented north-south
    along the coast. Without additional context or specific definitions of the terms,
    the question could be interpreted in different ways: whether it refers to a part
    of the range being west of another part or whether it''s asking about the relative
    position of two distinct geographic features. This leads to potential ambiguity
    in understanding and answering the question.'
  - 'The question is asking about the relative location of two geographic areas: the
    "Northern Oregon Coast Range, OR" and the "Oregon Coast Range, OR." The ambiguity
    arises from the fact that the "Oregon Coast Range" is a larger region that encompasses
    various parts, including the northern section. Therefore, the question could be
    interpreted in different ways: it could be asking if the Northern Oregon Coast
    Range is a separate region located to the west of the Oregon Coast Range, or it
    could be asking if the northern part of the Oregon Coast Range is west of the
    rest of the range, which is not typically how geographic locations are described.
    This uncertainty in interpretation leads to different possible answers regarding
    the relative location of these areas.'
  - 'The question asks about the geographical relationship between two locations:
    the Northern Oregon Coast Range and the Oregon Coast Range in Oregon. The potential
    ambiguity arises from the fact that the "Oregon Coast Range" is a broader term
    that includes multiple sub-ranges, one of which is the Northern Oregon Coast Range.
    The question is asking if one specific part (Northern Oregon Coast Range) is located
    west of the whole (Oregon Coast Range), which could be interpreted in different
    ways depending on whether "Oregon Coast Range" refers to its entirety or a specific
    part of it. This makes the question ambiguous, as different interpretations could
    lead to different answers.'
  - 'The question is asking about the relative location of two geographic features:
    the Northern Oregon Coast Range and the Oregon Coast Range. The Northern Oregon
    Coast Range is a specific part of the larger Oregon Coast Range. The question
    could be interpreted in multiple ways: it could be asking if the specific northern
    part is west of the entire range, or if it is west of another part of the range.
    The interpretation is unclear without additional context about what is meant by
    "Oregon Coast Range" (i.e., the entire range or a specific segment). Therefore,
    the question admits more than one interpretation.'
  - The question asks about the geographical relationship between the Northern Oregon
    Coast Range and the Oregon Coast Range in Oregon. The ambiguity arises because
    the "Oregon Coast Range" can refer to the entire range, which includes the Northern,
    Central, and Southern sections. Therefore, asking if the Northern Oregon Coast
    Range is located west of the Oregon Coast Range could be interpreted in different
    ways, depending on whether "Oregon Coast Range" is meant to refer to the entire
    range or a specific part of it. Additionally, the Northern Oregon Coast Range
    is a subset of the Oregon Coast Range, and typically, a subset is not described
    as being west of the set it belongs to. This creates a situation where the question
    admits more than one interpretation, leading to different answers.

  - The question is asking about the relative geographic locations of Boundary Pass,
    WA, and Henry Hagg Lake, OR. The question seems straightforward, but there is
    a potential for ambiguity due to the mention of "Boundary Pass, WA." Boundary
    Pass is a strait that primarily lies between the U.S. and Canada and is not directly
    within Washington state, which might cause confusion. Additionally, the interpretation
    of "located west of" could vary depending on the exact points of reference within
    these areas. However, if we assume the question is asking about the general longitudinal
    positions, it would likely be seeking a clear yes or no answer based on geographic

  - The question asks about the geographical location of Boundary Pass in relation
    to Henry Hagg Lake. It appears to be asking whether Boundary Pass is to the west
    of Henry Hagg Lake. However, there is ambiguity because Boundary Pass is not located
    in Washington (WA) but is actually a strait between the U.S. and Canada. Additionally,
    Henry Hagg Lake is in Oregon (OR). The question could be interpreted as inquiring
    about the relative positions of two geographic locations, but the incorrect association
    of Boundary Pass with Washington adds ambiguity regarding the intended locations.
  - The question asks whether Boundary Pass, WA is located west of Henry Hagg Lake,
    OR. While this question might seem straightforward, there is a potential ambiguity
    in the interpretation of "Boundary Pass, WA." Boundary Pass is a strait located
    between the United States and Canada, near the San Juan Islands, which could be
    what the question is referring to. However, there is no specific location named
    "Boundary Pass" within Washington state itself, which could lead to confusion.
    Additionally, the question assumes a clear understanding of geographical locations
    and their relative positions without providing specific coordinates or further
    context, which could lead to different interpretations of what is being asked.
  - The question asks about the geographical location of Boundary Pass in relation
    to Henry Hagg Lake. However, there is ambiguity in the question because Boundary
    Pass is actually a waterway located between the United States and Canada, primarily
    in the state of Washington. The question seems to imply that Boundary Pass is
    a specific location within Washington state, which could lead to confusion about
    its exact location. Additionally, the phrasing "located west of" could be interpreted
    in different ways depending on the reference points used for each location, especially
    given the large area that Boundary Pass covers. This could lead to different answers
    based on the interpretation of the locations and the reference point. Therefore,
    the question admits more than one interpretation.

    intended location of Boundary Pass. Additionally, the question does not specify
    whether it is asking for a cardinal direction or some other form of "west," such
    as time zone or cultural context, though in this context cardinal direction is
    most likely intended. Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation,
    leading to potential different answers.
  - The question asks whether Boundary Pass, WA is located west of Henry Hagg Lake,
