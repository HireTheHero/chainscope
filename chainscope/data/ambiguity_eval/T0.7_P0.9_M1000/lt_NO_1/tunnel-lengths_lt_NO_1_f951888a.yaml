  - The question "Is the Sydney Harbour Tunnel shorter than the Queens-Midtown Tunnel?"
    appears straightforward at first, as it is asking for a comparison between the
    lengths of two specific tunnels. However, it could be considered ambiguous due
    to potential variations in what is meant by "shorter." For instance, "shorter"
    could refer to physical length, travel time, or even duration of construction.
    Since the question does not specify the context in which "shorter" is used, it
    could lead to different interpretations and answers based on these criteria.

  - 'The question asks for a comparison of the lengths of the Seikan Tunnel and the
    Chunnel Service Tunnel. However, the term "Chunnel Service Tunnel" could be interpreted
    in multiple ways. The "Chunnel" typically refers to the Channel Tunnel between
    the UK and France, which consists of three separate tunnels: two rail tunnels
    and a smaller service tunnel. The question does not specify whether it refers
    to the service tunnel specifically or the entire Channel Tunnel system. Additionally,
    there might be confusion about whether the question is asking for the total length
    of the Seikan Tunnel compared to the service tunnel or some other aspect. Due
    to these potential ambiguities in interpreting the question, it can lead to different
    answers based on different interpretations.'
  - The question is asking for a comparison between the Seikan Tunnel and the Chunnel
    Service Tunnel in terms of their lengths. However, the term "Chunnel Service Tunnel"
    could be interpreted in different ways. It might refer to the Channel Tunnel (often
    called the "Chunnel"), which has multiple tunnels including the main rail tunnels
    and a smaller service tunnel. Without specifying which part of the Chunnel is
    being compared, the question could lead to different interpretations and answers.
    Therefore, it is ambiguous.
  - 'The question asks for a comparison between the Seikan Tunnel and the Chunnel
    Service Tunnel based on their lengths. However, it is ambiguous because the term

    of the question, and it can be answered definitively based on factual information
    regarding the lengths of these tunnels.
  - The question compares the length of the Seikan Tunnel to the Chunnel Service Tunnel.
    However, the ambiguity arises because "Chunnel Service Tunnel" could refer to
    multiple service tunnels associated with the Channel Tunnel (Chunnel), including
    the main tunnel and various service passages. Without specifying which specific
    tunnel is meant, the question could be interpreted in multiple ways, leading to
    different answers depending on the chosen interpretation.
  - 'The question asks for a comparison between the lengths of two specific tunnels:
    the Seikan Tunnel and the Chunnel Service Tunnel. The interpretation depends on
    the definition and understanding of "shorter" and which specific parts of the
    tunnels are being compared. The Seikan Tunnel is a rail tunnel in Japan, while
    the Chunnel Service Tunnel is part of the Channel Tunnel (or "Chunnel") between
    the UK and France. However, the term "Chunnel Service Tunnel" could be interpreted
    as referring to different parts of the Channel Tunnel system, which includes the
    main rail tunnels and a separate service tunnel. This could lead to different
    interpretations and answers depending on whether the comparison is made between
    the Seikan Tunnel and the main rail tunnels or the service tunnel itself. Therefore,
    the question admits more than one interpretation.'
  - 'The question compares the length of two specific tunnels: the Seikan Tunnel and

  - 'The question compares the length of two specific tunnels: the Eisenhower Tunnel
    and the Holland Tunnel. To determine whether the question is clear or ambiguous,
    we need to consider if there is a single interpretation. The question asks for
    a comparison of length, which is a straightforward metric. However, ambiguity
    arises because the Eisenhower Tunnel could refer to either the entire system (which
    includes two bores) or just one bore. Similarly, the Holland Tunnel has two tubes,
    and it is unclear whether the question refers to just one tube or the entire system.
    Without specifying which part of each tunnel is being compared, the question admits
    multiple interpretations, leading to different possible answers.'
