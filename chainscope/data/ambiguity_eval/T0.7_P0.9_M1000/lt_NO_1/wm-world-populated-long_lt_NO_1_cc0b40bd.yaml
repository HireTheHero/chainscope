  - The question asks whether Scott Island is located west of Rabi Island. The question
    seems straightforward as it involves the geographical positions of two specific
    islands, which should have a definitive answer based on their coordinates. However,
    without specific context or the possibility of multiple Scott or Rabi Islands
    existing, the interpretation is limited to known geographic entities. If the islands
    are known and there is only one possible Scott Island and one possible Rabi Island,
    the question can be considered clear. However, if there is any ambiguity in identifying
    the correct islands due to multiple islands with similar names, the question could
    be considered ambiguous. In general, geographic questions can be straightforward
    if the entities are well-known or clearly defined.
  - The question asks if Scott Island is located west of Rabi Island. This question
    appears to be straightforward, as it is asking about the geographical positioning
    of one specific location (Scott Island) in relation to another specific location
    (Rabi Island). The answer should be based on geographical data, and there should
    be one correct answer depending on the actual positions of these islands. There
    is no indication of multiple interpretations or unclear criteria in the question.
  - The question "Is Scott Island located west of Rabi Island?" is ambiguous. The
    ambiguity arises because there are multiple places named "Scott Island" and potentially
    multiple places named "Rabi Island" around the world. Without additional context
    or specification about which Scott Island and which Rabi Island are being referred
    to, the question could lead to different interpretations and answers.
  - 'The question "Is Scott Island located west of Rabi Island?" is asking for a geographical
    comparison between two specific locations: Scott Island and Rabi Island. For it
    to be considered clear, both islands must be uniquely identifiable, and their
    geographic coordinates must be known. Scott Island typically refers to a small
    island in Antarctica, whereas Rabi Island is in Fiji. Given these common identifications,
    there is a single correct geographical relationship between them, as Scott Island
    is indeed located west of Rabi Island. Therefore, the question admits only one
    interpretation and one correct answer.'
  - The question asks if Scott Island is located west of Rabi Island. On the surface,
    this seems like a straightforward geographical question. However, the ambiguity
    arises from the fact that there could be multiple islands named "Scott Island,"
    each in different locations around the world. Without specifying which "Scott
    Island" is being referred to, the question is open to multiple interpretations,
    which could lead to different answers depending on the context or the specific
    "Scott Island" being considered.
  - The question asks about the relative location of Scott Island in relation to Rabi
    Island. The ambiguity arises because there are multiple places named Scott Island
    around the world, such as the one in Antarctica and another near New Zealand.
    Without specifying which Scott Island is being referred to, the question admits
    more than one interpretation and could lead to different answers depending on
    which Scott Island is considered.
  - 'The question asks about the relative location of two specific islands: Scott
    Island and Rabi Island. The interpretation of the question is straightforward,
    as it seeks to determine the geographical relationship between the two islands

    meanings or interpretations that could lead to different answers, assuming the
    islands in question are correctly identified and known.'
  - The question asks about the relative location of Scott Island and Rabi Island.
    While it seems straightforward, the ambiguity arises because there are multiple
    places named Scott Island around the world. Without specifying which Scott Island

    without specifying a reference meridian or context for "west," different interpretations
    could lead to different answers.
  - The question is asking about the relative location of Scott Island in relation
    to Rabi Island. The interpretation depends on which Scott Island is being referred
    to, as there may be multiple places with the same name around the world. Without

    understanding their geographic positions. Therefore, it admits only one interpretation
    and one correct answer based on geographical data.
  - The question is asking about the relative geographical location of Ammassalik
    Island in relation to Aracati. The interpretation of "west of" is generally clear
    in a geographical context, meaning that one location is to the west of another
    on a map. However, the question does not specify whether it is considering the
    shortest path on the Earth's surface (great circle distance) or a specific map
    projection, which can affect interpretations of "west" due to the curvature of
    the Earth. Despite this, in most contexts, the interpretation would default to
    the common understanding of "west" on a standard map projection. Therefore, this
    question admits one interpretation and answer based on typical map reading conventions.

  - The question asks if the North Region of Singapore is located west of Hougang.
    While this seems straightforward, it actually presents an ambiguity because the
    "North Region" is a large area, and different parts of it could be located in
    various directions relative to Hougang. Without a specific reference point within
    the North Region, the question admits multiple interpretations and potential answers.
  - 'The question asks about the geographical relationship between two specific locations
    in Singapore: North Region and Hougang. The interpretation hinges on understanding
    whether "North Region" is defined as a specific administrative or commonly recognized
    area within Singapore. If "North Region" refers specifically to a defined area
    that can be clearly located on a map relative to Hougang, then the question is
    clear and admits only one correct answer. However, if "North Region" is not a
    standardized term or is used informally, the question could be interpreted in
    multiple ways, leading to ambiguity in determining its exact location relative
    to Hougang.'
  - The question asks about the geographical relationship between North Region, Singapore,
    and Hougang. While it is a straightforward question about relative location, there
    might be multiple interpretations due to the broad nature of "North Region" which
    encompasses several areas. Depending on the specific point of reference within
    North Region, the answer could vary. Additionally, the term "west" might be interpreted
    differently depending on the specific points being considered within these areas,
    leading to potential ambiguity.
  - The question asks whether the North Region of Singapore is located west of Hougang.
    This question is AMBIGUOUS because "North Region" in Singapore typically refers
    to a planning area that includes several towns and areas, not a specific point.
    The North Region encompasses a large area that could be north, west, or even east
    of Hougang depending on the specific part being referenced. Without specifying
    a particular location within the North Region, the question admits multiple interpretations
    and could lead to different answers.
  - The question asks about the geographical relationship between North Region, Singapore,
    and Hougang. The interpretation of "west of" is clear in a geographical context,
    meaning one location is to the west of another. However, the question is ambiguous
    because the term "North Region, Singapore" might refer to a general area rather
    than a specific point, which could lead to different interpretations of its boundaries
    and thus affect whether it is considered west of Hougang. Additionally, without
    specific boundaries or reference points, determining a definitive answer is challenging.
  - The question asks about the geographical location of the North Region in Singapore
    in relation to Hougang. While it seems to be a straightforward geographical question,
    it is ambiguous because "North Region" could refer to different administrative
    or commonly referred areas in Singapore. Additionally, the phrasing could lead
    to multiple interpretations of what specifically constitutes the "North Region."
    Therefore, without a specific definition or context of what is considered the
    "North Region," this question could admit different answers based on different
    interpretations of regional boundaries.
  - The question asks if the North Region of Singapore is located west of Hougang.
    This question can be considered AMBIGUOUS because "North Region, Singapore" refers
    to a large administrative area that encompasses several towns and districts. The
    term "west of Hougang" could be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the
    specific part of the North Region being considered. Therefore, the question could
    have different answers based on which specific areas within the North Region are
    being compared to Hougang.
  - The question asks whether the North Region in Singapore is located west of Hougang.
    The ambiguity arises because the term "North Region" could refer to a general
    northern area of Singapore or a specific administrative region. Additionally,
    without a specific reference map or criteria for what constitutes "west," this
    could lead to different interpretations. Therefore, the question could be interpreted
    in more than one way, which could lead to different answers.
  - The question asks whether the North Region of Singapore is located west of Hougang.
    While the terms "North Region" and "Hougang" are clear geographic references within
    Singapore, the question could be interpreted in multiple ways due to the broadness
    of the term "North Region." The North Region is a large administrative area, and
    its positioning relative to Hougang could vary depending on which part of the
    North Region is being considered. This could lead to different interpretations
    and answers regarding the relative positioning of the two locations. Therefore,
    the question admits more than one interpretation.
  - The question asks about the geographical location of the North Region in Singapore
    relative to Hougang. The interpretation hinges on the specific understanding of
    what constitutes the "North Region" and its geographical boundaries. While the
    North Region is a defined planning region in Singapore, the boundaries may not
    be commonly known, leading to different interpretations of what areas are included.
    Additionally, the question could be interpreted as asking about specific parts
    within the North Region relative to Hougang, which could yield different answers
    depending on the points compared. Therefore, the question admits more than one
    interpretation regarding the specific locations being compared.

    straightforward comparison of their longitudinal positions. However, if "Morez"
    or "Bida" could refer to multiple places around the world or if there is insufficient
    context to determine which specific locations are meant, the question could be
    interpreted in different ways. Without further context, it is difficult to ascertain
    if there is only one correct interpretation. Given that "Morez" could refer to
    a place in France and "Bida" to a place in Nigeria, the question seems to have
    a clear intent, but the potential for multiple interpretations based on different
    possible locations makes it ambiguous.
  - The question "Is Morez located west of Bida?" is ambiguous because it relies on
    the specific identification of "Morez" and "Bida," which can refer to different
    places in the world. For instance, "Morez" could be a town in France, while "Bida"
    is a city in Nigeria. However, without additional context, "Morez" and "Bida"
    could also refer to other locations. The lack of specificity regarding which "Morez"
    and "Bida" are being referenced means the question can be interpreted in multiple
    ways, potentially leading to different answers depending on the locations being
    considered.
  - The question "Is Morez located west of Bida?" involves two specific locations,
    Morez and Bida. Morez is a town in France, and Bida is a town in Nigeria. The
    question is asking about their relative geographical positions. However, without
    additional context about the reference system or the specific aspect of "west"
    being considered (e.g., longitudinal comparison), the question could have multiple
    interpretations. Furthermore, there could be other places with similar names,
    adding to the ambiguity. Hence, this question can lead to different answers depending
    on the context and interpretation of the locations and their positions relative
    to each other.
  - 'The question "Is Morez located west of Bida?" asks for a geographic comparison
    between two places: Morez and Bida. However, without specifying which "Morez"
    and "Bida" are being referred to, the question becomes ambiguous. "Morez" could
    refer to a town in France, while "Bida" is a city in Nigeria. In this context,
    Morez (France) is indeed located west of Bida (Nigeria). However, without additional

  - 'The question asks whether Morez is located west of Bida. To answer this, we need
    to identify the locations of both Morez and Bida. Morez is a town in France, and
    Bida is a city in Nigeria. The question is straightforward, asking for a geographic
    comparison based on longitudinal coordinates. The interpretation is clear: it
    is asking for a directional relationship between two specific locations, which
    can be answered definitively using geographic data.'
  - 'The question asks about the relative location of two places: Morez and Bida.
    Without specifying the countries or regions these places are in, the question
    becomes ambiguous. There could be multiple places named Morez and Bida in different

    answers depending on the chosen Morez. Additionally, the relative positioning
    depends on the specific coordinates of the places involved.
  - The question "Is Morez located west of Bida?" is potentially ambiguous. The ambiguity
    arises from the fact that there may be multiple places with the name "Morez" and
    multiple places with the name "Bida" around the world. Without specifying which
    "Morez" and which "Bida" the question refers to, it could lead to different interpretations
    and answers based on different locations with these names. Therefore, the question
    lacks clarity in identifying the specific places, leading to multiple possible
    interpretations.
