  - 'The question "Is Mount Whitney lower than Mount Fuji?" is asking for a comparison
    between the elevations of two specific mountains: Mount Whitney and Mount Fuji.
    This question is clear because it directly compares the heights of two well-defined
    geographical entities, each with a specific and measurable elevation. Therefore,
    it admits one interpretation and one correct answer based on the known elevations
    of these mountains.'
  - The question asks whether Mount Whitney is lower in elevation than Mount Fuji.
    This is a straightforward comparison of the elevations of two specific mountains,
    which are measurable and widely documented. Mount Whitney is the highest peak
    in the contiguous United States, with an elevation of approximately 14,505 feet
    (4,421 meters). Mount Fuji, the highest mountain in Japan, has an elevation of
    approximately 12,388 feet (3,776 meters). Therefore, Mount Whitney is higher than
    Mount Fuji. The question is clear and admits only one interpretation and answer
    based on factual data.
  - The question asks for a comparison between the heights of Mount Whitney and Mount
    Fuji. On the surface, it seems straightforward as it seeks to determine which
    mountain is lower in elevation. However, the ambiguity arises from not specifying
    the context of "lower." It could be interpreted as asking about elevation above
    sea level, or it could be interpreted in terms of prominence, geographical location
    (latitude), or even spiritual or cultural significance, though the latter interpretations
    are less common. The most common interpretation would be elevation above sea level,
    but the question does not explicitly state this, leaving room for ambiguity.
  - 'The question "Is Mount Whitney lower than Mount Fuji?" asks for a comparison
    of the elevations of two specific mountains: Mount Whitney and Mount Fuji. This
    question admits only one interpretation, which is to compare their heights. The
    elevations of both mountains are factual and measurable. Mount Whitney has an
    elevation of 14,505 feet (4,421 meters), while Mount Fuji has an elevation of
    12,388 feet (3,776 meters). Therefore, Mount Whitney is higher than Mount Fuji.
    Given this information, the question is straightforward and can only be interpreted
    in one way.'
  - 'The question "Is Mount Whitney lower than Mount Fuji?" asks for a comparison
    of the elevations of two specific mountains. The interpretation is straightforward:
    it is asking whether the elevation of Mount Whitney is less than that of Mount
    Fuji. This question does not contain ambiguity in terms of its interpretation,
    as it directly compares two known geographical entities based on a single measurable
    attribute: elevation above sea level. Therefore, there is only one correct answer
    based on factual data regarding the elevations of these mountains.'
  - The question "Is Mount Whitney lower than Mount Fuji?" can be considered AMBIGUOUS
    because it admits more than one interpretation. The ambiguity arises from the
    fact that "lower" could refer to different aspects such as elevation above sea
    level, prominence, or even latitude. If the intended meaning is elevation above
    sea level, then Mount Whitney, which is 4,421 meters tall, is indeed lower than
    Mount Fuji, which is 3,776 meters tall. However, if "lower" is interpreted in
    terms of latitude or another context, the answer could differ.
  - The question "Is Mount Whitney lower than Mount Fuji?" asks for a comparison of
    the elevations of two specific mountains, Mount Whitney and Mount Fuji. The question
