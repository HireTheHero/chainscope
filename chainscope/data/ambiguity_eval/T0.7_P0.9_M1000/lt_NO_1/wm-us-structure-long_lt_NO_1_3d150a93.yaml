    is no longer a fixed point that can be easily referenced on a current map, leading
    to potential confusion or multiple interpretations about its exact historical
    location relative to 425 Park Avenue. Additionally, without specifying the direction
    (e.g., cardinal directions), and given the historical context, the question could
    be interpreted differently depending on one''s understanding or knowledge of the
    Drake Hotel''s past location.'

    in New York City, as it was demolished in 2007. Without a current address for
    the Drake Hotel, there could be confusion about which specific location to use
    for comparison. Therefore, the question could be interpreted differently based
    on assumptions about the historical or current context of the Drake Hotel's location.

  - 'The question is asking about the relative location of two specific places: the
    Park Performing Arts Center in New Jersey and Big Pink in New York. The term "west"
    generally refers to a cardinal direction, which can be interpreted in a straightforward
    manner. However, the ambiguity arises because "Big Pink" could refer to multiple
    places or structures, and without additional context, it is unclear which "Big
    Pink" is being referred to. Additionally, the specific addresses or coordinates
    of the locations in question are not provided, which would be necessary to determine
    their relative positions accurately. Therefore, the question can be interpreted

  - The question asks if the Park Performing Arts Center in New Jersey is located
    west of Big Pink in New York. The question seems to seek a straightforward geographical
    comparison between two specific locations. However, the ambiguity arises from
    the lack of precise addresses or coordinates for both locations, which makes it
    unclear which specific "Park Performing Arts Center" or "Big Pink" is being referenced,
    as there could be multiple places with similar names. Without additional context
    or specifications, the question admits more than one interpretation regarding
    the locations being compared.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative location of two places: Park Performing
    Arts Center in New Jersey and Big Pink in New York. The question could be interpreted
    in a straightforward geographical sense, asking whether one location is to the
    west of the other. However, there is an ambiguity because "west" can be interpreted
    in different ways depending on the context (e.g., directly west, slightly west,
    or generally in the western direction). Furthermore, without specific addresses
    or coordinates, the answer could vary based on different interpretations of the
    locations of the two places in question.'
  - The question asks whether the Park Performing Arts Center in New Jersey is located
    west of Big Pink in New York. While it seems straightforward, there are potential
    ambiguities. First, there could be multiple places named "Park Performing Arts
    Center" or "Big Pink," leading to confusion about which specific locations are
    being referenced. Additionally, "west of" is a relative term that depends on specific
    geographical points or boundaries, which might not be well-defined for these locations.
    Without precise coordinates or a map reference, the question could admit different
    interpretations based on different assumptions about the locations or boundaries
    considered.
  - "The question asks if the Park Performing Arts Center in New Jersey is located\
    \ west of Big Pink in New York. To determine whether the question is clear or\
    \ ambiguous, we need to consider whether there is any ambiguity in the location\
    \ of these places or the terms used. \n\n1. \"Park Performing Arts Center, NJ\"\
    \ refers to a specific location in New Jersey, which is generally well-defined.\n\
    2. \"Big Pink, NY\" is more ambiguous, as \"Big Pink\" could refer to various\
    \ things. However, it most likely refers to the house in West Saugerties, New\
    \ York, known for its association with Bob Dylan and The Band. Without further\
    \ context, it's not entirely clear which \"Big Pink\" is being referred to, but\
    \ assuming it's the well-known location in NY, it is still specific enough.\n\
    3. The terms \"west of\" generally have a clear geographical interpretation, meaning\
    \ in a westerly direction from a specific point.\n\nConsidering these points,\
    \ the question could be considered clear if the interpretation of \"Big Pink\"\
    \ is universally understood as the house in New York associated with Bob Dylan.\
    \ However, due to the potential for \"Big Pink\" to refer to different things\
    \ without additional context, there is room for ambiguity. Therefore, the question\
    \ admits more than one interpretation based on the understanding of \"Big Pink.\""

  - 'The question asks if the Park Performing Arts Center in New Jersey is located
    west of Big Pink in New York. This question can be interpreted in only one way:
    it is asking for the relative geographical location of the two structures. However,
    the specific location of "Big Pink" in New York is not clarified, which could
    lead to ambiguity if "Big Pink" refers to different structures or landmarks with
    the same name in different locations. Nevertheless, assuming "Big Pink" refers

    seeks a direct comparison of their positions on a map.'
  - The question asks whether the Park Performing Arts Center in New Jersey is located
    west of Big Pink in New York. The question seems to be straightforward, asking
    for a geographic comparison between two locations. However, there is a potential
    ambiguity in the reference to "Big Pink, NY," which could be interpreted as a
    specific building, an informal name for a location, or a nickname for a place
    that is not widely recognized. Without a clear understanding of what "Big Pink,
    NY" refers to, it is difficult to determine the relative positions of the two
    places. This ambiguity in the reference could lead to different interpretations
    and answers depending on what "Big Pink, NY" is understood to be.
