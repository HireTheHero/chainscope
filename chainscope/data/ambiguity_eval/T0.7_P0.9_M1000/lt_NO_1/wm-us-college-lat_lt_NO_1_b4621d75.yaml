  - The question is asking about the relative geographical location of two specific
    facilities associated with the University of Florida. However, the phrase "University
    of Florida Southwest Recreation Center, FL" is ambiguous because the "Southwest
    Recreation Center" is a known facility at the University of Florida in Gainesville,
    but it is not commonly referred to with the full name "University of Florida Southwest
    Recreation Center, FL." Additionally, the question assumes that both facilities
    are part of the same campus or area, which might not be clear to someone unfamiliar
    with the university's layout. This ambiguity in the naming and location details
    could lead to different interpretations or confusion about what exactly is being
    asked, as the precision needed to determine "south of" might require specific

    in College Station, Texas. The question is ambiguous because it seems to suggest
    that these are two separate geographic locations when, in fact, the College of
    Liberal Arts is part of the Texas A&M University campus. Therefore, the question
    could be interpreted as asking about different campuses or locations that do not
    exist, leading to confusion and multiple interpretations.
  - The question is asking about the geographical location of Texas A&M University
    in relation to Texas A&M College of Liberal Arts. However, the Texas A&M College
    of Liberal Arts is a part of Texas A&M University, which is located in College
    Station, TX. Since they are part of the same institution and located on the same

    there are separate campuses or locations for these entities, but typically, they
    refer to the same place. Thus, the question could be seen as ambiguous due to
    the assumption of separate locations for the university and its college.
  - The question asks if Texas A&M University, TX is located south of Texas A&M College
    of Liberal Arts, TX. However, the ambiguity arises because Texas A&M College of
    Liberal Arts is not a separate geographic location but rather a college within
    Texas A&M University itself. Therefore, it is unclear what is meant by being "south
    of" in this context, as it implies two distinct locations when there is only one
    physical campus. The question could be interpreted in multiple ways depending
    on how one understands the relationship between the university and its college.
  - The question asks if Texas A&M University, TX is located south of Texas A&M College
    of Liberal Arts, TX. This is ambiguous because the Texas A&M College of Liberal
    Arts is a part of Texas A&M University. Therefore, the question could be interpreted
    as asking about the relative location of the broader university to one of its
    colleges, or it might be incorrectly assuming they are separate entities. Without
    additional context clarifying the intended meaning, the question admits more than
    one interpretation.
  - The question asks whether Texas A&M University, TX is located south of Texas A&M
    College of Liberal Arts, TX. The potential ambiguity arises from the fact that
    both entities are part of the same institution, Texas A&M University. The "College
    of Liberal Arts" is a part of Texas A&M University located on the same campus
    in College Station, TX. Therefore, the question might be interpreted as asking
    about different campuses or specific buildings within the same campus, but it
    doesn't specify clearly. The geographical relationship between them is not commonly
    referenced, and since they are part of the same entity, it is unclear how to definitively
    answer the question without additional context or specific geographical markers

    the question is asking whether one part of the university is located south of
    another part. Given the context, the question is likely asking about specific
    buildings or campuses within the university. However, without more specific information,
    such as the exact locations or buildings in question, the question could be interpreted
    in multiple ways. Thus, it admits more than one interpretation regarding what
    is meant by "located south of" within the same university's campus.

    not a separate entity with a distinct location. Therefore, the question is based
    on a misunderstanding of the relationship between the two, leading to an ambiguity
    regarding what is being asked. The phrasing suggests that they are separate locations
    that can be compared geographically, which is not the case. This makes the question
    ambiguous, as it could be interpreted in different ways based on the misunderstanding.
  - The question asks whether Texas A&M University in Texas is located south of Texas
    A&M College of Liberal Arts in Texas. However, Texas A&M University and Texas
    A&M College of Liberal Arts are part of the same university system and are located
    on the same campus in College Station, TX. The question implies they are separate
    entities with distinct geographic locations, which is misleading. Therefore, the
    question admits more than one interpretation, as it could be misunderstood as
    asking about two separate institutions when they are actually part of the same
    campus.

  - The question is asking about the geographical location of Boyer College of Music
    and Dance in relation to Temple University, both located in Pennsylvania. Boyer
    College of Music and Dance is actually part of Temple University, which means
    it is not separate in terms of location. Therefore, the question might stem from
    a misunderstanding, but it only admits one interpretation regarding the geographical
    location of a part of Temple University. The question is specific about the entities
    involved and the directionality being queried.
  - The question asks if Boyer College of Music and Dance is located south of Temple
    University, both of which are in Pennsylvania. This question is clear as it refers
    to specific locations that can be geographically verified, and there is only one
    correct answer based on their geographic positions.
  - 'The question asks whether Boyer College of Music and Dance is located south of
    Temple University, both of which are located in Pennsylvania (PA). The question
    is straightforward and geographic in nature. Given that Boyer College of Music
    and Dance is a part of Temple University, the question can be interpreted in only
    one way: whether the specific location of Boyer College is geographically south
    within the campus or relative to another campus location. This question does not
    introduce any ambiguity regarding the interpretation, as the geographic orientation
    can be definitively determined by looking at a map or the campus layout.'
  - The question asks whether Boyer College of Music and Dance is located south of
    Temple University in Pennsylvania. This can be interpreted in more than one way
    because both Boyer College of Music and Dance and Temple University are part of
    Temple University, meaning they share the same main campus location in Philadelphia,
    PA. Therefore, it's unclear if the question is asking about a specific building
    location within the campus or a different aspect of their location. Additionally,
    without more context or a specific map, it's difficult to provide a definitive
    answer about their relative positions. Thus, the question admits more than one
    interpretation and could lead to different answers.
  - The question asks about the geographical location of Boyer College of Music and
    Dance in relation to Temple University, both of which are located in Pennsylvania
    (PA). Boyer College of Music and Dance is actually a part of Temple University,
    which makes the question's premise incorrect. However, the question itself is
    clear as it asks about relative geographical positions, which could typically
    be answered definitively if the premise were correct.
  - The question asks whether Boyer College of Music and Dance is located south of
    Temple University, both of which are in Pennsylvania. This is a clear geographical
    inquiry. However, Boyer College of Music and Dance is part of Temple University,
    located on its campus in Philadelphia. The question may be interpreted as asking
    if it is located in the southern part of the campus, but since it is not a separate
    entity from Temple University, the question can be misleading. Therefore, the
    question could be interpreted in different ways, such as whether it is south of
    the main administrative building or if it is part of Temple University itself.
  - The question asks about the geographical location of Boyer College of Music and
    Dance in relation to Temple University, both located in Pennsylvania. Boyer College
    of Music and Dance is part of Temple University, so it does not have a separate
    location that can be distinctly described as being "south of Temple University."
    The question could be interpreted as asking about the specific location of the
    music and dance college relative to the main campus, but this does not change
    the fact that it is part of the same institution and does not have a separate
    geographical location. Thus, the question is based on a misunderstanding, but
    it does not admit more than one interpretation. The issue is factual, not interpretative.
  - The question is asking about the geographical location of Boyer College of Music
    and Dance in relation to Temple University, both of which are located in Pennsylvania
    (PA). The question is specific and only admits one interpretation regarding the
    geographical direction (south) between the two locations. Therefore, there is
    only one correct answer based on their actual locations.
  - 'The question is asking about the geographical location of Boyer College of Music
    and Dance in relation to Temple University, both of which are in Pennsylvania.
    However, Boyer College of Music and Dance is part of Temple University, so the
    question could be interpreted in different ways: it could be asking if Boyer is
    south of the main campus or a specific building within the university. This ambiguity
    could lead to different interpretations and answers.'
  - The question is asking whether Boyer College of Music and Dance, which is a part
    of Temple University, is located south of Temple University itself. Since Boyer
    College of Music and Dance is within Temple University in Philadelphia, PA, there
    is an inherent contradiction in asking if it is south of the university it is
    part of. The interpretation of the question is straightforward and geographic
    in nature, but the phrasing suggests a misunderstanding of the relationship between
    the college and the university. Despite this, the question itself does not admit
    multiple interpretations; it is simply based on a misunderstanding. Therefore,
    the question can be classified as CLEAR.

  - 'The question involves determining the geographical relationship between two locations:
    "Q6156423, CA" and "USC Rossier School of Education, CA." The ambiguity arises
    from the identifier "Q6156423, CA," which is not a standard or commonly recognized
    way to refer to a location without further context. The identifier seems to be
    from a specific database (possibly Wikidata), and without access to this database
    or additional information, it is unclear what location "Q6156423, CA" refers to.
    This ambiguity in identifying the location makes the question open to multiple
    interpretations and potentially different answers depending on how "Q6156423,
    CA" is defined or understood. Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation
    based on the identification of "Q6156423, CA."'
  - The question asks if a specific entity, identified by the identifier "Q6156423,"
    is located south of the USC Rossier School of Education in California. The question
    could be considered ambiguous because it relies on the interpretation of "Q6156423"
    without providing explicit information about what this identifier refers to. If
    "Q6156423" is intended to refer to a specific location or entity, that information
    is not directly available or clear within the question itself. Additionally, the
    use of a code (Q6156423) without context can lead to multiple interpretations
    unless the reader has specific knowledge of what it represents. Thus, without
    additional context or a clear understanding of what "Q6156423" is, the question
    can lead to different answers based on different interpretations of what "Q6156423"
    stands for.
  - The question is asking if a location identified as "Q6156423, CA" is situated
    south of the "USC Rossier School of Education, CA". The identifier "Q6156423"
    seems to be a code, possibly a Wikidata identifier, which would need to be translated
    into a specific location name to determine its geographical relationship with
    the USC Rossier School of Education. Without additional information or context
    about what "Q6156423" refers to, the question cannot be answered definitively
    as the interpretation of "Q6156423" is unclear. This ambiguity in identifying
    what "Q6156423" represents leads to multiple possible interpretations of the question.
  - The question asks whether a specific location, identified by the identifier Q6156423,
    CA, is situated south of the USC Rossier School of Education, CA. The ambiguity
    arises from the identifier Q6156423, which does not provide clear information
    about the location it refers to. Without knowing what Q6156423 corresponds to,
    the question cannot be interpreted correctly or answered definitively. Additionally,
    it's unclear whether the question refers to geographic coordinates, administrative
    boundaries, or some other form of southward measurement.
  - The question asks if a specific location, identified as Q6156423, CA, is located
    south of another specific location, the USC Rossier School of Education, CA. The
    question assumes that the identifier Q6156423 is a known entity with a fixed geographical
    location. However, without additional context or information about what Q6156423
    refers to, it is impossible to determine its location relative to the USC Rossier
    School of Education. The identifier Q6156423 seems to suggest a database or catalog
    entry, but without access to the specific database or catalog, the question cannot
    be answered definitively. Therefore, the question is ambiguous because it lacks
    the necessary context to interpret Q6156423 and compare its location to that of
    the USC Rossier School of Education.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographic location of two entities:
    "Q6156423, CA" and "USC Rossier School of Education, CA." The question assumes
    that "Q6156423, CA" is a known location, possibly a specific college or place,
    which might not be immediately recognizable without additional context. The ambiguity
    arises from the identifier "Q6156423," which appears to be a code or identifier
    (possibly from a database like Wikidata), and without knowing what specific place
    this code refers to, the question cannot be definitively answered. Furthermore,
    the question does not provide any clear context or information about "Q6156423,
    CA," making it difficult to determine if the question has a single interpretation.
    Thus, the question admits more than one interpretation based on the lack of clarity
    regarding "Q6156423, CA," leading to potential different answers depending on
    the actual location it refers to.'
  - The question is asking whether a location, identified by the code "Q6156423,"
    in California is located south of the USC Rossier School of Education, which is
    also in California. The question assumes that the reader knows what "Q6156423"
    refers to, which is not clear from the information given. Without knowing the
    specific location that "Q6156423" represents, it is impossible to determine its
    position relative to USC Rossier School of Education. This makes the question
    ambiguous because it relies on external information not provided in the question
    itself.
  - The question is asking whether a specific location, identified by the code Q6156423
    in California, is situated south of the USC Rossier School of Education, also
    in California. The main issue with this question is the use of "Q6156423," which
    appears to be a code that might refer to an entry in a database like Wikidata.
    Without knowing what specific location Q6156423 refers to, the question becomes
    ambiguous because it requires external information to interpret what location
    is being discussed. Therefore, the question could lead to different answers depending
    on the interpretation or identification of Q6156423.
  - The question is asking if a specific location, identified as Q6156423, is south
    of the USC Rossier School of Education in California. The question involves geographic
    locations and directions. The identifier Q6156423 appears to refer to a specific
    place, likely a Wikidata entry, but without additional context or access to a
    database to resolve what Q6156423 specifically refers to, the question cannot
    be clearly answered. Therefore, the interpretation of the question depends on
    knowing what Q6156423 corresponds to, which introduces ambiguity. Without this
    information, there is more than one possible interpretation of what the question
    is asking, leading to potentially different answers based on different assumptions
    about the identity of Q6156423.
  - The question asks whether a specific entity, identified by "Q6156423, CA," is
    located south of the USC Rossier School of Education in California. The question
    hinges on identifying what "Q6156423, CA" refers to. If "Q6156423" is assumed
    to be a unique identifier, such as a Wikidata entity, then the question would
    be clear, provided that the entity can be definitively identified and its geographic
    location established. However, without additional context or information on what
    "Q6156423" specifically refers to, the question is ambiguous, as multiple interpretations
    could arise depending on the entity's identification. Additionally, the question
    assumes knowledge of both the location of "Q6156423, CA" and the USC Rossier School
    of Education, CA, which could lead to different answers if the identifier is not
    resolved.

  - The question asks whether the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering, which is associated
    with Arizona State University in Tempe, AZ, is located south of Wilkes University,
    Mesa, AZ. However, there is ambiguity in the question because Wilkes University
    is primarily located in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, and does not have a widely
    recognized campus in Mesa, AZ. This creates confusion about what is meant by "Wilkes
    University, Mesa, AZ," as it is unclear if this is referring to a specific location
    or partnership that is not well-known. Additionally, the Ira A. Fulton Schools
    of Engineering is part of a larger university system with multiple campuses, which
    could also lead to different interpretations of its location. Due to these factors,
    the question can be interpreted in more than one way, leading to potential differences
    in the answer.
  - 'The question is ambiguous due to the following reasons: The Ira A. Fulton Schools
    of Engineering is actually a part of Arizona State University (ASU) and is not
    located in Mesa, AZ, but rather in Tempe, AZ. Additionally, Wilkes University
    is primarily located in Wilkes-Barre, PA, and does not have a main campus in Mesa,
    AZ. The question incorrectly references Wilkes University as being in Mesa, AZ,
    which adds to the confusion. Furthermore, the question does not specify which
    specific location of the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering or any potential
    satellite campus of Wilkes University is being referred to. Therefore, the question
    allows for multiple interpretations and cannot be answered definitively without
    further clarification.'
  - The question is asking whether the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering in Mesa,
    AZ is located south of Wilkes University. However, there are several ambiguities
    in the question. Firstly, Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering is actually located
    at Arizona State University in Tempe, AZ, not Mesa, AZ. This could lead to confusion
    as to which location is being referred to. Additionally, there is no Wilkes University
    in Mesa, AZ; Wilkes University is primarily located in Wilkes-Barre, PA. If there
    is a reference to a satellite campus or another location, it is not specified,
    leading to further ambiguity. The lack of clarity about the specific locations
    makes the question open to multiple interpretations regarding which places are
    being compared geographically.
  - "The question is asking about the geographical location of the Ira A. Fulton Schools\
    \ of Engineering in relation to Wilkes University in Mesa, AZ. However, there\
    \ are several issues that make the question ambiguous:\n\n1. The Ira A. Fulton\
    \ Schools of Engineering is part of Arizona State University (ASU) and is located\

    \ or a program partnership in Mesa, AZ, it is difficult to provide a single correct\
    \ answer.\n\nGiven these points, the question allows for multiple interpretations\
    \ and lacks clarity on the specifics needed to accurately determine the geographic\

  - The question is ambiguous because it contains references that can lead to multiple
    interpretations. Firstly, the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering is associated
    with Arizona State University, which is located in Tempe, AZ, not Mesa, AZ. Additionally,
    Wilkes University is primarily located in Pennsylvania, but it appears there is
    a reference to Wilkes University in Mesa, AZ, which is not widely recognized.
    The use of "south of" also depends on the geographical understanding and specific
    locations being compared. Due to these unclear references and potential geographical
    misunderstandings, the question admits more than one interpretation.
  - "The question asks whether the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering in Arizona\
    \ is located south of Wilkes University in Mesa, Arizona. However, there are several\
    \ ambiguities here: \n1. Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering is part of Arizona\
    \ State University and has campuses in multiple locations in Arizona, making its\
    \ exact location unclear.\n2. Wilkes University is primarily located in Pennsylvania,\
    \ and there is no widely known branch in Mesa, Arizona.\n3. The phrasing \"Wilkes\

    \ less known location.\n4. The use of \"south\" is vague without a specific reference\
    \ point or detailed location information for each entity.\n\nDue to these ambiguities\
    \ in the locations and phrasing, the question admits more than one interpretation\
    \ regarding geographical placement and institutional presence."
  - 'The question asks if the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering in Mesa, Arizona,
    is located south of Wilkes University. However, there is a geographical inconsistency
    here: Wilkes University is located in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, not in Mesa,
    Arizona. The phrase "Wilkes University, Mesa, AZ" is likely incorrect or misleading.
    This introduces ambiguity as the question seems to imply that Wilkes University
    has a location in Mesa, Arizona, which is not the case. Thus, the question admits
    more than one interpretation due to the geographical confusion.'
  - 'The question is asking about the geographic relationship between two institutions:
    Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering and Wilkes University, both mentioned with
    locations in Arizona. However, there is ambiguity because Wilkes University is
    actually located in Pennsylvania, not Arizona. This creates confusion about the
    intended locations being compared, and the question could be interpreted in different
    ways depending on the assumed location of Wilkes University. Additionally, the
    phrase "Wilkes University, Mesa, AZ" does not correspond to a known location,
    further adding to the ambiguity.'
  - The question is ambiguous because it contains multiple points of confusion. Firstly,
    there is a reference to "Wilkes University, Mesa, AZ," which is problematic because
    Wilkes University is actually located in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, not in Mesa,
    Arizona. This introduces uncertainty about the intended location. Secondly, the
    Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering are part of Arizona State University, which
    has multiple campuses, including ones in Tempe and Mesa, Arizona. The question
    does not specify which campus is being referenced. These ambiguities lead to multiple
    potential interpretations and answers.
  - The question is ambiguous because it contains incorrect and unclear information.
    The Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering is part of Arizona State University,
    which has multiple campuses, and Wilkes University is located in Pennsylvania,
    not Arizona. Additionally, there is no Wilkes University in Mesa, AZ. These inaccuracies
    lead to confusion about the geographical locations being compared, resulting in
    multiple interpretations of the question.

  - The question asks about the geographical location of Rochester Institute of Technology
    (RIT) in relation to Kate Gleason College of Engineering. However, Kate Gleason
    College of Engineering is actually a part of Rochester Institute of Technology.
    This makes the question inherently ambiguous because it could be interpreted as
    asking about two separate institutions when in fact they are part of the same
    institution. The question could be seeking information about the relative positions
    of specific buildings or areas within the RIT campus, but it does not provide
    enough context to determine that. Therefore, due to the lack of clarity about
    what is being compared and the fact that the college is within the institute itself,
    the question is ambiguous.
  - 'The question asks whether Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) is located
    south of Kate Gleason College of Engineering. The ambiguity arises because the

    be asking about the relative location of two distinct places, which doesn''t apply
    here, or it could be interpreted incorrectly due to the misunderstanding of the
    relationship between RIT and its college. This inherent misunderstanding makes
    the question ambiguous, as it does not have a clear or singular interpretation.'

    two ways: one might assume it is asking about the relative location of the overall
    RIT campus to its engineering college, or it could be interpreted as asking about
    the location of RIT in relation to another, separate institution. Since the engineering
    college is a part of RIT, the question is inherently self-referential and does

    could be that the question is asking if the main campus of RIT is south of a specific
    building or area designated as the Kate Gleason College of Engineering within
    the same campus, which would not make sense as they are part of the same institution.
    The other interpretation is simply a misunderstanding of the entities involved,

    Virginia as an operational entity could further complicate the interpretation.
    Thus, the question admits more than one interpretation.
  - The question is asking whether the University of Northern Virginia is located
    south of George Mason University. However, the University of Northern Virginia
    does not exist as a recognized institution, which introduces ambiguity into the
    question. Additionally, there might be confusion about whether the question refers
    to another institution with a similar name or location. This ambiguity in identifying
    the correct institution or location means the question admits more than one interpretation,
    leading to different possible answers.

  - 'The question asks about the relative geographic location of two specific universities
    in Virginia: the University of Northern Virginia and George Mason University.
    However, the University of Northern Virginia is not a well-known or accredited
    institution, and it has faced various legal and operational challenges, including
    closure. This could cause confusion about which institution is being referred
    to. Additionally, the question assumes that both universities are currently operational
    and have fixed locations, which might not be the case. This ambiguity in the existence
    and status of the University of Northern Virginia leads to multiple interpretations
    of the question''s context and answer.'
  - The question is asking whether the University of Northern Virginia is located
    south of George Mason University in Virginia. However, the University of Northern
    Virginia is a defunct institution and is not currently recognized as an active
    university. This could lead to confusion or multiple interpretations regarding
    which specific location or time frame the question refers to, as the institution
    no longer exists and may have had multiple locations in the past. Additionally,
    the question does not specify which campus of George Mason University is being
    referred to, as it has multiple campuses. These factors contribute to the ambiguity
    of the question.
  - 'The question asks about the relative geographical location of two universities

    The question assumes the existence and location of the University of Northern
    Virginia, which may lead to ambiguity, as this institution is not widely recognized
    or may not exist as a traditional university. Additionally, the phrasing "located
    south of" could lead to different interpretations depending on the specific campuses
    or administrative offices considered if the University of Northern Virginia were
    to exist. Therefore, the question admits multiple interpretations and potential
    answers based on assumptions about the existence and location of the University
    of Northern Virginia.'

    does not have a separate geographical location; it is part of the same campus.
    Without additional context, it is difficult to determine if these are distinct
    locations or if the question is incorrectly presuming they might be. Thus, the
    interpretation of the geographical relationship is unclear.
  - The question is asking about the geographical relationship between "Angelo State

    the use of "south" could be interpreted in terms of geographic coordinates or
    in a more colloquial sense. However, given that the question is straightforward
    in asking about geographic location, it can be interpreted as a question of latitude
    comparison between the two places, which can lead to a definitive answer based
    on geographic data. Therefore, despite the historical context, the question is
    primarily about latitude comparison, which admits a clear answer.
