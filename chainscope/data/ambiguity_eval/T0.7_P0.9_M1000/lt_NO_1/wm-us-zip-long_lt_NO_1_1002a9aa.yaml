    in terms of general perceptions of location, such as whether one is considered
    "west" in a broader regional sense without precise coordinates. Since the question
    does not specify how "west" should be interpreted (e.g., strictly by longitude
    or by another measure), it admits more than one interpretation.
  - 'The question asks about the relative west-east position of two specific zip codes:

  - 'The question asks about the relative western position of two zip codes in New
    York: 10583 and 11439. While zip codes can give a general idea of location, they
    are not precise geographical coordinates. However, in this context, the question
    is fairly straightforward as it pertains to the geographical positioning of two
    specific zip codes in New York. The interpretation is singular: it asks which
    of the two zip codes is further west geographically. Despite the potential complexity
    of using zip codes for precise locations, the question itself does not present
    multiple interpretations regarding what is being asked.'
  - The question asks whether a specific location, represented by the zip code 10583
    in New York, is located west of another specific location, represented by the
    zip code 11439 in New York. The interpretation here is geographical, and the question
    seeks a directional relationship based on longitude coordinates. The question
    does not have multiple interpretations, as it clearly asks for a directional comparison
    between two fixed points. Therefore, it admits one interpretation and one correct
    answer based on geographical data.
  - This question is asking whether one specific location (zip code 10583, NY) is
    located west of another specific location (zip code 11439, NY). The question is
    asking for a geographical comparison between two fixed points, which can be determined
    using geographical coordinates. There is only one interpretation of the question,
    and it has a definitive answer based on the geographical data of the zip codes.
  - The question asks whether one specific zip code (10583, NY) is located west of
    another (11439, NY). However, zip codes are not strictly geographical markers
    and can represent non-contiguous areas, making it unclear if one can be definitively
    west of another based solely on zip code numbers. Additionally, without a map
    or additional context, the interpretation of "west" is not clear in terms of geographic
    positioning. Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation, depending
    on how one chooses to define "west" in the context of zip codes.
  - The question is asking if the location of the zip code 10583 in New York is west
    of the location of the zip code 11439 in New York. The interpretation hinges on
    geographic coordinates, which is a clear criteria. However, without additional
    context or specific geographic data, it is not immediately obvious whether 10583
    is indeed west of 11439. The question itself is clear in what it is asking, but
    the answer depends on external geographic information. Since the question does
    not admit multiple interpretations in its phrasing and is solely asking about
    a geographic relationship, it fits the criteria for being clear.
  - The question asks about the relative location of two specific zip codes in New
    York, 10583 and 11439, in terms of their west-east positioning. The question seems
    to be asking whether one zip code is located west of the other, which implies
    a geographical comparison based on longitude. However, the question does not specify
    how "west" is determined (e.g., based on the central point of each zip code area,
    the furthest point, or some other criteria). Additionally, without explicit geographical
    boundaries or a clear reference point, determining "west" can be subjective. Therefore,
    the question could be interpreted in multiple ways, leading to different answers
    depending on the method used to determine the relative positions of the zip codes.

  - The question is asking whether the location of the zip code 78520 in Texas is
    west of the location of the zip code 76020 in Texas. Zip codes are numerical and
    do not inherently convey geographical directionality (east, west, north, south).
    However, if one interprets the question based on the typical numbering system
    of zip codes in the US, where lower numbers are generally in the east and higher
    numbers in the west, one might assume that a higher number could be further west.
    Despite this, zip codes are not guaranteed to strictly follow geographical lines,

    actually located in Brownsville, Texas, which is in the southern part of the state,
    and ZIP code 76020 is in Azle, Texas, which is in the northern part of the state.
    The question may intend to ask about the geographical direction in terms of longitude,
    but since both ZIP codes are in Texas and the question does not specify the criterion
    for "west" (longitude, general direction, etc.), it can lead to different interpretations
    about what "west" means in this context.
  - The question asks about the relative geographical location of two zip codes within
    Texas, 78520 and 76020. It appears to be straightforward as it asks if one zip
    code is located west of the other. However, it is ambiguous because zip codes
    are not inherently geographical coordinates, and their numbers do not necessarily
    correlate with precise longitudinal positions. Thus, the question could be interpreted
    in multiple ways, either asking for a comparison based on zip code numbers or
    actual geographic positions. Additionally, the format of zip codes does not provide
    sufficient information to determine their longitudinal positions without further

    based on their geographical locations. Therefore, the question does not admit
    multiple interpretations or answers.
  - The question is asking about the relative location of two zip codes, 85745 and
    85746, both in Arizona. Zip codes are numerical and do not inherently provide
    geographical information such as direction. However, they are often assigned in
    a manner that can suggest geographic relationships within a region. The question
    assumes that the zip codes are in a location where their numerical order might
    imply geographic order, but without specific knowledge of the geographic layout
    of these zip codes, the question could be interpreted differently. Additionally,
    the question does not specify the reference point from which "west" is determined,
    which could vary depending on the context or map projection used.
  - The question asks whether the location associated with the ZIP code 85745 in Arizona
    is west of the location associated with the ZIP code 85746 in Arizona. ZIP codes
    are geographical areas, and the question is asking for a comparison of their relative
    western positions. Since ZIP codes can be precisely mapped to locations, this
    question can be answered by checking the geographical coordinates of these two
    ZIP codes. Thus, it admits one interpretation and one correct answer based on
    geographical data.
  - The question asks whether the location of ZIP code 85745 in Arizona is west of
    ZIP code 85746 in Arizona. ZIP codes are numerical representations and do not
    inherently provide geographical information regarding their relative positions.
    Although ZIP codes can sometimes be ordered geographically, this is not a strict
    rule, especially in complex areas. Therefore, determining whether one ZIP code
    is geographically west of another requires additional information such as specific
    geographic coordinates or a map, which is not provided in the question. This lack
    of information leads to multiple potential interpretations and answers, such as
    one based on assumptions about the ordering of ZIP codes or one based on external
    geographic data.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 85745 is located west of the zip code 85746,
    both in Arizona. This is a geographical question that can be answered by looking
    at a map or using geographical data to determine the relative positions of the
    two zip codes. It has a clear, factual answer based on their geographic locations.
    Therefore, the question only admits one interpretation and one correct answer.
  - The question asks whether the location corresponding to the zip code 85745 is
    west of the location corresponding to the zip code 85746. The question is clear
    in its request for a geographical comparison based on the locations of two specific
    zip codes. The ambiguity arises from the fact that zip codes are not linear or
    strictly geographical in nature, and proximity or cardinal direction between two
    zip codes cannot be determined without specific geographical data or a map. Thus,
    without additional context or information about the specific locations of these
    zip codes, the question could lead to different interpretations or assumptions
    about how zip codes relate to geographical positioning.
  - The question is asking whether the location with the zip code 85745 in Arizona
    is west of the location with the zip code 85746 in Arizona. This is a straightforward
    geographic inquiry that can be answered by comparing the longitudinal coordinates
    of the two zip codes. There is only one interpretation of the question, which
    is a comparison of the geographic positions of the two specified zip codes in
    relation to each other, specifically in terms of their longitudinal positions.
    Therefore, the question admits only one correct answer based on geographic data.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 85745 in Arizona is located west of the
    zip code 85746 in Arizona. This is a geographically specific question that can
    be answered by examining a map or using geographical data to determine the relative
    positions of these two zip codes. There is only one correct interpretation of
    the question, which is to compare the longitudinal positions of the two zip codes
    to determine which is further west.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 85745 is located west of the zip code 85746,
    both in Arizona. This is a geographical question that can be resolved by looking

  - 'The question involves determining the geographical location of two zip codes:
    52402 and 52328, both in Iowa (IA). The question asks if 52402 is located west
    of 52328. Zip codes are numerical codes used for postal purposes and do not inherently
    convey geographical directions or positions in terms of cardinal directions like
    west or east. To answer this question, one would need to reference a map or a
    database that provides geographical coordinates for these zip codes. However,
    the question itself is straightforward in what it asks, and there is a single
    interpretation: determining the relative west-east position of the two zip codes.
    Therefore, it does not admit multiple interpretations.'
  - The question is asking about the geographical location of two specific zip codes
    in Iowa, 52402 and 52328, and whether the first is located west of the second.
    The interpretation of the question is clear as it pertains to the relative geographical
    positions of two fixed points, which can be determined using a map or geographical
    data. There is only one correct answer based on their actual positions.
  - The question is asking whether the location associated with the zip code 52402
    in Iowa is geographically west of the location associated with the zip code 52328
    in Iowa. This is a specific geographical query and can be answered with the correct
    geographical data. The zip codes refer to specific areas, and their relative positions
    can be determined using a map or geographical database. Therefore, the question
    admits only one interpretation and one correct answer based on geographical facts.
  - The question is asking whether the zip code 52402 in Iowa is located west of the
    zip code 52328 in Iowa. This question can be considered CLEAR because it refers
    to specific geographic locations that can be objectively determined using a map
    or a geographic information system. There is a single interpretation, which involves
    comparing the longitudinal coordinates of the two zip codes to determine which
    one is further west.
  - 'The question is asking whether one specific zip code (52402, IA) is located west
    of another zip code (52328, IA) within the state of Iowa. While zip codes can
    be used to determine general geographical locations, they do not necessarily follow
    strict geographical order (e.g., numerical order does not always correlate with
    geographical direction). However, the question is clear in its request: it asks
    if one zip code is geographically west of another within the same state. The interpretation
    of "west" in this context is based on geographical direction rather than any other
    potential criteria. Thus, the question admits only one interpretation regarding
    geographical positioning.'
  - The question asks whether the zip code 52402 is located west of the zip code 52328
    in Iowa. Zip codes generally follow a numerical order, but they do not strictly
    correspond to geographical directions such as east or west. Therefore, determining
    whether one zip code is "west" of another based solely on the zip code numbers
    can be misleading, as zip codes are not assigned in a strictly geographical manner.
    Moreover, without specific geographical coordinates or additional context about
    the locations these zip codes cover, there can be ambiguity in interpreting what
    "west" means in this context. Thus, the question can be interpreted in different
    ways depending on how one defines the term "located west" and the geographical
    boundaries of the zip codes involved.
  - The question is asking whether the location of the zip code 52402 in Iowa is west
    of the location of the zip code 52328 in Iowa. Zip codes are typically assigned
    based on regional areas, but they do not necessarily follow a strict geographical
    order, such as east to west or north to south. Therefore, determining whether
    one zip code is geographically west of another requires additional geographical
    information, such as the specific coordinates or city locations associated with
    each zip code. Without this information, the question is open to interpretation
    based on different criteria (e.g., numerical order vs. geographical location).
    Thus, the question is ambiguous.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 52402 in Iowa is located west of the zip
    code 52328 in Iowa. This is a geographical question that can be answered by examining
    the relative positions of these two zip codes on a map. Since zip codes are specific
    to certain areas, the interpretation of the question is straightforward and does
    not admit multiple interpretations. Therefore, the question can be classified
    as having one correct answer based on geographic data.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 52402 in Iowa is located west of the zip
    code 52328 in Iowa. This question is geographically based and requires knowledge
    of the locations corresponding to these zip codes. Zip codes are specific to geographic
    areas, and their locations can be determined using maps or geographic data. Therefore,
    this question has a clear interpretation and can be answered definitively based
    on the geographic coordinates or map location of the two zip codes.
  - The question is asking whether the location of the zip code 52402 in Iowa is west
    of the location of the zip code 52328 in Iowa. This question is clear because
    it seeks a geographical comparison based on longitude between two specific zip
    codes, which can be determined with precise coordinates. There is no ambiguity
    in the interpretation of the question, as it strictly refers to the geographic
    positioning of two defined locations.

  - 'The question involves determining the relative geographic positions of two locations
    based on their zip codes: 07760, NJ, and 10014, NY. The query is about whether
    07760 is located west of 10014. While the question might seem straightforward,
    it assumes that zip codes are geographically linear or comparable in terms of
    east-west orientation, which is not always the case. Zip codes are designed for
    postal routes and not strictly for geographic orientation, meaning they don''t
    always follow a straightforward geographic pattern. However, if we interpret the
    question based on geographic coordinates, there is a clear way to determine if
    one location is west of another by comparing their longitudinal values. Despite
    potential misunderstandings about zip codes, the question itself asks for a specific
    geographic comparison that can be answered accurately with the correct geographic
    data.'
  - The question is asking whether the location of the zip code 07760 in New Jersey
    is west of the zip code 10014 in New York. While the question seems straightforward,
    it is ambiguous because the term "west" could refer to several different interpretations.
    For example, it could mean longitudinally west, which involves geographical coordinates.
    However, in practical terms, because zip codes do not correspond directly to specific
    geographic points but rather to areas that can vary in size and shape, determining
    which is "west" requires assumptions about how to compare these areas. Additionally,
    factors like the shape and boundaries of the zip code areas, and the fact that
    zip codes can cover non-contiguous areas, further complicate this assessment.
    Therefore, the interpretation of "west" and how to determine it from zip codes
    is not singular and could lead to different answers depending on the method or
    criteria used.
  - The question asks if the zip code 07760 in New Jersey is located west of the zip
    code 10014 in New York. The interpretation hinges on geographical positioning,

  - The question is asking whether one specific ZIP code in New York (12123) is located
    west of another ZIP code in New York (11510). The interpretation of "west" in
    this context relates to geographical positioning, which can be determined using
    latitude and longitude coordinates. ZIP codes have specific boundaries and thus,
    the question has a clear criterion for determining the answer based on geographical
    data. Therefore, the question has only one correct interpretation and answer based
    on the relative geographical location of these ZIP codes.
  - The question is asking whether one zip code in New York is located west of another
    zip code in New York. At first glance, it seems to be a straightforward geographical
    question. However, zip codes are not strictly linear or geographically ordered,
    and determining whether one is "west" of another can be ambiguous without additional
    context or a specific method for determining the relative position (e.g., using
    specific geographical coordinates or a map). Additionally, the boundaries of zip
    codes can be irregular, which might lead to different interpretations of "west"
    based on different mapping tools or criteria.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographical location of two zip codes
    in New York: 12123 and 11510. The terms used in the question are specific and
    refer to zip codes, which are well-defined numerical codes used to identify specific
    geographic areas. The question seeks to determine whether one zip code is located
    west of another, which is a straightforward comparison based on geographical coordinates.
    There is no ambiguity in the interpretation of the question as it pertains to
    geography, and it admits only one correct answer based on the longitudinal data
    of the zip codes.'

    York is west of the location associated with the zip code 11510 in New York. This
    can be interpreted clearly by determining the geographical coordinates (longitude
    and latitude) of the two zip codes and comparing their positions. The question
    does not have multiple interpretations and admits one correct answer based on
    geographical data.
  - 'The question asks whether the location of the zip code 12123 in New York is west
    of the location of the zip code 11510 in New York. This question is clear and
    specific because zip codes are fixed and have precise geographical locations.
    The interpretation of the question is straightforward: it is asking for a comparison
    of the longitudinal positions of two specific zip codes. Since this only involves
    determining which of the two locations is further west based on their geographical
    coordinates, there is only one correct interpretation and one correct answer.'
  - The question asks whether one location in New York (with the zip code 12123) is
    located west of another location in New York (with the zip code 11510). The interpretation
    of the question is clear because it seeks a geographical comparison based on the
    longitudinal position of the two zip codes. There is one correct answer based
    on the geographical coordinates of these zip codes.
  - 'The question asks whether one specific zip code (12123, NY) is located west of
    another (11510, NY). This question involves geographical locations, which can
    be determined using longitude coordinates. The interpretation here is straightforward:
    it asks for a comparison of longitudinal positions of the two zip codes. Since
    the question relies on objective geographic data, it admits only one interpretation
    and one correct answer based on the coordinates of the given zip codes.'
  - The question asks whether one zip code in New York is located west of another
    zip code in New York. This question is specific in terms of the geographical locations
    it refers to. Zip codes are defined areas, and their relative positions can be
    determined based on geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude). Therefore,
    there is one interpretation of the question, which involves comparing the longitudinal
    coordinates of the two zip codes to determine which one is west of the other.
    This analysis leads to a definitive answer based on geographic data.

  - The question asks whether one specific US zip code (08026, NJ) is located west
    of another specific US zip code (08867, NJ). This question involves determining
    the geographical relationship between two fixed points based on their zip codes.
    There is only one interpretation of this question, which is to compare the longitudinal
    coordinates of the two locations to determine which one is west of the other.
    This yields one correct answer based on geographical data.
  - The question is asking if one location (08026, NJ) is located west of another
    location (08867, NJ). While the question is specific in terms of the locations
    mentioned, the term "west" is spatial and depends on the relative positioning
    of the two locations on a map. This could be interpreted through geographical
    coordinates, road routes, or even perceived cultural regions, which might not
    always align perfectly. However, if we assume the interpretation is based on straightforward
    geographical coordinates (longitude), the question could be clear. Still, without
    specifying the method of determining "west," there is room for different interpretations
    (e.g., driving distance west, perceived west, etc.).
  - The question asks whether the location of the zip code 08026 in New Jersey is
    west of the location of zip code 08867 in New Jersey. This question is clear because
    it is a straightforward geographical inquiry that requires checking the relative
    longitudinal positions of the two zip codes. There is only one interpretation
    and one correct answer based on geographical data.
  - The question asks whether one zip code in New Jersey (08026) is located west of
    another zip code in New Jersey (08867). The question is specific and asks about
    a geographical relationship between two defined points. However, the question
    does not provide sufficient context about how "west" is determined (e.g., are
    we considering the center of each zip code area, or a specific point within each
    zip code?). Despite this, the general interpretation would be to compare the longitudinal
    coordinates of the central points of these zip codes, which provides a single
    clear answer. Thus, the question has a primary interpretation that can be answered
    by geographical data.
  - 'The question asks about the relative geographical location of two zip codes within
    New Jersey: 08026 and 08867. Zip codes are specific and unique identifiers for
    regions, which allows for a straightforward comparison of their geographical locations.
    The question is asking whether one zip code is located west of the other, which
    can be determined by examining a map or using geographical coordinates. There
    is only one correct interpretation and answer to this question based on the established
    geographical data of the zip codes.'
  - The question asks whether the location of the zip code 08026 in New Jersey is
    west of the location of the zip code 08867 in New Jersey. This question is clear
    because it seeks a geographical comparison between two specific zip codes, which
    can be determined by looking at their coordinates or a map. There is only one
    interpretation and one correct answer to this question based on geographical data.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographical location of two specific
    zip codes in New Jersey: 08026 and 08867. The question is clear in its intent
    to determine if one is west of the other. There is only one interpretation of
    what "west" means in this context, and the answer can be determined using geographical
    data (longitude information) of the zip codes. Therefore, the question is straightforward
    and admits only one correct answer based on geographical data.'
  - The question is asking whether the location corresponding to the zip code 08026
    in New Jersey is situated to the west of the location corresponding to the zip
    code 08867 in New Jersey. This question is clear because it involves a straightforward
    geographical comparison of two specific locations based on their zip codes, which
    have a single correct answer based on their longitudinal coordinates.
  - The question asks whether the location of one New Jersey zip code (08026) is west
    of another New Jersey zip code (08867). While the question seems straightforward,
    it assumes that zip codes can be directly compared geographically based on their
    numerical order, which is not always accurate. Zip codes do not follow a strict
    east-to-west order, and their numbers are not inherently geographic coordinates.
    Therefore, the question could be interpreted as asking for a geographic comparison
    based on incorrect assumptions, leading to different interpretations depending
    on how one understands zip code arrangements.
  - The question is asking about the geographical relationship between two zip codes
    in New Jersey. However, there could be ambiguity in the interpretation of "located
    west of," as it depends on the specific point of reference within each zip code
    area. Zip code boundaries can be irregular, and without specifying whether the
    question refers to the geographic center or another specific point within each
    zip code, multiple interpretations and answers are possible.
