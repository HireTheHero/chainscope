    a song by The Doobie Brothers, written by Michael McDonald and Kenny Loggins,
    not just Kenny Loggins alone. This could lead to confusion about which version
    or artist''s song is being referred to. If the question is interpreted strictly
    as asking about Kenny Loggins''s version, which might not be as widely recognized
    or might not even exist as a separate release, the answer could differ from the

  - 'The question asks for a comparison of the release dates of two songs: Deana Carter''s
    "Did I Shave My Legs for This?" and Nirvana''s "Old Age." This question is potentially
    ambiguous due to the following reasons:


    1. Nirvana''s "Old Age" was never officially released by the band during its active
    years but was recorded during the "Nevermind" sessions in 1991. It was later released
    by Courtney Love''s band Hole in 1993 and appeared on Nirvana''s 2004 box set
    "With the Lights Out." This means there are multiple dates associated with the
    song that could be considered its release date.


    2. Deana Carter''s "Did I Shave My Legs for This?" was released as part of an
    album in 1996, and there is no ambiguity about its release date.


    Given the different interpretations regarding the release date of Nirvana''s "Old
    Age," the question admits more than one interpretation and could lead to different
    answers depending on which release date is considered.'

  - 'The question is asking for a comparison of the release dates of two songs: "One

    famously known as a duet by Elton John and Kiki Dee, not just by Kiki Dee alone.
    This ambiguity in attributing the song could lead to confusion in identifying

    as asking for the release date of a different song by Kiki Dee with a similar
    title if one exists, further adding to the ambiguity.'
  - 'The question is asking for a comparison of the release dates of two specific

    is more famously known as a duet between Elton John and Kiki Dee, and it is unclear

    "Don''t Go Breaking My Heart" is actually a duet with Elton John, and it is commonly
    credited to both artists. The question does not specify the duet version, which
    could lead to some confusion. However, given the context and common knowledge,
    it is likely that the question refers to the duet version. Despite this potential
