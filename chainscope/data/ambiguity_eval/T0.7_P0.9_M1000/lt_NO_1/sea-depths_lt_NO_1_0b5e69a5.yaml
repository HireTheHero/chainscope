    to this question, which can be determined by examining the average depths of both
    the Caribbean Sea and the Sargasso Sea.
  - The question "Is the Caribbean Sea shallower than the Sargasso Sea?" is AMBIGUOUS.
    This is because the depth of a sea can vary greatly in different areas, and the
    question does not specify which part of each sea is being compared. Additionally,
    the term "shallower" could refer to average depth, maximum depth, or some other
    measure, which is not specified in the question.
  - The question asks whether the Caribbean Sea is shallower than the Sargasso Sea.
    This is a straightforward question comparing the depth of two specific bodies
    of water. The terms "Caribbean Sea" and "Sargasso Sea" are well-defined geographical
    regions, and "shallower" is a clear term relating to depth. Since the question
    involves a comparison of depth, which is a measurable physical property, it admits
    only one correct interpretation and answer based on geographical data.
  - The question asks for a comparison of depth between the Caribbean Sea and the
    Sargasso Sea. It appears straightforward, seeking a factual answer about the relative
    shallowness of two specific seas. While it could be perceived as ambiguous if
    one considers different parts of the seas, the question generally implies an overall
    comparison, which is a common and understandable interpretation. Therefore, the
    question is primarily seeking a single factual answer based on the general depths
    of these seas.
  - The question "Is the Caribbean Sea shallower than the Sargasso Sea?" is AMBIGUOUS.
    The ambiguity arises because the Sargasso Sea is not defined by land boundaries,
    but rather by ocean currents, which makes its depth variable and less straightforward
    to compare with the Caribbean Sea, which is a more clearly defined body of water.
    Additionally, the term "shallower" could be interpreted in different ways, such
    as average depth, maximum depth, or even the depth at specific points, leading
    to different possible answers.
  - 'The question "Is the Caribbean Sea shallower than the Sargasso Sea?" is asking
    for a comparison between the depths of two specific bodies of water: the Caribbean
    Sea and the Sargasso Sea. The question is straightforward and seeks a factual
    comparison based on measurable data regarding the depths of these seas. There
    is no ambiguity in terms of what is being asked; the question is clearly about
    the relative depths of these two seas. Therefore, it admits one interpretation
    and one correct answer based on the available geographical data.'
  - The question asks for a comparison between the depths of the Caribbean Sea and
    the Sargasso Sea. While the question itself is straightforward and seeks a factual
    comparison, the term "shallower" is used, which suggests a comparison based on
    average or general depth. However, both seas have varying depths at different
    locations, and the question doesn't specify whether the comparison should be made
    based on average depth, maximum depth, or another metric. Despite this, generally
    accepted data could provide a single answer based on average depths, making the
    question more clear than ambiguous.
