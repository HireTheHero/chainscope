    asking about the release of "The City and the Stars" specifically, not "Against
    the Fall of Night." Therefore, the comparison is between the 1956 publications
    of both books. Since they were released in the same year, the question can be
    answered factually by specifying the exact release dates within that year, if
    available. The question does not contain any ambiguity in terms of what is being
