  - The question "Does acetone have a lower boiling point than carbon dioxide?" is
    AMBIGUOUS. This is because carbon dioxide is typically a gas at room temperature
    and does not have a boiling point in the traditional sense as it sublimates directly
    from solid to gas under normal atmospheric pressure. However, if one were to consider
    the sublimation point of carbon dioxide under specific conditions, it could be
    compared to the boiling point of acetone. Due to these different interpretations
    of how to compare the two substances, the question can lead to different answers
    based on the assumptions made.
  - The question is asking about the boiling points of acetone and carbon dioxide.
    However, the question is ambiguous because carbon dioxide is typically a gas at
    room temperature and does not have a boiling point under standard atmospheric
    pressure; it sublimates directly from solid to gas. Acetone, on the other hand,
    is a liquid at room temperature and has a well-defined boiling point. Therefore,
    the comparison between the boiling points of acetone and carbon dioxide is not
    straightforward and can be interpreted in different ways, such as considering
    the sublimation point of carbon dioxide instead.
  - 'The question is asking about the boiling points of acetone and carbon dioxide.
    Acetone is a liquid at room temperature with a well-defined boiling point, whereas
    carbon dioxide is a gas at room temperature and sublimates rather than boiling
    under normal atmospheric pressure. This difference in state and behavior at standard
    conditions could lead to confusion. Thus, the question can be interpreted in two
    ways: comparing the boiling point of acetone to the sublimation point of carbon
    dioxide, or considering conditions under which carbon dioxide can exist as a liquid
    (high pressure), which are not specified. Therefore, the question admits more
    than one interpretation.'
  - The question is asking for a comparison of boiling points between acetone and
    carbon dioxide. However, carbon dioxide is a gas at standard atmospheric pressure
    and does not have a boiling point in the traditional sense; instead, it sublimates
    directly from solid to gas. This could lead to confusion or require additional
    clarification on whether the conditions for carbon dioxide should be altered (e.g.,
    under pressure to become a liquid). Thus, the question can be interpreted in more
    than one way depending on the understanding of carbon dioxide's state changes.
  - "The question asks about the boiling points of acetone and carbon dioxide. Acetone\
    \ is a liquid at room temperature with a boiling point of about 56\xB0C, while\
    \ carbon dioxide is a gas under normal atmospheric pressure and sublimates at\
    \ -78.5\xB0C. The comparison between a liquid's boiling point and a gas's sublimation\
    \ point could lead to confusion. While carbon dioxide does not have a boiling\
    \ point at standard atmospheric pressure, the question might be interpreted as\
    \ asking for a comparison at conditions where both substances are in liquid form.\
    \ Thus, the question could be considered ambiguous due to the different states\
    \ of matter under normal conditions and potential variations in the interpretation\
    \ of \"boiling point\" for carbon dioxide."
  - The question is asking for a comparison between the boiling points of acetone
    and carbon dioxide. However, the question is ambiguous because carbon dioxide
    is typically a gas at room temperature and sublimes rather than boils under normal
    atmospheric conditions. This means it transitions directly from solid to gas,
    skipping the liquid phase. Therefore, the concept of a boiling point for carbon
    dioxide is not straightforward. This can lead to different interpretations of
    what the question is asking (e.g., comparing sublimation points versus boiling
    points), which could yield different answers.
  - The question is AMBIGUOUS because it contains a factual inaccuracy that leads
    to confusion. Acetone is a liquid at room temperature with a boiling point, whereas
    carbon dioxide is a gas at room temperature and does not have a boiling point
    in the same way a liquid does. Instead, carbon dioxide sublimates from a solid
    to a gas. This discrepancy in states of matter and the nature of boiling points
    versus sublimation points makes the question open to multiple interpretations
    and answers.
  - The question is asking for a comparison of boiling points between acetone and
    carbon dioxide. However, this question is ambiguous because carbon dioxide does
    not have a boiling point under normal atmospheric pressure; it sublimates directly
    from solid to gas. Therefore, the interpretation of "boiling point" for carbon
    dioxide could lead to confusion, as it does not exist in liquid form under standard
    conditions. This can lead to different answers depending on how one interprets
    the phase change of carbon dioxide.
  - The question asks about the boiling points of acetone and carbon dioxide. Acetone
    is a liquid at room temperature with a well-defined boiling point. However, carbon
    dioxide is a gas at room temperature and does not have a boiling point under normal
    atmospheric conditions; instead, it sublimates. The question could be interpreted
    in different ways depending on how one interprets "boiling point" for carbon dioxide.
    One could consider the sublimation point instead, leading to potential confusion.
    Thus, the question admits more than one interpretation.
  - The question asks about the boiling points of acetone and carbon dioxide. However,
    there is an inherent ambiguity because carbon dioxide is typically a gas at standard
    atmospheric pressure and doesn't have a conventional boiling point; instead, it
    sublimates directly from solid to gas. This could lead to different interpretations
    of what is being asked, such as comparing sublimation points or considering different
    pressures where both might exist as liquids. Therefore, the question admits more
    than one interpretation.
