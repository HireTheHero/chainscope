    is being compared, the question admits multiple interpretations.
  - 'The question "Is the Golden Gate Bridge shorter than the Forth Bridge?" is asking
    for a comparison between the lengths of two specific bridges: the Golden Gate
    Bridge and the Forth Bridge. While this might seem straightforward, there is ambiguity
    because "shorter" could refer to different measurements (e.g., total length, main
    span length, or some other dimension). The Golden Gate Bridge is often measured
    by its main span, while the Forth Bridge could be measured by its total length
    or its own main span, leading to different interpretations and answers depending

    is ambiguous because it does not specify which Chesapeake Bay Bridge is being
    referenced.'
  - 'The question is asking for a comparison of the lengths of two specific bridges:
    the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. The question
    could be interpreted in more than one way because there are two bridges commonly
    referred to as the "Chesapeake Bay Bridge": the Chesapeake Bay Bridge in Maryland
    and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel in Virginia. Each of these bridges has a
    different length, which could lead to different answers depending on which one
    is being compared to the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge.'
  - 'The question asks for a comparison between two bridges: the San Francisco-Oakland
    Bay Bridge and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. The ambiguity arises from the fact that
    both "San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge" and "Chesapeake Bay Bridge" can refer
    to multiple structures. The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge has two main spans
    (the western and eastern spans), and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge could refer to
    the Chesapeake Bay Bridge in Maryland or the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel in Virginia.
    Without specifying which spans or structures are being compared, the question
    admits multiple interpretations, each potentially leading to a different answer.'
  - 'The question asks for a comparison of the lengths of two specific bridges: the
    San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. The interpretation
    is straightforward as it involves measuring the lengths of these two specific
    bridges to determine which one is shorter. There is only one correct answer based
    on factual data regarding the lengths of the bridges.'
  - The question asks for a comparison between the lengths of the San Francisco-Oakland
    Bay Bridge and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. While it seems straightforward, there
    could be ambiguity in interpreting which specific spans or sections of these bridges
    are being compared. Both bridges have multiple spans and sections, and without
    specifying whether the entire bridge or specific parts are being compared, the
    question can lead to different interpretations and answers.
  - The question asks for a comparison between the lengths of the San Francisco-Oakland
    Bay Bridge and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. However, there is ambiguity because
    there are multiple bridges referred to as the "Chesapeake Bay Bridge" (for example,
    the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel in Virginia and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge in
    Maryland). Without specifying which Chesapeake Bay Bridge is being referred to,
    the question admits more than one interpretation, leading to different potential
    answers.
  - 'The question is asking for a comparison of the lengths of two specific bridges:
    the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. The interpretation
    depends on which specific spans or sections of these bridges are being referred
    to, as both bridges have complex structures with multiple sections. Without specifying
    which sections are being compared, the question could be interpreted in different
    ways, leading to different answers.'
  - 'The question asks for a comparison of the lengths of two specific bridges: the
    San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. While at first
    glance this seems straightforward, the ambiguity arises from the fact that "Chesapeake
    Bay Bridge" could refer to two different structures: the Chesapeake Bay Bridge
    in Maryland, also known as the William Preston Lane Jr. Memorial Bridge, or the
    Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel in Virginia. These two structures have different
    lengths, which leads to multiple interpretations of the question. Therefore, without
    clarification on which bridge is being referred to, the question could yield different
    answers.'
