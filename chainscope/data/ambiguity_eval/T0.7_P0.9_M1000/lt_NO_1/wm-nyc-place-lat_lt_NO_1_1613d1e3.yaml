    However, the question is ambiguous because:

    1. There might be multiple places named "CAMBRIDGE HOTEL" in Manhattan.

    2. "RFK BRIDGE PED AND BIKE" might refer to different paths or entrances associated
    with the RFK Bridge, which spans different areas.

    Due to these factors, the question can admit multiple interpretations based on
    the specific locations being referred to, which could lead to different answers.'
  - The question is asking if a specific hotel in Manhattan is located south of a
    specific location in the Bronx. This question involves geographical locations
    and directions, which typically have precise answers based on maps or coordinates.
    The question assumes that there is only one "Cambridge Hotel" in Manhattan and
    one "RFK Bridge Ped and Bike" in the Bronx, which might not be the case if there
    are multiple places with similar names or if the names are not widely recognized
    or standardized. However, the question itself is asking for a straightforward
    directional relationship between two specific points, which can be determined
    using a map or GPS data.
  - 'The question asks about the relative location of CAMBRIDGE HOTEL in Manhattan
    and RFK BRIDGE PED AND BIKE in the Bronx. The question is specific and asks if
    one location (the hotel) is south of another location (the bridge). This is a
    geographic question that can be answered with a map or geographic data. There
    is only one interpretation: determining the cardinal direction from one specific
    location to another. The ambiguity could arise if there were multiple "Cambridge
    Hotels" or "RFK Bridge" paths, but the question specifies "CAMBRIDGE HOTEL, Manhattan"
    and "RFK BRIDGE PED AND BIKE, Bronx," reducing the likelihood of multiple interpretations.
    Therefore, the question can be interpreted in one way and answered based on geographic
    information.'
  - The question is asking about the relative location of "CAMBRIDGE HOTEL, Manhattan"
    and "RFK BRIDGE PED AND BIKE, Bronx" in terms of whether the former is south of
    the latter. The question is ambiguous because there is no widely known "CAMBRIDGE
    HOTEL" in Manhattan, and the RFK Bridge (also known as the Triborough Bridge)
    connects Manhattan, Queens, and the Bronx, making it unclear which part of the
    bridge or which path (pedestrian or bike) is being referred to. Additionally,
    the specific locations of these points are not clearly defined in the question,
    leading to multiple possible interpretations and answers based on different assumptions
    about the exact locations involved.
  - The question asks whether "CAMBRIDGE HOTEL, Manhattan" is located south of "RFK
    BRIDGE PED AND BIKE, Bronx." The question is ambiguous for several reasons. First,
    there is no widely recognized "CAMBRIDGE HOTEL" in Manhattan, which means the
    question might be referring to a lesser-known or fictional place, leading to uncertainty
    in interpretation. Second, the reference to "RFK BRIDGE PED AND BIKE" may not
    be a commonly understood term, as the RFK Bridge (also known as the Triborough
    Bridge) connects multiple boroughs and has various access points for pedestrians
    and cyclists. Additionally, without specific addresses or coordinates, it's unclear
    which exact locations are being compared, leading to multiple possible interpretations
    of the question's intent. Therefore, the question can lead to different answers
    based on these interpretations.
  - The question asks if "CAMBRIDGE HOTEL, Manhattan" is located south of "RFK BRIDGE
    PED AND BIKE, Bronx." The question appears to be clear in its intent to determine
    the relative geographical location of one specific place in Manhattan to another
    specific place in the Bronx. However, the potential ambiguity arises from the
    specificity and existence of "CAMBRIDGE HOTEL" in Manhattan, as there may be multiple
    places with similar names or the place might not be well-known. Additionally,
    "RFK BRIDGE PED AND BIKE" is a specific part of the RFK Bridge, which may not
    be commonly referred to in that manner, leading to possible confusion. Therefore,
    the question could lead to different interpretations or require clarification
    on the specific locations being referred to.
  - 'The question is asking about the geographical location of the Cambridge Hotel
    in relation to the RFK Bridge Pedestrian and Bike path. The question includes
    specific landmarks: "Cambridge Hotel, Manhattan" and "RFK Bridge Ped and Bike,
    Bronx." However, there is ambiguity because there might be multiple places with
    similar names, and the exact location of "Cambridge Hotel" is not specified clearly.
    Additionally, the RFK Bridge connects multiple boroughs, and the "Ped and Bike"
    path could refer to different sections. This uncertainty leads to multiple possible
    interpretations of the locations in question.'
  - The question is asking whether a specific location, CAMBRIDGE HOTEL in Manhattan,
    is situated south of another specific location, RFK BRIDGE PED AND BIKE in the
    Bronx. The question involves specific geographical locations and a directional
    relationship between them. However, the ambiguity arises because the question
    does not specify which CAMBRIDGE HOTEL is being referred to, as there may be multiple
    hotels with that name or similar names, potentially leading to different interpretations
    and answers. Additionally, without precise addresses or coordinates, determining
    a directional relationship could also be unclear.
  - 'The question is asking whether the Cambridge Hotel in Manhattan is located south
    of the RFK Bridge Pedestrian and Bike path in the Bronx. The question refers to
    specific locations: a hotel and a bridge. However, there is potential ambiguity
    because the Cambridge Hotel is not a well-known landmark in Manhattan, and there
    could be multiple places with similar names. Additionally, the RFK Bridge has
    multiple entry and exit points, and the specific location referred to by "RFK
    BRIDGE PED AND BIKE" could be interpreted differently. These factors can lead
    to different interpretations of the locations, making the question ambiguous.'
  - 'The question asks whether the Cambridge Hotel in Manhattan is located south of
    the RFK Bridge Pedestrian and Bike Path in the Bronx. This requires a geographical
    comparison between two specific locations. However, the question is ambiguous
    for a couple of reasons: Firstly, there may be multiple places referred to as
    "Cambridge Hotel" in Manhattan, and without a specific address, it''s unclear
    which one is meant. Secondly, the RFK Bridge Pedestrian and Bike Path spans a
    significant area, and without specifying a particular point on the path, it is
    difficult to determine the relative position accurately. Therefore, the question

    about whether the question is asking about the relative locations of two places
    within Manhattan or between Manhattan and Brooklyn.
  - 'The question is asking about the geographical relationship between two places:
    Hillman Houses and Williamsburg, both mentioned as being in Manhattan. However,
    there is ambiguity in this question because Williamsburg is not a neighborhood
    in Manhattan; it is actually in Brooklyn. This inconsistency makes the question
    ambiguous, as it is unclear whether the intention is to compare the location of
    Hillman Houses to a part of Manhattan or to Williamsburg in Brooklyn. Depending
    on the interpretation, the answer could vary.'
  - The question is asking whether Hillman Houses in Manhattan is located south of
    Williamsburg in Manhattan. However, there is an inherent ambiguity because Williamsburg
    is actually a neighborhood in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. This discrepancy in the
    question's phrasing leads to confusion and multiple interpretations, as one might
    consider the intended meaning to compare locations across boroughs or within an
    incorrect geographic context.

  - The question asks whether "HOPE GARDEN, Manhattan" is located south of "STANTON
    STREET COURTS, Manhattan." The ambiguity arises from the fact that "HOPE GARDEN"
    could refer to multiple locations, or it might not be a well-documented location
    in Manhattan, leading to different possible interpretations of what specific place
    is being referred to. Additionally, without clear definitions or widely recognized
    locations for these names, determining a precise answer could be challenging.
    Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation due to the potential
    ambiguity in identifying the locations mentioned.
  - 'The question asks about the relative location of two places in Manhattan: HOPE
    GARDEN and STANTON STREET COURTS. The query is clear in its request for a geographical
    comparison based on direction, specifically asking if one place is located south

    could potentially be named "HOPE GARDEN" or "STANTON STREET COURTS" within Manhattan
    or nearby areas. Without specific addresses or additional context, the question
    may admit different interpretations based on which locations are being referred
    to. Thus, it is ambiguous because it relies on the assumption that the reader
    knows which specific places are being referenced.'
  - The question asks about the relative locations of "HOPE GARDEN, Manhattan" and
    "STANTON STREET COURTS, Manhattan" in terms of their geographical positioning
    in New York City. The question seems to assume that both locations are well-defined
    and known places in Manhattan. However, the ambiguity arises because "HOPE GARDEN"
    is not a well-known or officially recognized location in Manhattan, leading to
    uncertainty about its exact position. Without a clear definition of where "HOPE
    GARDEN" is, the question admits multiple interpretations regarding its location.
    Therefore, it is unclear whether "HOPE GARDEN" is indeed south of "STANTON STREET
    COURTS," as the exact location of "HOPE GARDEN" is not established.
  - The question asks if "HOPE GARDEN, Manhattan" is located south of "STANTON STREET
    COURTS, Manhattan." For this question to be clear, both locations need to be precisely
    identifiable in Manhattan, NYC. If there is only one "HOPE GARDEN" and one "STANTON
    STREET COURTS" in Manhattan, then the question is clear and admits one correct
    answer based on geographic information. However, if there are multiple locations
    with similar names or if these places are not well-defined, the question could
    be considered ambiguous. Without additional context or specific geographic information,
    it is difficult to determine if the question is clear or ambiguous. Therefore,
    based on the potential for multiple interpretations or lack of precise identification
    of the locations, the question is ambiguous.
  - The question asks whether "HOPE GARDEN, Manhattan" is located south of "STANTON
    STREET COURTS, Manhattan" in New York City. The question is specific in its request

    the question is ambiguous because there are multiple places that could be referred
    to as "HOPE GARDEN" in Manhattan, and without additional context or specific addresses,
    it is unclear which "HOPE GARDEN" is being referenced. Therefore, this could lead
    to different interpretations and answers depending on the assumed location of
    "HOPE GARDEN."

  - The question involves geographic locations and their relative positions. However,
    the question is ambiguous for several reasons. First, it is not clear if "13 FL"
    refers to the 13th floor of a building or if it's part of the address, which could
    affect the interpretation of the question. Additionally, the names of the locations
    are not provided with specific addresses, which makes it difficult to accurately
    determine their geographic positions relative to each other without further information.

    standard address format. It is unclear whether "13 FL" refers to a floor number
    within a building or an abbreviation for a street address, which could impact
    the interpretation of the location. Thus, the question could have multiple interpretations
    depending on the address format and the specific location of the consulate. Furthermore,

    Avenue over SIRT S SHR in Staten Island. The question involves geographic locations,
    and its interpretation relies on understanding the relative positions of these
    two specific locations. However, it is ambiguous because it involves comparing
    places in two different boroughs (Brooklyn and Staten Island), which do not have
    a straightforward north-south relationship due to the overall orientation and
    shape of New York City. Additionally, the question may be interpreted differently
    depending on how one defines "south" in a non-linear urban context. Thus, it admits
    more than one interpretation regarding the geographic relationship between these
    locations.
  - The question is asking about the relative geographic location of Luna Park Houses
    in Brooklyn and a location described as "Bancroft Avenue OVR SIRT S SHR" in Staten
    Island. The use of "OVR SIRT S SHR" is unclear and could refer to a specific point,

    of these locations might not be well-defined or commonly known, which could lead
    to different interpretations about what is being considered as the "location"
    of each place. Furthermore, the question involves comparing locations across two
    different boroughs (Manhattan and Queens), which could add complexity depending
    on how boundaries are interpreted. Therefore, the question admits more than one
    interpretation regarding the exact locations being compared, leading to potential
    different answers.

  - The question asks whether Terrace Playground in Staten Island is located south
    of PS 207 Elizabeth G Leary in Brooklyn. The question is geographically based
    and involves determining the relative location of two specific places. However,
    the interpretation can be ambiguous because it depends on the specific criteria
    for "south" and the precise locations of these places. For instance, considering
    the general orientation of Staten Island and Brooklyn, it could be interpreted
    in terms of a straight line south, or it could involve more nuanced geographical
    considerations (e.g., as the crow flies versus road distance). Furthermore, without
    exact addresses or coordinates, determining a definitive answer may be challenging.
  - The question asks whether Terrace Playground in Staten Island is located south
    of PS 207 Elizabeth G Leary in Brooklyn. This is a geographical question that
    requires comparing the locations of two specific places. The interpretation hinges

  - The question asks about the relative location of TERRACE PLAYGROUND in Staten
    Island and PS 207 ELIZABETH G LEARY in Brooklyn. The question is specific in its
    request to determine if one location is south of the other. However, there is
    an inherent ambiguity because the question involves locations in different boroughs
    of New York City (Staten Island and Brooklyn), making the concept of "south" relative
    and potentially unclear without a specific frame of reference or additional geographic
    context. This could lead to different interpretations depending on how one defines
    "south" in the context of locations in separate boroughs.
  - The question asks whether Terrace Playground in Staten Island is located south
    of PS 207 Elizabeth G Leary in Brooklyn. This is a geographical question that
