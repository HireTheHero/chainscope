    can be answered definitively. Therefore, it admits one interpretation and one
    correct answer based on that data.
  - The question asks for a comparison of height between Scarlett Johansson and Ariana
    Grande. The question seems straightforward as it is asking who is shorter in terms
    of height. However, it requires current and accurate data on their heights, which
    might not be universally agreed upon due to variations in reported heights. Furthermore,
