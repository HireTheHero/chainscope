    because it involves comparing two historical dates: the completion date of the
    Empire State Building (1931) and the completion date of the Panama Canal (1914).
    Since the dates are distinct and factual, the question has a single, definitive

  - The question "Was the Taj Mahal completed before the Great Wall of China Ming
    Dynasty?" is AMBIGUOUS because it involves comparing the completion dates of two
    structures, but the Great Wall of China was built over several dynasties, including
    the Ming Dynasty. The Ming Dynasty contributions to the Great Wall were completed
    in the 17th century, while the Taj Mahal was completed in 1643. However, the question
    does not specify which part of the Great Wall or which period of the Ming Dynasty
    construction it refers to, leading to multiple interpretations. Therefore, the
    question can lead to different answers depending on the interpretation of which
    part of the Great Wall or which phase of its construction is being compared.
  - "The question asks about the completion dates of two historical structures: the\
    \ Taj Mahal and the Great Wall of China during the Ming Dynasty. The Taj Mahal\
    \ was completed in 1643, whereas the Great Wall's construction spans multiple\
    \ dynasties, with significant portions built during the Ming Dynasty (1368\u2013\
    1644). The ambiguity arises because the Great Wall was not a single project with\
    \ a definitive completion date; rather, it consists of multiple sections built\
    \ at different times. Therefore, the question could be interpreted as comparing\
    \ the completion of the Taj Mahal to the completion of any part of the Ming Dynasty's\
    \ contributions to the Great Wall, leading to different answers depending on interpretation."
  - "The question asks about the completion times of two historical structures: the\
    \ Taj Mahal and the Great Wall of China during the Ming Dynasty. The Taj Mahal\
    \ was completed in 1643, while the construction of the Great Wall of China spanned\
    \ several dynasties, with significant work done during the Ming Dynasty (1368\u2013\
    1644). The ambiguity arises from the lack of specificity regarding which part\
    \ or phase of the Great Wall's construction is being referred to. Since the Great\
    \ Wall had sections built and rebuilt over many centuries, it is not clear whether\
    \ the question refers to the entire wall or specific Ming Dynasty contributions.\
    \ Therefore, the question can be interpreted in multiple ways, depending on the\
    \ understanding of the completion of the Great Wall during the Ming Dynasty."
  - 'The question is asking about the completion dates of two historical structures:
    the Taj Mahal and the Great Wall of China during the Ming Dynasty. The Taj Mahal
    was completed in 1643, while the Ming Dynasty''s work on the Great Wall was completed
    in 1644. The question is clear in its reference to the specific Ming Dynasty period
    of the Great Wall. Therefore, the question admits only one interpretation, focusing
    on a specific timeframe, which leads to a single correct answer.'
  - 'The question is asking about the completion dates of two historical structures:
    the Taj Mahal and the Great Wall of China during the Ming Dynasty. However, it
    is ambiguous because the Great Wall of China is a complex structure with different
    sections built and rebuilt over centuries, especially during the Ming Dynasty.
    The question does not specify which part or phase of the Great Wall is being referred
    to. The Taj Mahal, on the other hand, has a clear completion date in 1643. Without
    specifying which portion or completion phase of the Great Wall during the Ming
    Dynasty is in question, the query can lead to different interpretations and answers.'
  - 'The question asks whether the Taj Mahal was completed before the Ming Dynasty
    section of the Great Wall of China. The Taj Mahal was completed in 1643. The Ming
    Dynasty section of the Great Wall was primarily built during the Ming Dynasty,
    which lasted from 1368 to 1644. The question is clear because it specifies the
    Ming Dynasty section of the Great Wall, allowing for a direct comparison of completion
    dates between the two. Therefore, the question admits one interpretation and one
    correct answer: the Taj Mahal was completed after the Great Wall of China''s Ming
    Dynasty section.'
  - The question asks whether the Taj Mahal was completed before the Great Wall of
    China during the Ming Dynasty. This question is ambiguous because it involves
    comparing the completion dates of two structures that belong to different historical
    contexts. The Taj Mahal, completed in 1643, was built during the Mughal Empire
    in India, while the Great Wall of China was constructed over several dynasties,
    with significant work done during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). The ambiguity
    arises from the interpretation of "completed" in the context of the Great Wall,
    as it was not completed in a singular event but rather continuously built and
    maintained over centuries. Additionally, the question does not specify which particular
    section or phase of the Great Wall is being referenced.
  - 'The question is asking about the completion dates of two historical structures:
    the Taj Mahal and the Great Wall of China during the Ming Dynasty. The Taj Mahal
    was completed in 1643, while the Great Wall of China, as it exists today, was
    significantly rebuilt and extended during the Ming Dynasty, which lasted from
    1368 to 1644. The ambiguity arises because the Great Wall of China is not a single
    construction project but a series of fortifications built and rebuilt over many
    centuries. The question does not specify which part or phase of the Great Wall
    during the Ming Dynasty is being referred to, making it open to interpretation
    whether the question is asking about the entire duration of the Ming Dynasty''s
    involvement with the wall or a specific segment. This could lead to different
    answers depending on the interpretation.'
  - The question asks if the Taj Mahal was completed before the Great Wall of China
    during the Ming Dynasty. The question is slightly ambiguous because the Great
    Wall of China is a structure that was built and rebuilt over various dynasties,
    including the Ming Dynasty. The Ming Dynasty's section of the Great Wall was constructed
    primarily between the 14th and 17th centuries. The Taj Mahal, on the other hand,
    was completed in 1643. To answer this question accurately, one would need to know
    specific details about which part of the Ming Dynasty's Great Wall is being referred
    to, as construction occurred over a long period. Therefore, the question admits
    more than one interpretation regarding the timing of completion.
  - 'The question is asking about the completion dates of two historical structures:
    the Taj Mahal and the Great Wall of China during the Ming Dynasty. The Taj Mahal
    was completed in 1643, while the Ming Dynasty''s reconstruction and fortification
    of the Great Wall were completed in the late 16th century, around the 1570s. Therefore,
    the Taj Mahal was completed after the Great Wall of China''s Ming Dynasty section.
    The question is clear and admits only one interpretation regarding the timeline
    of these two constructions.'

  - 'The question asks whether the completion of the Hoover Dam occurred before that

    was then taken over by the United States, and the canal was officially completed
    and opened in 1914. The Eiffel Tower was completed in 1889. If we consider the
    completion of the canal as the date it was opened in 1914, then the Eiffel Tower

    date. This leads to multiple interpretations and possible answers.
