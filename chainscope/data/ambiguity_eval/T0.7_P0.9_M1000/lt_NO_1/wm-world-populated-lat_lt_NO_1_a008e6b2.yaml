  - The question asks if Thiruvananthapuram is located south of the Thiruvananthapuram
    metropolitan area. This question is inherently contradictory and ambiguous because
    Thiruvananthapuram cannot be south of itself; a location cannot be in a position
    relative to itself. The phrasing suggests a misunderstanding or a typographical
    error in the question, leading to multiple possible interpretations such as asking
    about a specific part of Thiruvananthapuram or a comparison to another location.
    Therefore, the question is ambiguous.
  - The question asks if Thiruvananthapuram is located south of the Thiruvananthapuram
    metropolitan area. This is inherently ambiguous because Thiruvananthapuram itself
    is the central part of the metropolitan area, making it impossible for it to be
    located "south of" itself. The phrasing suggests a misunderstanding or a misstatement
    regarding geographic locations, leading to multiple interpretations or confusion
    about what the question intends to ask.
  - The question asks if Thiruvananthapuram is located south of the Thiruvananthapuram
    metropolitan area. This is inherently contradictory because Thiruvananthapuram,
    being a part of its own metropolitan area, cannot be located south of itself.
    The question seems to confuse the geographic location of Thiruvananthapuram relative
    to its own metropolitan region, which does not allow for multiple interpretations.
    However, the question is nonsensical in its formulation, as it essentially asks
    if something can be south of itself, which is not possible. Therefore, the question
    is ambiguous in its logic but not in its interpretation.
  - The question asks whether Thiruvananthapuram is located south of the Thiruvananthapuram
    metropolitan area. This question is inherently ambiguous because Thiruvananthapuram
    is the central city within its metropolitan area. Therefore, it cannot be located

    is meant by "south of Thiruvananthapuram metropolitan area," leading to multiple
    interpretations and no clear, single correct answer.
  - The question asks if Thiruvananthapuram is located south of the Thiruvananthapuram
    metropolitan area. This is ambiguous because Thiruvananthapuram itself is a city
    and is part of the metropolitan area. Thus, it does not make sense to ask if a
    place is south of itself, leading to multiple interpretations. One might consider
    whether a specific location within Thiruvananthapuram is south of the metropolitan
    area's central point, but the question as phrased does not provide enough clarity
    for a single interpretation.
  - The question is asking if Thiruvananthapuram is located south of the Thiruvananthapuram
    metropolitan area. This is ambiguous because Thiruvananthapuram cannot be south
    of itself. The question seems to be incorrectly phrased or suggests a misunderstanding

    confusion and different interpretations regarding the relationship between Thiruvananthapuram
    and its metropolitan area.
  - The question asks if Thiruvananthapuram is located south of the Thiruvananthapuram
    metropolitan area. This is ambiguous because it refers to the same location both
    as a city and as a metropolitan area, leading to confusion. Typically, a city
    cannot be south of itself, and without additional context, it's unclear what is
    meant by "south of Thiruvananthapuram metropolitan area." Therefore, the question
    admits more than one interpretation and could lead to different answers.
  - The question is asking if Thiruvananthapuram is located south of the Thiruvananthapuram
    metropolitan area. This is ambiguous because Thiruvananthapuram and the Thiruvananthapuram
    metropolitan area refer to the same location, making it unclear how one could

    as asking if a specific part of the city is south of the broader metropolitan
    area, or it could simply be a misunderstanding of geographical terms.
  - The question is asking if Thiruvananthapuram is located south of the Thiruvananthapuram
    metropolitan area. This is inherently ambiguous because Thiruvananthapuram and
    its metropolitan area refer to the same region, and it is not possible for a location
    to be south of itself. Additionally, the phrasing suggests a misunderstanding
    of geographical terms, leading to multiple possible interpretations about what
    is being asked regarding location within the same area.

    'Rurrenabaque' is a town in Bolivia, but without clarity on what 'Ili'ili' is,
    there could be multiple interpretations or assumptions about its location. This
    makes the question ambiguous, as it does not provide enough information to determine
    a single correct answer.
  - The question asks about the relative location of 'Ili'ili in relation to Rurrenabaque.
    For this to be clear, the locations of both 'Ili'ili and Rurrenabaque need to
    be well-defined and known. 'Ili'ili could refer to a place in American Samoa,
    while Rurrenabaque is a town in Bolivia. Assuming these are the intended locations,
    the question is clear and can be answered with a yes or no. However, if 'Ili'ili
    refers to another place or is not known, the question could become ambiguous.
    Given the most common reference for 'Ili'ili, the question is clear.
  - The question is asking whether a specific place, 'Ili'ili, is located south of
    another specific place, Rurrenabaque. However, the ambiguity arises from the fact

  - 'The question asks if Mbulu District is located south of Fernando de Noronha.
    It is clear in its geographic inquiry and involves comparing the latitudinal positions
    of two specific locations: Mbulu District and Fernando de Noronha. There is only
    one interpretation for this question, which involves checking the geographic coordinates
    of both places to determine their relative positions. The question does not present
    multiple interpretations or require subjective judgment.'
  - 'The question asks about the relative location of Mbulu District in relation to
    Fernando de Noronha. This is a geographical question that typically admits one
    interpretation: determining whether one place is geographically south of another.
    However, the ambiguity arises due to the lack of specific reference points or
    definitions for "south" in terms of distance or direction. If interpreted strictly
    in terms of latitude, the question may have a clear answer. However, without additional
    context or clarification, the question could be interpreted differently, leading
    to potential ambiguity.'
  - The question asks if Mbulu District is located south of Fernando de Noronha. This
    question involves geographical locations. Mbulu District is in Tanzania, Africa,
    and Fernando de Noronha is an archipelago off the coast of Brazil in the Atlantic
    Ocean. The interpretation of "south" here is straightforward, as it refers to
    the relative positioning on a map. However, the phrasing could lead to different
    interpretations regarding what specific point of each location is being considered.
    Despite this, the general understanding of geographic positioning on a map provides
    a clear answer based on latitude.
  - The question asks whether Mbulu District is located south of Fernando de Noronha.
    This question could be seen as CLEAR if we interpret it strictly as a geographical
    question asking for a simple north-south comparison between two locations. However,
    it could also be seen as AMBIGUOUS because the question does not specify the context
    or purpose of the comparison, nor does it provide a reference point for what "south"
    means (e.g., in terms of latitude, cultural context, or political boundaries).
    Additionally, the question does not specify which Mbulu District is being referred
    to, as there could be multiple places with similar names, potentially leading
    to different answers based on interpretation.
  - The question asks if Mbulu District is located south of Fernando de Noronha. To
    determine if the question is clear or ambiguous, we need to assess whether the
    geographical locations and the directional relationship between them are straightforward.
    Mbulu District is in Tanzania, while Fernando de Noronha is an archipelago in
    Brazil. Given that Tanzania is on the African continent and Brazil is in South
    America, and considering their latitudinal positions, the relationship in terms
    of "south" is clear. Mbulu District is north of Fernando de Noronha. Therefore,
    the question has a clear interpretation and a single correct answer.
  - The question is asking about the geographical location of Mbulu District in relation
    to Fernando de Noronha. This question is specific and asks for a relative positioning
    on the Earth's surface, which is a factual inquiry. Both Mbulu District and Fernando
    de Noronha are distinct geographical locations, and their relative positions can
    be determined accurately using a map. Therefore, the question admits only one
    interpretation and one correct answer based on geographical data.
  - 'The question asks whether Mbulu District is located south of Fernando de Noronha.
    Geographically, Mbulu District is in Tanzania, and Fernando de Noronha is an archipelago
    in Brazil. The question is clear in asking for a geographic comparison in terms
    of latitude, and there is only one correct answer: Mbulu District is located south
    of Fernando de Noronha. Therefore, the question admits only one interpretation
    and one correct answer.'
  - 'The question asks if Mbulu District is located south of Fernando de Noronha.
    The question is geographically specific, referring to two distinct places: Mbulu
    District and Fernando de Noronha. There is only one interpretation: determining
    the relative position of these two locations. Therefore, the question is clear
    in its intent and admits a single correct answer based on geographical data.'
  - The question is asking about the geographical location of Mbulu District in relation
    to Fernando de Noronha. However, the question could be interpreted in different
    ways due to the lack of specificity about what "south" refers to. "South" could
    mean directly south or generally in the southern direction, and it might not account
    for the curvature of the Earth or specific coordinates. Additionally, without
    clear context about the reference point or the type of map projection used, this
    question can lead to different interpretations. Thus, the question is ambiguous.
  - The question asks about the geographical location of Mbulu District in relation
    to Fernando de Noronha. To determine if the question is clear or ambiguous, we
    need to consider if there is only one interpretation. Mbulu District is a specific
    location in Tanzania, and Fernando de Noronha is an archipelago in Brazil. Geographically,
    Mbulu District is indeed located south of Fernando de Noronha. Since there is
    only one correct interpretation regarding their relative positions on the globe,
    the question is clear.

  - The question asks whether Andisheh is located south of Wilson County, North Carolina.
    This question can be considered AMBIGUOUS because it depends on the interpretation
    of "Andisheh." Andisheh could refer to a place in Iran, and if this is the intended
    interpretation, the question would have a clear answer (as it is located east
    of Wilson County, North Carolina, not south). However, if there is another location
    named Andisheh closer to Wilson County, the answer might differ. Without additional
    context to clarify which Andisheh is being referenced, the question admits more
    than one interpretation, which could lead to different answers.
  - 'The question asks whether Andisheh is located south of Wilson County, North Carolina.
    It implies a geographical relationship between two places: Andisheh and Wilson
    County. However, the question is ambiguous because "Andisheh" could refer to multiple
    places worldwide, such as Andisheh in Iran or other locations with similar names.
    Without specifying which Andisheh is being referenced, the question admits more
    than one interpretation, potentially leading to different answers depending on
    the assumed location of Andisheh.'
  - The question asks whether Andisheh is located south of Wilson County, North Carolina.
    However, the question is ambiguous because "Andisheh" could refer to multiple
    places or entities, such as a city in Iran or a neighborhood in another country.

    the correct geographical relationship between Andisheh and Wilson County, North
    Carolina. This lack of specificity leads to multiple possible interpretations
    and answers.
  - The question is asking about the relative geographic location of Andisheh in relation
    to Wilson County, North Carolina. It seems to imply a straightforward geographic
    query. However, there is ambiguity because "Andisheh" is not widely known or associated
    with a specific place without additional context. There could be multiple places
    named Andisheh or it could be a less-known location that is not commonly recognized.
    Without further context, it is unclear which Andisheh is being referred to, leading
    to different interpretations and potential answers.
  - The question asks about the relative location of Andisheh in relation to Wilson
    County, North Carolina. The question is potentially ambiguous because "Andisheh"
    could refer to different places depending on the context (e.g., a city in Iran
    or a name used elsewhere). Without additional context specifying which Andisheh
    is being referred to, the question could be interpreted in multiple ways, leading
    to different answers based on the assumed location of Andisheh.
  - 'The question asks if Andisheh is located south of Wilson County, North Carolina.
    The interpretation of the question is straightforward, as it asks for a specific
    geographical relationship between two locations: Andisheh and Wilson County. The
    answer depends on factual geographical data, specifically the relative positions
    of Andisheh and Wilson County. There is only one correct geographical fact regarding
    their relative positions, making the question clear in its intent and interpretation.'
  - The question asks if Andisheh is located south of Wilson County, North Carolina.
    The question is ambiguous because "Andisheh" could refer to multiple places or
    concepts depending on context, and without specifying which Andisheh is being
    referred to, the question could lead to different interpretations. Additionally,
    the question does not specify which country or context "Andisheh" refers to, which
    further contributes to its ambiguity.
  - 'The question asks whether Andisheh is located south of Wilson County, North Carolina.
    This is a straightforward geographical question. Andisheh is a city in Iran, and
    Wilson County is in North Carolina, USA. Given the vast distance and clear geographical
    separation between the two locations, the interpretation of the question is straightforward
    and admits only one correct answer: Yes, Andisheh is indeed located south of Wilson
    County, North Carolina. There is no ambiguity in interpreting the geographical
    relationship between these two places.'

  - The question "Is Rothera Research Station located south of Argentine Antarctica?"
    is ambiguous because it can be interpreted in different ways based on what "south
    of Argentine Antarctica" means. Argentine Antarctica is a sector claimed by Argentina
    in Antarctica, and "south" could be interpreted in terms of the polar coordinate
    system or relative to specific points or boundaries within Argentine Antarctica.
    Additionally, Rothera Research Station is located on Adelaide Island, which is
    part of the Antarctic Peninsula region, making its relative position to Argentine
    Antarctica potentially open to interpretation depending on different geographical
    perspectives or definitions of "south." Therefore, the question does not have
    a single, clear interpretation or answer.
  - The question asks about the location of Rothera Research Station in relation to
    "Argentine Antarctica." The term "Argentine Antarctica" could refer to a specific
    region claimed by Argentina, but such territorial claims are not universally recognized.
    This could lead to different interpretations of what constitutes "south of Argentine
    Antarctica." Additionally, Rothera Research Station is located on Adelaide Island,
    which is part of the British Antarctic Territory and can be considered south of
    mainland Argentina but may not be considered south if one interprets "Argentine
    Antarctica" as including the Argentine Antarctic claim. These different interpretations
    could lead to different answers, making the question ambiguous.
  - The question is asking about the geographical location of Rothera Research Station
    in relation to "Argentine Antarctica." However, "Argentine Antarctica" is not
    a precise geographical term and can be interpreted in different ways. It might
    refer to the area claimed by Argentina in Antarctica, which overlaps with other
    territorial claims and is not universally recognized. This ambiguity in the term
    "Argentine Antarctica" leads to different possible interpretations of the question,
    as the boundaries of such a region are not clearly defined internationally. Therefore,
    the question admits more than one interpretation, which could lead to different
    answers depending on how one defines "Argentine Antarctica."
  - The question asks whether Rothera Research Station is located south of Argentine
    Antarctica. The term "Argentine Antarctica" typically refers to the portion of
    Antarctica claimed by Argentina. However, there is ambiguity in the phrasing of
    the question because "south of Argentine Antarctica" could imply being further
    into Antarctica from the perspective of Argentina, or it could refer to a specific
    direction relative to the claimed territory. The interpretation of "south" in
    the context of Antarctic geography is not straightforward due to the continent's
    location at the southernmost part of the Earth, where traditional directions become
    less clear. As such, the question can be interpreted in multiple ways, leading
    to potential different answers depending on the interpretation of "south" and
    the boundaries of Argentine Antarctica. Therefore, the question admits more than
    one interpretation.
  - The question asks whether Rothera Research Station is located south of Argentine
    Antarctica. The interpretation of the question hinges on the geographical positioning
    of Rothera Research Station in relation to Argentine Antarctica. However, "Argentine
    Antarctica" typically refers to the sector of Antarctica claimed by Argentina,
    which is in the northern part of the Antarctic Peninsula. Since Rothera Research
    Station is located on Adelaide Island, which is part of the Antarctic Peninsula,
    it is generally understood to be located north of the sector commonly referred
    to as Argentine Antarctica. Therefore, the question admits one interpretation
    regarding the geographical locations involved, and there is one clear answer based
    on known geographical data.
  - The question asks whether Rothera Research Station is located south of Argentine
    Antarctica. This can be interpreted in different ways because "Argentine Antarctica"
    is a region claimed by Argentina, and its boundaries might not be universally
    recognized or clear. The question does not specify which particular geographic
    coordinates or boundaries are being referred to, which could lead to multiple
    interpretations. Additionally, the term "south of" could be interpreted differently
    depending on the perspective taken (e.g., from the central point of the claimed
    territory or its southernmost point).
  - The question is asking about the geographic location of the Rothera Research Station
    in relation to Argentine Antarctica. However, the term "Argentine Antarctica"
    could refer to the sector claimed by Argentina on the Antarctic continent, and
    "south of Argentine Antarctica" could imply a direction relative to this claim.
    The interpretation depends on the understanding of "Argentine Antarctica," which
    could lead to different answers based on different interpretations of territorial
    claims and geographic positioning. This makes the question ambiguous.
  - The question asks about the geographical location of the Rothera Research Station
    in relation to Argentine Antarctica. The interpretation could vary based on understanding
    what "south of Argentine Antarctica" means. Argentine Antarctica refers to the
    portion of Antarctica claimed by Argentina, which is in the northern part of the
    Antarctic Peninsula. The Rothera Research Station is located on Adelaide Island,
    which is part of the Antarctic Peninsula and is generally southwest of the claimed
    Argentine sector. The ambiguity arises because "south of Argentine Antarctica"
    could be interpreted differently depending on whether one considers the claimed
    sector or the actual geographic direction. Therefore, the question is open to
    multiple interpretations based on these considerations.
  - The question asks whether Rothera Research Station is located south of Argentine
    Antarctica. This can be interpreted in multiple ways because "Argentine Antarctica"
    refers to a sector claimed by Argentina in Antarctica, and "south of" could mean
    relative to the whole sector or a specific point within it. Additionally, geographical
    directions in Antarctica can be complex due to the continent's circular nature
    around the South Pole. Therefore, the question could lead to different answers
    depending on the interpretation of "south of Argentine Antarctica."
  - "The question asks about the location of Rothera Research Station in relation\
    \ to \"Argentine Antarctica.\" The term \"Argentine Antarctica\" could refer to\
    \ the area of Antarctica claimed by Argentina, which is known as \"Argentine Antarctica\"\
    \ or \"Ant\xE1rtida Argentina.\" However, since Antarctica is a continent with\
    \ overlapping territorial claims, the interpretation of \"south of Argentine Antarctica\"\
    \ can be unclear. The question could be interpreted as asking if the station is\
    \ geographically south of the area claimed by Argentina, or it could be asking\
    \ if it is within the claimed territory. These different interpretations could\
    \ lead to different answers, making the question ambiguous."

    which Huayin or Haenam County is being referred to, the question is ambiguous.'
  - The question is asking about the relative geographical location of Huayin and
    Haenam County. However, it is ambiguous because there could be multiple places
    named "Huayin" and "Haenam County" in different parts of the world. Without specifying
    which "Huayin" and "Haenam County" are being referred to, the question can lead
    to different interpretations and answers. Additionally, even if the intended locations
    are identified, the concept of "south" could be subject to interpretation depending
    on the map projection or local geographical considerations.
  - The question asks whether Huayin is located south of Haenam County. However, it
    is ambiguous because it does not specify which Huayin is being referred to, as
    there may be multiple places named Huayin. Additionally, without a clear context
    or additional geographical information, it is challenging to determine the relative
    locations definitively. This lack of specificity in identifying the exact locations
    makes the question open to multiple interpretations and potential answers.
  - The question asks whether Huayin is located south of Haenam County. This question
    is ambiguous because "Huayin" could refer to different places depending on the
    context. For instance, Huayin could refer to a city in China, while Haenam County
    is in South Korea. Without additional context specifying which Huayin is being
    referred to, the question admits more than one interpretation and could lead to
    different answers based on the assumed locations of Huayin and Haenam County.
  - The question asks if Huayin is located south of Haenam County. This question could
    be interpreted in different ways due to the lack of specific context or disambiguation.
    "Huayin" could refer to different places depending on the country or region in
    question. Without specifying the country or region, it's unclear whether the question
    is asking about Huayin in China or some other place with a similar name. Similarly,
    "Haenam County" is a specific location in South Korea, but without context, the
    relationship between these locations is not clear. The question could therefore
    be interpreted differently depending on which Huayin is being considered.

  - The question "Is Sotra located south of Viikki?" is ambiguous because it involves
    two geographic locations without specifying which Sotra or Viikki is being referenced.
    There could be multiple places named Sotra or Viikki in different parts of the
    world, leading to different interpretations and answers depending on which locations
    the question refers to.
  - The question asks whether "Sotra" is located south of "Viikki." To classify this,
    we need to identify both locations clearly. "Sotra" is a group of islands in Norway,
    while "Viikki" is a district in Helsinki, Finland. The question is geographically
    specific and does not have multiple interpretations regarding the locations in
    question. The only interpretation is whether the islands of Sotra are geographically
    south of the district of Viikki, which can be determined by looking at a map or
    geographic data. The question is clear in its intent and what it is asking about,
    thus leading to one correct answer based on geographic coordinates.
  - The question asks if Sotra is located south of Viikki. To determine if this question
    is clear or ambiguous, we need to consider the specificity of the locations mentioned.
    Sotra is a well-defined island in Norway, while Viikki is a district in Helsinki,
    Finland. The question is geographically straightforward as it pertains to the
    relative positioning of two distinct places. However, depending on the context
    or additional meaning the question could imply, there could be ambiguity. For
    instance, if the question is meant to be metaphorical or if there are other places
    named Sotra or Viikki, the interpretation could change. However, based solely
    on the most common geographic references, Sotra (Norway) is not south of Viikki
    (Finland), thus leading to a clear answer. Given the lack of explicit context
    suggesting otherwise, the question can be considered clear.
  - The question asks whether Sotra is located south of Viikki. However, without additional
    context, it is unclear which Sotra or Viikki the question refers to, as there
    could be multiple places with those names in different parts of the world. This
    lack of specificity leads to multiple possible interpretations, resulting in potential
    different answers depending on the specific locations intended.
  - The question asks about the relative location of Sotra and Viikki. For this question
    to be clear, the locations of Sotra and Viikki must be well-defined and known.
    However, "Sotra" could refer to different places, such as an island in Norway,
    and "Viikki" is a district in Helsinki, Finland. Without specific context or additional
    information to confirm which "Sotra" is being referred to, the question could
    be interpreted in multiple ways, depending on which Sotra is in question. This
    leads to ambiguity in determining a single correct answer.
  - The question asks if "Sotra" is located south of "Viikki." To determine if the
    question is clear or ambiguous, we must consider the specific locations involved.
    "Sotra" likely refers to an island in Norway, while "Viikki" is a district in
    Helsinki, Finland. Given these common interpretations, the question can be answered
    with a straightforward geographical comparison. However, without additional context,
    there could be multiple places named "Sotra" or "Viikki" in different parts of
    the world. This lack of specificity in the names of the places introduces ambiguity,
    as different interpretations could lead to different answers depending on which
    "Sotra" or "Viikki" one is referring to.
  - The question asks whether Sotra is located south of Viikki. To determine if the
    question is clear or ambiguous, we need to consider the geographical locations
    of Sotra and Viikki. Sotra is an island in Norway, while Viikki is a district
    in Helsinki, Finland. The question is straightforward in asking for the relative
    geographical position of Sotra in relation to Viikki. There is only one interpretation
    of the question, which involves checking a map to determine the cardinal direction
    from Viikki to Sotra. Therefore, the question admits one interpretation and one
    correct answer based on geographical data.
  - 'The question asks whether Sotra is located south of Viikki. To answer this, one
    needs to know the geographical locations of both Sotra and Viikki. Sotra is an
    island in Norway, while Viikki is a district in Helsinki, Finland. Given the specific
    locations of these places, the question can be interpreted in only one way: determining
    the relative north-south position of these two locations on a map. Since Sotra
    is indeed located south of Viikki, the question admits only one interpretation
    and one correct answer.'
  - "The question asks if Sotra is located south of Viikki. To determine if the question\
    \ is clear or ambiguous, we need to consider if Sotra and Viikki are well-defined\
    \ geographical locations and if their relative positions can be unambiguously\
    \ determined. \n\nSotra is an island in Norway, while Viikki is a district in\
    \ Helsinki, Finland. The locations of Sotra and Viikki are fixed and can be precisely\
    \ determined using geographical coordinates. Therefore, the question of whether\
    \ Sotra is south of Viikki has a single, clear answer based on these fixed geographical\
    \ facts.\n\nThus, the question admits only one interpretation and one correct\
    \ answer based on objective geographic data."
  - 'The question "Is Sotra located south of Viikki?" is asking for a geographic relationship
    between two places: Sotra and Viikki. However, without specifying the context
    or providing additional information about these locations, the question could
    be ambiguous. "Sotra" could refer to an island in Norway, while "Viikki" is a
    district in Helsinki, Finland. Assuming these are the intended locations, the
    question is clear because geographic locations can be determined definitively.
    However, if "Sotra" and "Viikki" could refer to other places with the same names
    elsewhere in the world, the question could be ambiguous. Without further context,
    the interpretation hinges on the most well-known locations. Given this consideration,
    the question leans towards being clear if it is assumed to refer to the most recognized
    places by those names.'

    location of Medlar-with-Wesham to any Thornton, but the mention of West Yorkshire
    suggests a specific Thornton. Despite this, the question is ultimately asking
    about a specific, factual geographical relationship, which makes it more clear.
    However, the potential for confusion about which Thornton is intended adds a layer
    of ambiguity.
  - The question asks if Medlar-with-Wesham is located south of Thornton, West Yorkshire.
    The ambiguity arises because there are multiple places named Thornton in the UK,
    including one in West Yorkshire and another in Lancashire. The question does not
    specify which Thornton it refers to, thus leading to different interpretations
    and potential answers based on the location of the Thornton in question.

  - "The question asks whether Amarynthos is located south of Vulcano. To classify\
    \ this question as CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS, we need to consider if it can be interpreted\
    \ in more than one way. \n\nFirst, let's identify the locations: \n- Amarynthos\
    \ is a town in Greece.\n- Vulcano is an island in Italy.\n\nThe question seems\
    \ to be straightforward in asking about the geographical positioning of Amarynthos\
    \ in relation to Vulcano, which is a factual inquiry about their relative locations\

  - The question "Is Amarynthos located south of Vulcano?" appears to be straightforward
    at first glance, asking about the relative geographical positions of two places.
    However, the ambiguity arises from the fact that there could be multiple places
    named Amarynthos and Vulcano around the world. Without specifying which Amarynthos
    and which Vulcano are being referred to, the question can be interpreted in multiple
    ways, leading to different answers. For instance, Amarynthos could refer to a
    location in Greece, and Vulcano could refer to a place in Italy, but there could
    be other places with the same names elsewhere. This lack of specificity makes
    the question ambiguous.
  - The question asks whether Amarynthos is located south of Vulcano. The question
    seems straightforward, but the ambiguity arises from the fact that the question
    doesn't specify which "Vulcano" it is referring to. There is a Vulcano island
    in Italy, part of the Aeolian Islands, but without this specification, it could
    also be mistakenly interpreted as a generic term for any volcanic location named
    "Vulcano." Additionally, without the exact coordinates or additional context for
    Amarynthos (a town in Greece), the question could lead to different interpretations
    regarding geographical location or intent.
  - 'The question "Is Amarynthos located south of Vulcano?" is AMBIGUOUS. It involves
    two geographical locations: Amarynthos and Vulcano. Amarynthos is a town in Greece,
    and Vulcano is an island in Italy. The ambiguity arises because the question does
    not specify which coordinate system or point of reference is being used to determine
    "south." Different interpretations could lead to different answers, such as whether
    one is considering latitude or a different method of measuring "south." Additionally,
    without clear context or parameters for what is considered "south," the question
    admits multiple interpretations.'

    answers depending on which specific places the question refers to. Additionally,
    the lack of specific reference points or maps makes it difficult to determine
    the exact relationship. Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation.
  - The question asks if "Mahis" is located south of "Qibya." For this question to
    be clear, both locations need to be well-defined and recognized. "Qibya" is a
    village in the West Bank, while "Mahis" is a town in Jordan. However, without
    specifying the context or the exact coordinates, the interpretation could vary
    slightly depending on how one defines "south" (e.g., directly south or generally
    south). This could lead to different interpretations of what "south" means in
    a geographical context. Thus, without precise definitions, the question admits
    more than one interpretation, leading to potential variations in the answer.
  - The question asks whether Mahis is located south of Qibya. To determine if this
    question is clear or ambiguous, we need to consider if there is a definitive answer

    names might refer to different kinds of locations (e.g., towns, landmarks). This
    lack of specificity can lead to multiple interpretations depending on which Mahis
    and Qibya are being referred to. Therefore, the question could lead to different
    answers based on these interpretations.
