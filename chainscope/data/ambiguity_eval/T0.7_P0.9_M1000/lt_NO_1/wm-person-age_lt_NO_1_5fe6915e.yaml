  - "The question is asking whether Abu Tahir Isfahani died at a younger age than\

  - The question asks whether Jean Flandrin died at a younger age than Richard Turstin.
    To determine the clarity of this question, we need to consider whether there is
    only one interpretation and a definitive answer. The question is clear in its
    structure, asking for a comparison between the ages at which two historical figures
    died. However, the ambiguity arises from the fact that the names "Jean Flandrin"
    and "Richard Turstin" are not widely recognized historical figures, and without
    additional context, it is difficult to ascertain who these individuals are and
    what their respective ages at death were. Additionally, without reliable sources
    confirming their identities and ages, any answer could be speculative. Therefore,
    the question can lead to different interpretations based on varying assumptions
    about who these individuals are.
  - The question asks whether Jean Flandrin died at a younger age than Richard Turstin.
    The question is specific in comparing the ages at death of two historical figures,
    Jean Flandrin and Richard Turstin. The interpretation hinges on the availability
    of historical data regarding the birth and death dates of these individuals. Assuming
    the necessary historical data is available, the question has only one interpretation
    and one correct answer based on factual information about their ages at death.
  - The question asks whether Jean Flandrin died younger than Richard Turstin. To
    classify the question as CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS, we need to determine if there is
    any uncertainty in the interpretation or in finding the answer. The question hinges
    on knowing the ages at which both individuals died. If both historical figures
    and their ages at death are well-documented and universally agreed upon, the question
    would be clear. However, if there is any uncertainty or lack of consensus about
    the ages or even the historical existence of either figure, the question becomes
    ambiguous. Without clear historical records or consensus, the question could lead
    to multiple interpretations or answers, making it ambiguous.
  - The question asks whether Jean Flandrin died at a younger age than Richard Turstin.
    To answer this, we would need specific information about the ages at which both

    which Jean Flandrin or Richard Turstin is being referred to. There could be multiple
    historical figures with these names, and without additional context, it is unclear
    which individuals the question is comparing. Therefore, the question admits more
    than one interpretation, depending on which historical figures are considered.

  - The question asks whether Anastasia of Sirmium died at a younger age compared
    to William II, Count of Chalon. To determine this, one would need specific information
    about the ages at which both historical figures died. The question itself is straightforward
    and seeks a factual comparison between two ages. There is no ambiguity in the
    phrasing or multiple interpretations of what is being asked. The question assumes
    the existence of historical records that can provide the ages at which these individuals
    died. Therefore, it admits one interpretation and one correct answer based on
    historical data.
  - The question asks whether Anastasia of Sirmium died younger than William II, Count
    of Chalon. The question is structured to compare the ages at death of two historical
    figures, which seems straightforward. However, the potential ambiguity arises
    if there is any uncertainty or lack of consensus about the exact dates of birth
    and death for either or both figures. Historical records from ancient times can

  - The question compares the ages at death of two historical figures, Anastasia of
    Sirmium and William II, Count of Chalon. To determine whether the question is
    clear or ambiguous, we need to consider whether there is any room for interpretation
    or multiple answers. Anastasia of Sirmium is a Christian martyr who died in the
    early 4th century, traditionally believed to have been executed at a young age.
    William II, Count of Chalon, lived during the 12th century, with historical records
    indicating he died at a specific age. The question seems to ask for a straightforward
    comparison of their ages at death, which can be answered with historical data.
    However, the potential ambiguity arises from the fact that the exact ages of these
    figures at the time of their deaths may not be precisely recorded or universally
    agreed upon, particularly in the case of ancient figures like Anastasia. Thus,
    there could be differing interpretations based on varying historical sources or
    scholarly opinions about their exact ages at death.
  - The question asks whether Anastasia of Sirmium died younger than William II, Count
    of Chalon. This is a straightforward comparison of ages at death between two historical
    figures. It does not admit multiple interpretations, as it requires specific factual
    information regarding the ages of the two individuals at the time of their deaths.
    Therefore, it has only one correct answer based on historical data.
  - This question is AMBIGUOUS because it involves comparing the ages at death of
    two historical figures, Anastasia of Sirmium and William II, Count of Chalon.
    The ambiguity arises due to the lack of clear historical records about their exact
    birth and death dates. Anastasia of Sirmium is a saint from the early Christian
    era, and historical records from that time are often incomplete or uncertain.
    William II, Count of Chalon, also has limited historical documentation regarding
    his lifespan. Without precise dates, the question can be interpreted in different
    ways, leading to multiple potential answers based on different historical sources
    or interpretations.
  - 'The question asks for a comparison of the ages at death of two historical figures:

  - This question is asking for a comparison between the ages at which two historical
    figures, Anastasia of Sirmium and William II, Count of Chalon, died. The question
    seems straightforward in seeking a factual answer based on historical records.
    However, the ambiguity arises because the historical records for Anastasia of
    Sirmium, a saint who lived in the early centuries AD, may not be precise or universally
    agreed upon regarding her birth and death dates. Similarly, there might be variations
    in historical records about William II, Count of Chalon. Therefore, while the
    question has a clear intent, the potential variability in historical data makes
    it ambiguous in terms of being able to provide a definitive answer.

  - 'The question asks for a comparison of the ages at which two historical figures
    died: Empress Zhang and Patriarch Michael II of Antioch. To determine if the question
    is clear or ambiguous, we need to consider whether there is any room for multiple
    interpretations. The question is straightforward as it requires a factual comparison
    of their ages at death. There is no ambiguity in the phrasing or the concept,
    as it simply asks which individual was younger at the time of their death. Therefore,
    the question can be answered definitively if the birth and death dates of both
    figures are known.'
  - The question asks whether Empress Zhang died younger than Patriarch Michael II
    of Antioch. For this question to be clear, the identities of both Empress Zhang
    and Patriarch Michael II of Antioch must be unambiguous, and their respective
    birth and death dates must be well-documented and agreed upon in historical records.
    However, the question does not specify which Empress Zhang it refers to, as there
    could be multiple historical figures with that title. Without additional context
    or specific time periods, it's unclear which Empress Zhang is being compared to
    Patriarch Michael II of Antioch. This lack of specificity leads to multiple possible
    interpretations, making it difficult to provide a definitive answer.

    existence of multiple historical figures with the titles "Empress Zhang" and "Patriarch
    Michael II of Antioch," as these titles could refer to different individuals from

    The question assumes that both individuals are well-defined historical figures

    context or specification of which Antonio Arcioni and William III de Cantilupe
    are being referred to, the question could have multiple interpretations depending
    on which historical figures are identified. Thus, the lack of specificity in identifying
    the exact individuals makes the question ambiguous.
  - The question asks whether Antonio Arcioni died at a younger age than William III
    de Cantilupe. For this question to be clear, both historical figures need to be
    well-documented with known birth and death dates. However, the question does not
    specify the exact individuals being referred to, as there might be multiple historical
    figures with the same or similar names. Additionally, without precise dates or
    more context about which Antonio Arcioni and William III de Cantilupe are being
    referred to, the question could be interpreted in various ways depending on which
    individuals one assumes. This leads to ambiguity in the interpretation of the
    question.
  - The question asks whether Antonio Arcioni died younger than William III de Cantilupe.
    To answer this, we need specific birth and death dates for both individuals to
    compare their ages at death. The question is clear in its intent to compare the
    ages at death of two specific historical figures. Assuming accurate historical
    data exists for these figures, the question does not admit multiple interpretations
    or answers. Therefore, it is a straightforward question about historical facts.
  - The question asks whether Antonio Arcioni died at a younger age than William III
    de Cantilupe. This requires specific information about the birth and death dates
    of both individuals. The question does not present multiple interpretations or
    require subjective analysis, as it is a straightforward comparison of ages at
    death. However, if the historical figures are not well-documented or there is
    conflicting information about their birth or death dates, this could complicate
    finding a precise answer. Despite this potential difficulty in obtaining the data,
    the question itself remains clear in what it is asking.
  - The question asks whether Antonio Arcioni died younger than William III de Cantilupe.
    To answer this, one would need to know the birth and death dates of both historical
    figures. However, the question itself is straightforward and does not present
    multiple interpretations. The answer depends solely on the historical data regarding
    the ages at which both individuals died.
  - This question is AMBIGUOUS because it involves comparing the ages at death of
    two historical figures, Antonio Arcioni and William III de Cantilupe. The ambiguity
    arises due to the potential lack of widely available or consistent historical
    records about these specific individuals, which can lead to different interpretations
    or answers. Without clear, verified historical data, the question cannot be definitively
    answered, making it open to multiple interpretations based on the sources available.
  - 'The question asks whether Antonio Arcioni died at a younger age than William
    III de Cantilupe. This question is clear in its intent as it seeks a direct comparison
    of the ages at death of two specific historical figures. The interpretation is
    straightforward: determine the age at death for each individual and compare the
    two. There is only one interpretation and one correct answer based on historical
    data, assuming such data is available and accurate for both individuals.'
  - The question asks whether Antonio Arcioni died younger than William III de Cantilupe.
    This requires specific historical information about the ages at death of both

    at death, which is a factual inquiry. However, without additional context or knowledge
    about these historical figures, it is difficult to determine if there is sufficient
    historical data to answer it definitively. Assuming the necessary historical data
    is available, the question itself is clear because it seeks a straightforward

    de Cantilupe. To answer this question accurately, we need specific birth and death
    dates for both historical figures. However, without this information provided
    in the question, it is not immediately clear. The question itself is specific,
    asking for a comparison of ages at death, which would generally be straightforward
    if the necessary historical data is available. Therefore, the question itself
    admits only one interpretation: comparing the ages at which these two individuals
    died. The potential ambiguity arises not from the question''s wording but from
    the availability and accuracy of historical records.'
  - The question asks whether Friedrich Gren died younger than William II de Cantilupe.
    This is a straightforward comparison of ages at death between two historical figures.
    The interpretation hinges on known historical data about the birth and death dates
    of both individuals. If these dates are accurately documented, the question admits
    only one correct answer, which is whether Gren's age at death was less than Cantilupe's.
    There is no ambiguity in the phrasing or potential for multiple interpretations
    of what is being asked.

    Without clear historical records, there could be multiple interpretations of their
    ages at death.

  - The question asks whether Elizabeth le Despenser died younger than Yury of Smolensk.
    To determine if the question is CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS, we need to consider the available
    historical data on the birth and death dates of these two figures. If there are
    definitive historical records that provide both their birth and death dates, the

    Elizabeth le Despenser was born in 1327 and died in 1389, making her 62 years
    old at the time of her death. Yury of Smolensk''s birth and death dates can vary
    depending on historical sources, but generally, he is known to have died in 1406.
    His birth date is less certain, but if we assume he was born around 1350 (a common
    estimate), he would have been about 56 years old at the time of his death.


    Given these estimates, Elizabeth le Despenser died at age 62, and Yury of Smolensk
    likely died younger, at about age 56. However, because Yury''s exact birth date
    is not definitively known and can vary, the question could be considered AMBIGUOUS
    due to the potential for different interpretations based on varying historical
    records.


    Thus, the question admits more than one interpretation because Yury of Smolensk''s
    birth year can vary, which affects the comparison of their ages at death.'
  - The question asks whether Elizabeth le Despenser died at a younger age than Yury
    of Smolensk. To answer this question, we need specific historical data about the

    of differing historical records or interpretations about their birth and death
    years, which might lead to different conclusions about their ages at death. If
    the historical data is consistent and widely agreed upon, the question is clear.
    Otherwise, it could be considered ambiguous due to potential discrepancies in

  - The question "Did Bartolomeo Raimondi die younger than Wilhelm von Saillon?" is
    asking for a comparison of the ages at death of two historical figures, Bartolomeo
    Raimondi and Wilhelm von Saillon. The question appears to be straightforward,
    as it seeks a factual comparison based on historical records regarding the ages
    at which these individuals died. If the birth and death dates of both figures
    are known, the question can be definitively answered with a "yes" or "no". However,
    the ambiguity arises from the potential lack of widely available or definitive
    historical records for these specific individuals, as they are not well-known
    figures. Without clear historical data, interpretations might differ based on
    varying sources or lack of information, leading to different answers. This potential
    for multiple interpretations based on the availability and reliability of historical
    records makes the question ambiguous.
  - The question asks whether Bartolomeo Raimondi died younger than Wilhelm von Saillon.
    To answer this question, one would need specific historical data regarding the
    ages at which both individuals died. The question assumes that both historical
    figures are well-documented and that their birth and death dates are known. However,
    if there is any lack of clarity or multiple figures with the same name, this could
    lead to different interpretations. In the absence of specific historical context
    or if these figures are not well-known or documented, the question becomes ambiguous.
    Without clear historical data or context provided within the question, it admits

  - The question asks whether Bartolomeo Raimondi died younger than Wilhelm von Saillon.
    To determine the clarity of this question, we need to establish if there is a
    single interpretation and a definitive answer. The question is straightforward
    in that it is comparing the ages at death of two historical figures. However,
    the ambiguity arises from the lack of widely recognized historical records for
    both individuals. If there is insufficient or conflicting historical data about
    the ages or even the existence of these figures, the question could be considered
    ambiguous. Without additional context or reliable historical records, it's unclear
    if a definitive answer can be provided.
  - This question is AMBIGUOUS because it requires specific historical knowledge about
    the ages at which Bartolomeo Raimondi and Wilhelm von Saillon died. However, the
    ambiguity arises from the fact that if either of these historical figures is not
    well-documented or if there is conflicting information about their dates of birth
    and death, the question could lead to different interpretations and answers. Without
    clear historical records, the question does not have a definitive answer.
  - The question asks if Bartolomeo Raimondi died younger than Wilhelm von Saillon.
    To answer this question, one would need specific historical data about the birth

  - The question asks whether Bartolomeo Raimondi died at a younger age than Wilhelm
    von Saillon. The clarity of this question depends on having specific birth and
    death dates for both individuals. However, the question is ambiguous because it
    assumes that the reader has access to this specific historical data, which may
    not be readily available or may vary depending on different historical sources.
    Furthermore, the question does not specify the context or timeframe, which could
    also affect interpretations if historical figures with similar names existed.
    Therefore, without clear and universally agreed-upon dates, the question can lead
    to different interpretations based on the information available.
  - The question asks whether Bartolomeo Raimondi died younger than Wilhelm von Saillon.
    To determine if the question is CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS, we need to consider if there
    are multiple interpretations or if there is a straightforward way to answer it.
    This requires historical data on the birth and death dates of both individuals.
    If such data is available and unambiguous, then the question would be CLEAR, as
    it asks for a direct comparison of ages at death. However, if there is a lack
    of information, conflicting historical records, or if the individuals are not
    well-documented historical figures, the question might become AMBIGUOUS because
    it can't be definitively answered without making assumptions or having more context.

    specific dates or additional context, it's unclear which historical figures are
    being referred to, as there may be multiple individuals with similar or identical

    (e.g., multiple people with similar names), or if historical records are insufficient
    or disputed, the question could be ambiguous. Given the specificity of the names,
    the question seems to rely on clear historical data rather than interpretations,
    provided these figures are uniquely identifiable and their life spans are recorded.
    Therefore, assuming no historical ambiguity in identifying these figures, the
    question is likely clear. However, without additional context about these specific

    \ recognized historical figures or may be transliterations or variations of names\
    \ that can refer to different people. Additionally, without specific dates of\
    \ birth and death for both individuals, it is impossible to definitively determine\
    \ who died younger. Therefore, the question admits multiple interpretations based\
    \ on potential identities of the individuals involved, leading to different possible\
    \ answers."
  - "The question asks whether \"Abraham Memmius\" died younger than \"\u9AD8\u5B63\
    \u5F0F.\" The ambiguity arises because \"Abraham Memmius\" and \"\u9AD8\u5B63\u5F0F\
    \" are not well-known historical figures, and there is insufficient context to\
    \ identify them unambiguously. Different interpretations of who these individuals\
    \ are could lead to different answers. Additionally, the use of different languages\
    \ in the names suggests a possible cross-cultural reference that is not clarified.\
    \ Without additional context or specific information about who these individuals\

  - "The question asks about the ages at death of two historical figures: Abraham\

  - The question asks if Heinrich von Besmedin died younger than Werner Schaler. However,
    it is ambiguous because there may not be well-known or widely documented historical
    figures by these names, leading to multiple interpretations. Without clear historical
    records or context for these individuals, it's uncertain how to determine their
    ages at death, if they existed at all. Additionally, the question assumes a specific
    historical context that is not provided, which could lead to different interpretations
    regarding which individuals are being referred to.
  - The question asks whether Heinrich von Besmedin died at a younger age than Werner
    Schaler. However, the question is ambiguous because it assumes that the reader
    knows the identities of these historical figures and their ages at death, which
    are not commonly known. Additionally, without context or additional information,
    it is unclear which Heinrich von Besmedin and Werner Schaler the question refers
    to, as there could be multiple individuals with these names throughout history.
    Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation and could lead to
    different answers depending on the historical figures being referenced.
  - The question asks about the ages at death of two historical figures, Heinrich
    von Besmedin and Werner Schaler. The question is ambiguous because it does not
    provide specific dates or contexts for these individuals, and multiple historical
    figures might share similar or identical names. Without additional information
    to identify exactly which Heinrich von Besmedin and Werner Schaler are being referenced,
    the question can lead to different interpretations and answers.
  - The question is asking whether Heinrich von Besmedin died at a younger age than
    Werner Schaler. This requires specific historical knowledge about the ages at
    which both individuals died. However, the question is ambiguous because there
    is no widely known historical figure named Heinrich von Besmedin or Werner Schaler,
    making it unclear who these individuals are. Without additional context or clarification
    on who these figures are, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer. Therefore,
    the question admits more than one interpretation, depending on the intended identity
    of the figures mentioned.
  - The question asks whether Heinrich von Besmedin died at a younger age than Werner
    Schaler. The ambiguity arises because the question does not provide enough context
    or information about who these historical figures are. Without additional data
    or clarification, such as birth and death dates, or more well-known identifiers,
    it is unclear how to interpret or answer the question. Additionally, if these
    are not well-documented figures, their historical records might not be easily
    accessible, leading to further ambiguity.
  - The question asks whether Heinrich von Besmedin died younger than Werner Schaler.
    However, the question is ambiguous because it does not specify who these historical
    figures are or provide any context or time frame for their lives. Without additional
    information, such as birth and death dates, or any historical records of these
    individuals, it is impossible to determine an answer. Additionally, the names
    may not correspond to well-documented historical figures, adding to the ambiguity.
  - The question asks whether Heinrich von Besmedin died at a younger age than Werner
    Schaler. This comparison requires specific historical data about the birth and
    death dates of both individuals. However, the question is ambiguous because it
    does not provide context or specify who these individuals are, and there is no
    widely recognized historical record of people with these exact names. Without
    further context or clarification, there are multiple possible interpretations,
    such as whether these are fictional characters, lesser-known historical figures,
    or individuals from a particular context or source. Therefore, the question could
    lead to different answers depending on the interpretation.
  - The question "Did Heinrich von Besmedin die younger than Werner Schaler?" is AMBIGUOUS.
    This is because there are no widely known historical figures named Heinrich von
    Besmedin or Werner Schaler, making it unclear whether these names refer to real
    people or fictional/lesser-known figures. Without additional context or information
    about who these individuals are, the question cannot be definitively answered.
    Furthermore, even if these individuals are real, without specific birth and death
    dates, determining who died younger could be open to interpretation or unknown.
  - The question asks whether Heinrich von Besmedin died at a younger age than Werner
    Schaler. The question is ambiguous because it relies on specific historical information
    about two individuals whose details may not be widely known or easily verifiable.
    Without clear, widely recognized historical data about their respective ages at
    death, and considering potential variations in historical records, interpretations
    of the question could vary. Additionally, the question does not specify which
    historical records or sources should be used to determine the ages, adding to
    the ambiguity.
  - 'The question asks whether Heinrich von Besmedin died at a younger age than Werner
    Schaler. To determine the answer, one would need specific information about the

    to answer the question definitively. If both figures' birth and death dates are
    well-documented, then the question is clear, as it seeks a straightforward comparison

  - The question asks whether Theodora Komnene Angelina died younger than Friedrich
    Gren. However, there are multiple ambiguities here. First, "Theodora Komnene Angelina"
    might refer to different historical figures, as the name components are common
    in Byzantine history. Without further specification, it's unclear which individual
    is meant. Similarly, "Friedrich Gren" could refer to different individuals with
    that name or similar names, particularly if it is a less well-documented historical
    figure. Additionally, the lack of specific birth and death dates in the question
    means that even if the correct individuals are identified, without those dates
    readily available, the question remains open to interpretation. These ambiguities
    mean that the question could lead to different answers based on different interpretations
    of the names involved.
  - The question asks whether Theodora Komnene Angelina died at a younger age than
    Friedrich Gren. To answer this, one would need the birth and death dates of both
    individuals. However, there could be ambiguity if historical records for these
    figures are incomplete or disputed. Additionally, "younger" could refer to chronological
    age or the actual year of death, which might not align depending on the birth
    years. Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation due to potential
    historical uncertainties and the interpretation of "younger."
  - The question asks whether Theodora Komnene Angelina died younger than Friedrich

  - 'The question is asking for a comparison of the ages at death between two historical

    because there are multiple historical figures known as Blanche de France, such
    as the daughter of King Louis IX and the daughter of King Charles IV, and their

    depending on historical context or transliteration variations. Without specifying
    which Blanche de France or which Princess Yangguo is being referred to, the question
    admits more than one interpretation, leading to different possible answers.'
  - The question asks whether Blanche de France died younger than Princess Yangguo.
    To answer this, one would need to know the birth and death dates of both individuals
    to compare their ages at death. However, there could be ambiguity in identifying
    these historical figures, as "Princess Yangguo" might refer to different individuals
    depending on the historical context or sources. Similarly, there might be multiple
    figures named "Blanche de France," leading to different interpretations of who
    exactly is being referenced. This ambiguity in identifying the correct historical
    figures could result in different answers.
  - The question asks whether Blanche de France died younger than Princess Yangguo.
    To determine the answer, we need clear information about the ages at which both
    historical figures died. However, the ambiguity arises because there have been
    several historical figures named Blanche de France, and Princess Yangguo might
    refer to different historical figures depending on the context or cultural interpretation.
    Without further context specifying which Blanche de France or Princess Yangguo
    is being referred to, the question admits more than one interpretation, leading
    to different answers based on the identities of the individuals in question.
  - 'The question asks for a comparison of the ages at death of two historical figures:

    its intent to compare their ages at death and does not suggest multiple interpretations.
    Therefore, assuming the historical records are available and accurate, there is
    only one correct answer to whether Blanche de France died younger than Princess
    Yangguo.'
  - The question asks if Blanche de France died younger than Princess Yangguo. However,
    the ambiguity arises from the fact that there may be multiple historical figures
    with these names, and without additional context specifying which Blanche de France
    or Princess Yangguo is being referred to, the question could lead to different
    interpretations. Furthermore, the information about the ages at which these figures
    died might not be widely known or easily accessible, adding to the potential for
    multiple answers based on different assumptions or sources.
  - The question asks whether Blanche de France died younger than Princess Yangguo.
    To determine the clarity, we need to consider the historical context. Blanche
    de France could refer to multiple historical figures, such as Blanche of France,
    daughter of Louis IX, or Blanche of France, daughter of Philip V. Without specifying
    which Blanche de France is being referred to, the question could lead to different
    interpretations. Additionally, Princess Yangguo is not a widely recognized historical
    figure, which adds further ambiguity regarding whom the question is referring
    to. The lack of specificity regarding the identities of the historical figures
    in question makes it ambiguous.
  - The question asks whether Blanche de France died younger than Princess Yangguo.
    To determine if the question is clear or ambiguous, we need to consider whether
    the identities of both historical figures are unambiguous and whether their birth
    and death dates are well-documented. Blanche de France could refer to several
    historical figures with that name, such as the daughter of Louis IX of France
    or the daughter of Charles IV of France. Similarly, "Princess Yangguo" may refer
    to different individuals, depending on the specific historical context or translation
    variations. Without specific clarification on which individuals are being compared,
    the question admits multiple interpretations regarding who these figures are,
    which could lead to different answers based on which Blanche de France and Princess
    Yangguo are being referenced.
  - The question asks whether Blanche de France died younger than Princess Yangguo.
    However, the question is ambiguous for several reasons. Firstly, "Blanche de France"
    could refer to more than one historical figure, as there have been several individuals
    with that name in history. Without specific dates or additional context, it's
    unclear which Blanche de France is being referred to. Secondly, "Princess Yangguo"
    is not a widely recognized historical figure, and there might be multiple interpretations
    or transliterations of this name, leading to confusion about which individual
    is being referenced. These factors result in multiple possible interpretations
    of the question, each potentially leading to different answers.
  - The question asks whether Blanche de France died younger than Princess Yangguo.
    However, the ambiguity arises because there have been multiple historical figures
    with the name Blanche de France, each living in different centuries. Additionally,
    Princess Yangguo is not a widely recognized historical figure, which adds to the
    ambiguity. Without specific dates or more information about which individuals
    are being referenced, the question admits more than one interpretation and could
    lead to different answers.
  - The question asks whether Blanche de France died younger than Princess Yangguo.
    This requires knowledge of the birth and death dates of both historical figures.
    However, the question is ambiguous because there are multiple individuals who

    figures with this name. Additionally, "Princess Yangguo" is not a widely recognized
    name, and could potentially refer to different figures depending on context or
    transliteration variations. Without specific details about which individuals are
    being referenced, the question could lead to different interpretations and answers.
