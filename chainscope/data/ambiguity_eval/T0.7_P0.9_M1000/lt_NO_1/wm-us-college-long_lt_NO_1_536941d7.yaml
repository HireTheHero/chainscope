  - The question asks if Gonzaga University is located west of Washington State University
    in Spokane, Washington. This question is specific and refers to the geographical
    locations of two institutions in relation to each other. Since both institutions
    are in Spokane, Washington, there is a clear way to determine if one is west of
    the other by looking at a map. There is only one interpretation of the question,
    which is to determine the relative west-east position of the two institutions
    within Spokane.
  - The question asks about the relative location of Gonzaga University and Washington
    State University in Spokane, Washington. However, there is an ambiguity here.
    While Washington State University has its main campus in Pullman, WA, it also
    has a branch campus in Spokane. The question specifically mentions "Washington
    State University Spokane, WA," which implies the Spokane campus. Therefore, the
    question is asking whether Gonzaga University is located west of the Washington
    State University Spokane campus. This interpretation leads to a clear answer,
    as both institutions are in Spokane, and their locations can be compared directly.
    Gonzaga University is indeed located to the west of the Washington State University
    Spokane campus.
  - The question is asking about the relative geographical locations of Gonzaga University
    and Washington State University Spokane. The question can be interpreted clearly
    as it is specifically asking whether Gonzaga University is located west of Washington
    State University Spokane. This is a straightforward geographical comparison question
    with only one correct answer based on the actual locations of the two universities.
    Gonzaga University and Washington State University Spokane are both located in
    Spokane, WA. Therefore, the question is clear in its intent and admits only one
    interpretation and answer.
  - The question asks whether Gonzaga University in Washington is located west of
    Washington State University in Spokane, Washington. Both universities are situated
    in Spokane, WA, which could lead to confusion if not considering the specific
    locations within the city. The question is seeking a geographic comparison within
    a specific city, which could lead to differing interpretations based on the granularity
    of the location details considered. However, since both universities are in the
    same city, generally, the location can be determined with precision if exact coordinates
    or addresses are used. Given the potential for different interpretations based
    on what level of precision is considered (city-wide vs. specific location), this
    question could be deemed ambiguous.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographical location of two specific
    universities in Washington state: Gonzaga University and Washington State University
    Spokane. It seems to be straightforward, as it asks for a comparison of their
    locations using the cardinal direction "west." However, there could be potential
    for ambiguity if one interprets "Washington State University Spokane" as referring
    to a broader area or multiple campuses, but typically "Washington State University
    Spokane" refers to a specific campus location. Given the context, the question
    seems to have a specific interpretation and a correct answer based on geographical
    data.'
  - The question asks whether Gonzaga University is located west of Washington State
    University in Spokane, WA. This question is geographically specific and asks for
    a relative location between two known institutions in Spokane, Washington. Given
    the specific nature of the question and the clear geographical context, there
    is only one correct interpretation and answer. Gonzaga University is located to
    the east of Washington State University Spokane. Therefore, the question is clear
    in its intent and interpretation.
  - "The question is asking for a geographical comparison between two specific locations:\
    \ Gonzaga University and Washington State University, both in Spokane, Washington.\
    \ The question could be interpreted in two ways: \n1. Is Gonzaga University located\
    \ to the west of Washington State University within the city of Spokane?\n2. Is\
    \ Gonzaga University located to the west of the main campus of Washington State\
    \ University, which is in Pullman, WA, and not Spokane?\n\nBecause the question\
    \ could be interpreted in different ways based on the campuses being referred\
    \ to, it admits more than one interpretation."
  - The question is asking for a geographical comparison between the locations of
    Gonzaga University and Washington State University Spokane, both of which are
    located in Washington state. The use of "west" provides a specific direction for
    comparison, and the question involves determining the relative positions of the
    two universities. Given that Gonzaga University is located in Spokane, WA, and
    Washington State University also has a campus in Spokane, WA, the question could
    be interpreted as asking about the specific campuses or possibly the main campus
    of Washington State University, which is in Pullman, WA. This introduces some
    ambiguity about which campuses are being compared. Thus, the question admits more
    than one interpretation, leading to different answers based on the interpretation.
  - The question asks if Gonzaga University in Washington is located west of Washington
    State University in Spokane, Washington. It specifies two institutions and their
    locations. However, there is potential ambiguity in the phrasing "Washington State
    University Spokane, WA," as it could refer to Washington State University (WSU)
    which is primarily based in Pullman, WA, or a branch located in Spokane, WA. If
    it's referring to the main campus in Pullman, then the question would be clear.
    If it's referring to a branch in Spokane, then the question would also be clear,
    as it would involve comparing locations within the same city. However, without
    explicit clarification, the question could be interpreted in two ways, leading
    to different answers depending on the location being compared.
  - The question is asking about the relative geographical location of two specific
    universities in Washington state. Gonzaga University and Washington State University
    Spokane are both located in Spokane, WA. The question could be interpreted in
    terms of their campuses or specific landmarks within the city. However, given
    that both universities are in the same city, the direction "west of" does not
    apply in a broader geographical sense, as it would not make sense to compare their
    locations as if they were in different cities or regions. Therefore, the question
    is ambiguous because the answer depends on specific internal locations within
    the city, which are not commonly referenced in such questions.

  - The question asks about the geographical location of Wilkes University in Mesa,
    AZ relative to Northcentral University, AZ. The ambiguity arises from the fact
    that Wilkes University does not have a campus in Mesa, AZ. It is primarily based
    in Pennsylvania. Therefore, the question could be interpreted as asking about
    a non-existent campus, leading to confusion. Additionally, without specifying
    a particular campus for Northcentral University, which could have multiple locations,
    the question could lead to different interpretations and answers depending on
    the assumed locations.
  - 'The question asks about the geographical location of Wilkes University in relation
    to Northcentral University, both presumably in Arizona. However, there is an inherent
    ambiguity because Wilkes University is primarily located in Pennsylvania, and
    there is no known campus in Mesa, AZ. This could lead to different interpretations:
    whether the question is asking about a hypothetical or incorrectly assumed campus
    of Wilkes University, or if it''s mistakenly referring to a different institution
    entirely. Additionally, Northcentral University is an online university headquartered
    in San Diego, California, which adds another layer of complexity to the interpretation.
    Thus, the question does not have a clear, singular interpretation, as it is based
    on potentially incorrect premises about the locations of the universities.'
  - The question asks whether Wilkes University, Mesa, AZ is located west of Northcentral
    University, AZ. However, there is ambiguity in the question because Wilkes University
    does not have a campus in Mesa, AZ; it is primarily located in Pennsylvania. Additionally,
    Northcentral University is an online institution headquartered in San Diego, CA,
    with its former headquarters in Prescott Valley, AZ. The question might be attempting
    to compare two institutions based on locations that do not align with their primary
    campuses or headquarters, leading to multiple interpretations and possible answers
    based on different assumptions about locations.
  - The question is asking whether Wilkes University, located in Mesa, AZ, is situated
    to the west of Northcentral University, which is also located in Arizona. The
    ambiguity arises because Wilkes University does not have a campus in Mesa, AZ.
    Wilkes University is based in Pennsylvania, and it previously offered some programs
    in Mesa, but as of recent updates, it does not have a physical presence there.
    Additionally, the question assumes that Northcentral University is in Arizona
    without specifying a particular location within the state. These factors introduce
    multiple interpretations, such as whether the question is asking about historical
    locations or current ones, leading to potential confusion in determining a clear
    and correct answer.
  - The question asks whether Wilkes University in Mesa, Arizona, is located west
    of Northcentral University in Arizona. While the locations of the universities
    are specified, the question is slightly ambiguous because it assumes that both
    universities are well-known or easily identifiable by their location. Additionally,
    there is an implicit assumption that both universities are within Arizona, which
    may not necessarily be the case for Wilkes University. Typically, Wilkes University
    is associated with Pennsylvania, and there might be a branch or extension in Mesa,
    AZ, but this is not universally known. The question could be interpreted differently
    if the reader is unaware of the existence of a Wilkes University campus in Mesa,
    AZ, or if there are multiple campuses of Northcentral University in Arizona. Therefore,

    \ for a specific geographical comparison between two entities. However, the ambiguity\
    \ arises from the mention of \"\xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes, NY,\" which\
    \ is not a widely recognized or specific location. This could lead to different\
    \ interpretations based on what one assumes or knows about the \xC9cole libre\
    \ des hautes \xE9tudes. Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation\
    \ due to the unclear reference to the second location."
  - "The question asks if the New York University Graduate School of Arts and Science\
    \ (NYU GSAS) is located west of \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes (ELHE) in\
    \ New York. The question is potentially ambiguous due to the following reasons:\
    \ \n1. The exact location of \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes in New York is\
    \ not well-documented or commonly known, which could lead to different interpretations\
    \ of where it is located.\n2. The question assumes that the \xC9cole libre des\
    \ hautes \xE9tudes has a fixed, well-known location in New York, which might not\
    \ be the case, as it may not have a prominent or singular campus location.\n3.\
    \ The phrasing might lead to confusion about whether it is asking for geographic\
    \ positioning or something else, as the name \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes\
    \ is associated with multiple institutions historically.\n\nDue to these ambiguities,\
    \ the question can lead to different answers based on interpretation or available\
    \ information about the location of \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes."
  - "The question is asking about the relative geographic location of two specific\
    \ institutions: New York University Graduate School of Arts and Science and \xC9\
    cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes, both in New York. The use of \"NY\" suggests\
    \ that both are in New York, but it doesn't specify if they are in the same city\
    \ or different parts of New York State. However, given the context and common\
    \ knowledge, it is reasonable to assume both are in New York City. Therefore,\
    \ the question is asking for a straightforward geographic comparison between the\
    \ two locations, which can be determined by checking a map. This suggests a single\
    \ interpretation and a single correct answer."
  - "The question asks about the relative location of two institutions, New York University\
    \ Graduate School of Arts and Science and \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes,\
    \ both presumably in New York. The question specifies the geographic aspect of\
    \ \"west,\" which implies a straightforward comparison based on longitudinal coordinates.\
    \ However, there is potential ambiguity in the phrasing \"\xC9cole libre des hautes\
    \ \xE9tudes, NY,\" as it is not a widely recognized or clearly defined institution\
    \ within New York, which could lead to different interpretations of what location\
    \ is being referenced. This makes the question AMBIGUOUS since the location of\
    \ \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes is not clearly established."
  - "The question is asking whether New York University Graduate School of Arts and\
    \ Science is located west of \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes in New York.\
    \ The question is geographically specific and asks for a location-based comparison\
    \ between two entities. The information needed to answer the question is factual\
    \ and can be determined by looking at a map or geographical data. However, there\
    \ is an ambiguity regarding the term \"\xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes, NY\"\
    \ because this institution may not be well-known or easily identifiable, and it\
    \ is unclear if it refers to a specific and recognized location in New York. This\
    \ could lead to different interpretations if the location of the \xC9cole libre\
    \ des hautes \xE9tudes is not clear or does not exist in a well-documented form.\
    \ Therefore, the question could lead to different answers based on the interpretation\
    \ of the location of the \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes."
  - "The question is asking about the relative location of two institutions in New\
    \ York. However, the name \"\xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes\" may refer to\
    \ historical or defunct institutions rather than a current, specific location.\
    \ The ambiguity arises because there might not be a widely recognized or singular\
    \ location for \"\xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes\" in New York, making it\
    \ difficult to definitively answer the question based on current geographical\
    \ references. Thus, the question admits more than one interpretation depending\
    \ on which location, if any, is being referred to."
  - "The question is asking whether New York University Graduate School of Arts and\
    \ Science is located west of \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes in New York.\
    \ The question is specific about the geographic location of two entities. However,\
    \ it assumes that both institutions have fixed, known locations in New York, which\
    \ should allow for a straightforward geographical comparison. Since the question\
    \ provides specific institutions and a clear directional query, it admits only\
    \ one interpretation and one correct answer based on their actual geographical\
    \ coordinates."
  - "The question asks whether the New York University Graduate School of Arts and\
    \ Science in New York is located west of \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes,\
    \ also in New York. The question is asking for a geographical comparison between\
    \ two specific locations. However, there is some ambiguity present. The term \"\
    \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes\" is not a well-known or commonly referenced\
    \ institution in New York, which may lead to confusion or misinterpretation of\
    \ what location is being referred to. Moreover, the specific names and their locations\
    \ might not be well-documented, making it difficult to provide a definitive answer\
    \ without further clarification or context about the exact locations being referenced.\
    \ Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation based on the understanding\
    \ and identification of the places involved."
