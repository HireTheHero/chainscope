  - The question asks about the relative location of Ledreborg in relation to Gothenburg
    Cathedral. However, the question is ambiguous because "Ledreborg" could refer
    to multiple places or entities, such as Ledreborg Castle in Denmark, and the term
    "east of" can depend on specific geographical contexts or interpretations. Without
    additional context specifying which Ledreborg or the geographical framework being
    used, the question admits more than one interpretation, which could lead to different
    answers.
  - The question asks whether Ledreborg is located east of Gothenburg Cathedral. To
    answer this, one would need geographical knowledge of the locations of Ledreborg
    and Gothenburg Cathedral. However, the question might be ambiguous due to the
    lack of context regarding the specific Ledreborg being referred to, as there could
    be multiple places or entities with similar names. Without clear context or specification,
    it's difficult to determine the exact interpretation of "Ledreborg" in the question,
    leading to potential multiple interpretations and answers.
  - The question asks whether Ledreborg is located east of Gothenburg Cathedral. This
    question could be considered ambiguous because it relies on the assumption that
    the locations of both Ledreborg and Gothenburg Cathedral are known and fixed.
    However, "Ledreborg" might refer to a specific place (such as Ledreborg Palace
    in Denmark) or potentially another location with a similar name. Additionally,
    the definition of "east" can vary slightly depending on the level of precision
    (e.g., a few degrees off could change the answer). Without specific context or
    additional information to clarify which "Ledreborg" is being referenced, the question
    could lead to different interpretations and answers.
  - 'The question asks about the relative location of Ledreborg in relation to Gothenburg
    Cathedral. To determine whether it is clear or ambiguous, we need to consider
    whether the geographic locations are precisely defined and if there is only one
    way to interpret the question. Ledreborg is a castle in Denmark, while Gothenburg
    Cathedral is in Sweden. Given their fixed locations, the question can be interpreted
    in only one way: whether Ledreborg is geographically east of Gothenburg Cathedral.
    There is no ambiguity in interpreting geographic east-west direction between two
    fixed points, so this question admits only one correct answer.'
  - The question asks about the relative location of Ledreborg in relation to Gothenburg
    Cathedral. However, it is ambiguous because it does not specify what is meant
    by "east" in terms of the scope (e.g., city, country, or continent level). Additionally,
    Ledreborg is a manor in Denmark, while Gothenburg Cathedral is in Sweden, which
    adds to the complexity of the question since the two locations are in different
    countries. Without further context, the question can be interpreted in multiple
    ways regarding the scale and context of "east."
  - 'The question asks whether Ledreborg is located east of Gothenburg Cathedral.
    This question is dependent on the geographical locations of two specific landmarks:
    Ledreborg and Gothenburg Cathedral. Assuming these landmarks are well-defined
    and their locations are known, there is only one correct answer regarding their
    relative positions on a map. Therefore, the question does not allow for multiple
    interpretations or answers.'
  - The question is asking about the geographical location of Ledreborg in relation
    to Gothenburg Cathedral. The question assumes a clear understanding of the geographical
    locations of both Ledreborg and Gothenburg Cathedral, which can be determined
    using maps or geographic data. Therefore, the question is specific and allows
    for a single interpretation and answer based on geographical facts.
  - The question asks whether Ledreborg is located east of Gothenburg Cathedral. This
    question could be considered ambiguous because the term "east" in geographical
    terms can vary depending on the specific points of reference used, the scale,
    and the interpretation of what constitutes as "east." Without precise coordinates
    or a defined map projection, there could be different interpretations of what
    "east" means in this context. Additionally, Ledreborg could refer to various locations
    or structures if not specified, adding to the ambiguity.
  - 'The question asks whether Ledreborg is located east of Gothenburg Cathedral.
    This question is clear in its intent, asking for a geographical relation between
    two specific locations. There is only one interpretation: determining the relative
    position of Ledreborg to Gothenburg Cathedral. Therefore, the question can be
    answered definitively based on geographical data.'
  - 'The question asks about the relative location of Ledreborg in relation to Gothenburg
    Cathedral. The interpretation of the question is straightforward: it requires
    determining the geographic position of Ledreborg concerning Gothenburg Cathedral.
    There is a clear geographic answer based on the specific locations of these two
    places, which can be found on a map. Therefore, the question admits only one interpretation
    and one correct answer.'

  - 'The question is asking about the geographical relationship between two specific
    locations: Wiebbe Hayes Stone Fort and Zhengzhou Ferris Wheel. The question is
    clear in its request for a directional relationship (east of) between these two
    points. However, without specific coordinates or more context, the question might
    seem ambiguous due to the lack of detailed geographical information. Despite this,
    the question itself is straightforward and seeks a single directional answer based
    on factual geographic data.'
  - The question asks whether Wiebbe Hayes Stone Fort is located east of Zhengzhou
    Ferris Wheel. It involves identifying the geographical locations of two specific
    landmarks and determining their relative positions. The question is clear in its
    intent, as it specifies two distinct locations and asks about their spatial relationship.
    There is only one correct answer based on their actual geographical positions.
  - The question asks whether Wiebbe Hayes Stone Fort is located east of Zhengzhou
    Ferris Wheel. This can be interpreted as a geographical question about the relative
    location of two specific landmarks. However, the question is ambiguous because
    it assumes the reader knows the exact locations of both the Wiebbe Hayes Stone
    Fort and the Zhengzhou Ferris Wheel, which could lead to multiple interpretations
    depending on the reference points used for "east." Without clear geographical
    coordinates or a map, different individuals might interpret "east" differently
    based on their understanding or the map they are referencing. Additionally, without
    further context, it's unclear whether the question refers to a specific map projection
    or context, which could affect the interpretation of "east." Therefore, the question
    admits more than one interpretation, which could lead to different answers.
  - The question asks about the relative geographical locations of Wiebbe Hayes Stone
    Fort and Zhengzhou Ferris Wheel. The interpretation hinges on understanding the
    locations of these two landmarks to determine whether one is east of the other.
    However, without specific geographical data in the question itself, the determination
    requires additional context or information. Thus, the question could lead to different
    answers depending on one's current knowledge or interpretation of "east" in this
    context (e.g., considering the possibility of longitudinal lines or local versus
    global positioning). Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation
    regarding the geographical understanding involved.
  - 'The question is asking about the geographical location of Wiebbe Hayes Stone
    Fort relative to Zhengzhou Ferris Wheel. This question is straightforward in that
    it is asking for a directional relationship between two specific landmarks. There
    is only one interpretation of the question: determining whether one location is
    to the east of the other. Thus, it admits one correct answer based on geographical
    data.'
  - The question asks whether Wiebbe Hayes Stone Fort is located east of Zhengzhou
    Ferris Wheel. It implies a geographical location comparison between two distinct
    landmarks. However, it does not specify the context or criteria for determining
    "east" (e.g., global map, specific map projection). The question assumes knowledge
    of both locations but does not provide additional context or constraints that
    might affect the interpretation of their positions relative to each other. While
    the question seems straightforward, the lack of context about the reference frame
    for "east" introduces ambiguity.
  - The question asks about the relative location of Wiebbe Hayes Stone Fort in relation
    to Zhengzhou Ferris Wheel. The question can be interpreted clearly as a request
    for geographical information. The interpretation of "east" in geographic terms
    is standard, meaning the direction toward the east. However, the question assumes
    familiarity with the locations of both Wiebbe Hayes Stone Fort and Zhengzhou Ferris
    Wheel. If these locations are well-defined and known, the question has a single
    interpretation and can have a definitive answer. Therefore, the question is asking
    for a straightforward comparison of the longitudinal positions of two specific
    landmarks.
  - The question is asking about the relative geographical location of Wiebbe Hayes
    Stone Fort and Zhengzhou Ferris Wheel. However, it is ambiguous because it does
    not specify the context or reference frame for "east." Without a map or additional
    context, "east" could be interpreted differently depending on the perspective
    or method used to determine direction. Additionally, the question does not provide
    sufficient information about the location of either structure to make a definitive
    determination. Thus, the question can lead to different interpretations regarding
    the reference point or method of determining the direction.
  - 'The question asks whether Wiebbe Hayes Stone Fort is located east of Zhengzhou
    Ferris Wheel. This is a straightforward geographical question that involves determining
    the relative position of two specific locations. The interpretation is clear:
    it is asking for a directional relationship between two fixed points on the globe.
    There is only one correct answer to this based on their actual locations on a
    map.'
  - The question asks whether the Wiebbe Hayes Stone Fort is located east of the Zhengzhou
    Ferris Wheel. This is a straightforward geographical question that seeks to establish
    the relative positions of two specific landmarks. There is only one correct geographical
    relationship between these two fixed locations, which can be determined using
    a map or reliable geographical information. Therefore, the question does not admit

  - 'The question asks whether the Asan Barrage is located east of Mustafa Castle.
    To classify this question as CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS, we need to consider the potential
    for multiple interpretations. The question is straightforward in asking for the
    relative geographic position of two specific landmarks: Asan Barrage and Mustafa
    Castle. The interpretation hinges solely on the geographical fact of their locations
    and whether one is east of the other. There is no apparent ambiguity in what is
    being asked, as there is only one way to interpret the spatial relationship between
    these two fixed points. However, without specific geographical knowledge or context
    (like knowing where these landmarks are), answering the question might be challenging,
    but this does not make the question itself ambiguous. It remains clear in what
    it is asking.'
  - The question asks about the relative location of Asan Barrage in relation to Mustafa
    Castle. The interpretation of "east of" is straightforward and typically refers
    to the cardinal direction. Therefore, the question admits one interpretation regarding
    the geographical positioning of the two locations. However, without additional
    context or specific geographical coordinates, it's not possible to determine the
    answer based solely on the question provided. Despite this, the question itself
    is clear in its intent.
  - The question asks whether the Asan Barrage is located east of Mustafa Castle.
    This requires specific geographic knowledge about the relative positions of these
    two landmarks. The question is clear and specific in its request for a directional
    relationship between two defined locations. Therefore, it admits only one interpretation
    and seeks a factual answer based on geographic data.
  - The question asks about the geographical location of the Asan Barrage in relation

    geographical query that can be answered with factual data about the locations
    of these two places. There is only one correct answer based on their positions
    on a map, so the question admits only one interpretation.
  - The question asks whether the Asan Barrage is located east of Mustafa Castle.
    While the question is straightforward, it requires specific geographical knowledge
    to answer accurately. The question itself does not present multiple interpretations;
    it is asking for a factual geographic relationship between two specific locations.
    Therefore, it admits only one interpretation and one correct answer based on geographical
    data.
  - The question asks about the relative location of the Asan Barrage in relation
    to Mustafa Castle. However, without additional context or a specific geographical
    reference, it is unclear which Asan Barrage or Mustafa Castle is being referred
    to, as there may be multiple locations with similar names. This lack of specificity
    in identifying the precise locations involved makes the question open to multiple
    interpretations, leading to potential different answers depending on the locations
    assumed.
  - 'The question "Is Asan Barrage located east of Mustafa Castle?" asks for a specific
    geographical relationship between two locations: Asan Barrage and Mustafa Castle.
    The clarity of the question hinges on the assumption that both locations are well-defined
    and their positions relative to each other can be precisely determined. If Asan
    Barrage and Mustafa Castle are well-known and their coordinates or locations are
    established, then the question is straightforward and should have a definitive
    answer. However, if there is any ambiguity in the names (e.g., multiple locations
    with similar names), or if their relative positions are not well-documented or
    commonly agreed upon, the question could be considered ambiguous. Without additional
    context, it''s unclear if the names refer to universally recognized locations
    or if there''s potential for confusion.'
  - The question asks about the geographical location of the Asan Barrage in relation
    to Mustafa Castle. It seems to seek a straightforward answer of whether the Asan
    Barrage is located to the east of Mustafa Castle. However, the ambiguity arises

  - The question asks if the "White House (plantation)" is located east of "AFI Silver."
    The reference to "White House (plantation)" is unclear because "White House" typically
    refers to the residence of the U.S. President in Washington, D.C., while "plantation"
    suggests a historical plantation site. Additionally, "AFI Silver" likely refers
    to the AFI Silver Theatre and Cultural Center in Silver Spring, Maryland. The
    combination of "White House (plantation)" introduces ambiguity as it is not a
    widely recognized or specific location. Without a clear understanding of what
    is meant by "White House (plantation)," the question can be interpreted in multiple
    ways, leading to different answers.
  - The question asks whether "White House (plantation)" is located east of "AFI Silver."
    The ambiguity arises because "White House" could refer to multiple locations or
    entities, such as the official residence of the U.S. President or a historical
    plantation, and it's unclear which one is meant here. Additionally, "AFI Silver"
    likely refers to the AFI Silver Theatre and Cultural Center in Silver Spring,
    Maryland. Without specific context or definitions for "White House (plantation),"
    the question is open to multiple interpretations regarding the location being
    referenced.
  - The question asks if "White House (plantation)" is located east of "AFI Silver."
    The term "White House (plantation)" is ambiguous because it could refer to multiple
    locations or historical sites, and it's unclear whether it refers to a plantation
    called "White House" or the White House itself. Additionally, "AFI Silver" likely
    refers to the AFI Silver Theatre and Cultural Center, but without clear context,
    the question could lead to different interpretations and answers depending on
    the intended meanings of "White House (plantation)" and "AFI Silver." Thus, the
    question admits more than one interpretation.
  - 'The question asks about the location of "White House (plantation)" in relation
    to "AFI Silver." The term "White House (plantation)" is ambiguous because it could

    States (commonly known as the White House), or it might refer to a specific plantation
    named "White House." Without additional context, it''s unclear what "White House
    (plantation)" specifically refers to. Additionally, "AFI Silver" likely refers
    to the AFI Silver Theatre and Cultural Center in Silver Spring, Maryland, but
    without more context on the intended locations, the question is open to multiple

    meaning of "White House (plantation)." Thus, the question is ambiguous.'
  - The question is asking about the location of "White House (plantation)" in relation
    to "AFI Silver." However, there is ambiguity in the question due to the use of
    "White House (plantation)." The term "White House" could refer to several different
    structures, including the famous residence of the U.S. President or potentially
    a historical plantation named "White House." Without additional context, it's
    unclear what specific location is being referenced, leading to multiple possible
    interpretations and answers. Additionally, the reference to "AFI Silver" likely
    pertains to a cinema or theater, but without knowing the specific "White House"
    being referenced, it is impossible to determine its location relative to AFI Silver.
  - The question asks whether "White House (plantation)" is located east of "AFI Silver."
    The ambiguity arises from the term "White House (plantation)," which could refer
    to multiple things. It might refer to a specific historical site, a place colloquially
    called a plantation, or something else entirely. Without further context, it's
    unclear which "White House" is being referred to, making it difficult to determine
    its location relative to AFI Silver. Additionally, the term "AFI Silver" likely
    refers to the AFI Silver Theatre and Cultural Center in Silver Spring, Maryland,
    but without explicit confirmation, there might be other interpretations of "AFI
    Silver" as well.
  - The question is AMBIGUOUS because "White House (plantation)" could refer to multiple
    locations or concepts. It is unclear whether the question is referring to a specific
    historical plantation called "White House" or metaphorically using "White House"
    to mean a type of plantation. Additionally, without a specific location or context
    for "White House (plantation)," determining its relative position to "AFI Silver"
    (a known theater in Silver Spring, Maryland) is not possible. Therefore, the question
    could be interpreted in several ways, leading to different answers.
  - The question asks whether the "White House (plantation)" is located east of "AFI
    Silver." However, it is ambiguous because "White House" is commonly associated
    with the presidential residence in Washington, D.C., but the parenthetical "(plantation)"
    suggests a different meaning. Additionally, "AFI Silver" likely refers to the
    AFI Silver Theatre and Cultural Center in Silver Spring, Maryland. The ambiguity
    lies in the unclear reference to "White House (plantation)," which could be interpreted
    in multiple ways. Without further context, the question could refer to any number
    of historical or local sites named "White House (plantation)," making it difficult
    to determine a single correct answer.
  - The question asks whether "White House (plantation)" is located east of "AFI Silver."
    The inclusion of "plantation" in parentheses after "White House" suggests that
    the question might be referring to a specific location or historical site, which
    could be different from the commonly known White House in Washington, D.C. This
    adds ambiguity because the reference to "White House (plantation)" is unclear
    and could refer to a different place entirely, leading to different answers depending
    on the interpretation. Without additional context or clarification on what "White
    House (plantation)" specifically refers to, the question admits more than one
    interpretation.
  - The question involves determining the location of "White House (plantation)" relative
    to "AFI Silver." The ambiguity arises because "White House (plantation)" could
    refer to multiple things. It could be interpreted as the White House in Washington
    D.C., or it might refer to a specific plantation named "White House" that is not
    widely recognized. Without additional context or clarification about what "White
    House (plantation)" specifically refers to, the question admits more than one
    interpretation, leading to different possible answers depending on the intended
    meaning.

  - The question asks about the relative location of Shasta Dam in relation to Glide
    Memorial Church. While it seems straightforward, the question is ambiguous because
    it involves the interpretation of geographic terms and the specific locations
    of the two landmarks. "East of" could refer to various scales (local, regional,
    or global) and without additional context about the reference points or the intended
    scale, the question could lead to different interpretations. Additionally, it
    assumes the reader knows the exact locations of both structures without providing
    coordinates or reference maps.
  - The question asks about the relative location of Shasta Dam and Glide Memorial
    Church. For someone with specific geographic knowledge, this question is clear
    because Shasta Dam and Glide Memorial Church are fixed locations on a map. Thus,
    the question only admits one interpretation and one correct answer based on their
    geographical coordinates.
  - The question asks whether Shasta Dam is located east of Glide Memorial Church.
    This question is AMBIGUOUS because it requires clarification on the specific geographic
    interpretation and reference points. "East" can depend on the specific reference
    points being used, such as city centers or specific geographic coordinates, and
    the question does not provide enough context to determine the exact locations
    of both points in relation to each other. Furthermore, the distance and scale
    of the locations (Shasta Dam and Glide Memorial Church) involve a broader geographic
    area that could lead to different interpretations based on different map projections
    or reference points used for "east."
  - The question "Is Shasta Dam located east of Glide Memorial Church?" is AMBIGUOUS
    because it depends on the relative positions of Shasta Dam and Glide Memorial
    Church, which are not specified in the question. Without additional context or
    specific geographic coordinates, the question could be interpreted differently
    based on various starting assumptions about the locations of the two landmarks.
    Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation, which could lead
    to different answers.
  - The question involves determining the relative location of Shasta Dam and Glide
    Memorial Church. While the question might seem straightforward, it is ambiguous
    because it requires specific knowledge of the geographical locations of both landmarks.
    Without a clear reference point or further context, "east" could be interpreted
    in various ways depending on the perspective or map orientation. Therefore, the
    question admits more than one interpretation regarding what "east" refers to.
    Additionally, without explicit geographical coordinates or a map, it's challenging
    to determine the correct answer with certainty.
  - The question asks about the relative location of Shasta Dam in relation to Glide
    Memorial Church. However, it does not specify which Glide Memorial Church it refers
    to, as there could be multiple churches with that name in different locations.
    Without clarification, the question could lead to different answers depending
    on which Glide Memorial Church is considered. Therefore, the question admits more
    than one interpretation.
  - 'The question is asking for a geographical relationship between two specific locations:
    Shasta Dam and Glide Memorial Church. The question can be interpreted clearly

    and potential answers depending on which Glide Memorial Church is considered.
  - The question asks if Shasta Dam is located east of Glide Memorial Church. While
    it might seem straightforward, the question is ambiguous because it depends on
    one's interpretation of "east" in terms of the specific geographical context and
    scale. The locations could be compared on a local, regional, or global scale,
    leading to different interpretations of what "east" means in this context. Additionally,
    without specifying the scale or map projection, the question could be interpreted
    in different ways.
  - 'The question asks about the geographical relationship between Shasta Dam and
    Glide Memorial Church, specifically whether Shasta Dam is located east of the
    church. The entities involved are specific and identifiable: Shasta Dam in California
    and Glide Memorial Church in San Francisco, California. There is only one correct
    interpretation and one factual answer to this question based on their geographical
    locations. Therefore, it does not admit multiple interpretations.'

    about relative location that can be answered with a map or geographical data.
    There is only one interpretation and one correct answer regarding the geographical
    positions of the two locations.
  - The question asks whether All Hallows' Church, Tottenham is located east of Tower
    of London tube station. This question can be interpreted in two ways. First, it
    could be asking about the geographical location of All Hallows' Church in relation
    to the Tower of London tube station. Second, it could be asking about the orientation
    of the church itself if it were somehow moved to the vicinity of the Tower of
    London. However, the most straightforward interpretation is the first one, where
    it asks about the geographical locations of these two places. Therefore, the question
    is not entirely clear because "located east of" could imply different aspects
    or interpretations depending on one's understanding of the context or orientation
    framework. Hence, this could lead to different answers based on interpretation.

    of Tower of London tube station. The question is clear in that it seeks a specific
    geographical relationship between two locations: All Hallows'' Church in Tottenham
    and the Tower of London tube station. However, the question contains an inherent
    geographical ambiguity because "All Hallows'' Church, Tottenham" could potentially
    refer to different churches with similar names, and the question does not specify
    which All Hallows'' Church it refers to. Additionally, the phrase "east of" requires
    a specific understanding of the relative geographical positioning. Without precise
    geographical coordinates or a map, the interpretation of "east of" can be subjective,
    and the lack of specificity about the exact church location adds to the ambiguity.'
  - "The question asks whether All Hallows' Church, Tottenham is located east of Tower\

    or a clear map reference, interpretations of "east" can vary slightly depending
    on the mapping projection used. Nevertheless, for most practical purposes, this
    is a straightforward geographical question that typically admits one correct answer
    based on standard maps.

    This question does not present multiple interpretations, as it involves a simple
    spatial relationship between two fixed locations.'
  - The question is asking about the geographical location of the Tianjin Modern City
    Office Tower in relation to the Great Wall of China. This seems to be a straightforward
    question about relative location. However, the question may be considered ambiguous
    because it doesn't specify which part of the Great Wall of China is being referred
    to, as the wall spans a significant distance across China. Depending on the specific
    section of the Great Wall being referenced, the answer could vary. Therefore,
    the question could admit more than one interpretation based on the section of
    the Great Wall considered.
  - The question is asking whether the Tianjin Modern City Office Tower is located
    east of the Great Wall of China. The Great Wall of China is a specific landmark,
    and its geographical orientation can be determined. Similarly, the location of
    the Tianjin Modern City Office Tower can be identified. The question is straightforward
    in its geographical inquiry, as it seeks to determine the relative position of

    involves checking the geographical coordinates or map locations of both landmarks
    to determine if the tower is east of the Great Wall.
  - The question asks whether the Tianjin Modern City Office Tower is located east
    of the Great Wall of China. This question is geographically specific and asks
    for a straightforward comparison of locations. The Great Wall of China has a well-documented
    geographical position, and Tianjin is a known city in China. Based on geographical
    knowledge, one can determine if Tianjin, and by extension the Modern City Office
    Tower, is east of the Great Wall. Therefore, the question is specific and admits
    only one correct interpretation and answer.
  - The question asks if the Tianjin Modern City Office Tower is located east of the
    Great Wall of China. The Great Wall of China spans a significant portion of northern
    China, and Tianjin is a major city located to the east of the wall. This question

    Tianjin Modern City Office Tower is geographically east of any part of the Great
    Wall of China. Therefore, this question has one correct answer based on geographic
    facts.
  - The question asks about the geographical location of the Tianjin Modern City Office
    Tower in relation to the Great Wall of China. The query is specific and seeks

    City Office Tower in relation to the Great Wall of China. The inquiry is specific
    in terms of the locations being referred to: the Tianjin Modern City Office Tower
    and the Great Wall of China. However, the phrase "east of Great Wall of China"
    could be interpreted in different ways due to the expansive length of the Great
    Wall, which stretches across northern China. The Great Wall does not have a single,
    clearly defined easternmost or westernmost point, which means that "east of" could
    vary based on which segment of the Wall is being considered. Additionally, the
    lack of a defined reference point on the Great Wall makes it ambiguous whether
    the question refers to the eastern terminus, a specific section, or the general
    orientation. Thus, this question admits more than one interpretation, which could
    lead to different answers.'
  - The question asks if the Tianjin Modern City Office Tower is located east of the
    Great Wall of China. The Great Wall of China spans a large geographical area with
    sections running through different parts of China. Since the Great Wall does not
    run in a perfectly straight line and covers a vast distance, different interpretations
    could arise depending on which specific part of the Great Wall is being considered
    as a reference point for "east." Additionally, without specific reference coordinates
    or parts of the Wall, the question could lead to multiple interpretations regarding
    the precise location of "east" in relation to the Wall.
  - 'The question asks about the location of the Tianjin Modern City Office Tower
    in relation to the Great Wall of China. The phrase "east of Great Wall of China"

    it involves a specific directional query that can be answered with geographical
    data. There is a definitive answer based on the actual locations of the two structures.
  - The question asks if the Merchandise Building is located east of One Yonge Street.
    This question assumes a specific geographical context, likely in Toronto, Canada,
    where both buildings are located. The question is straightforward in its geographic
    inquiry, and it can be answered by examining a map or geographic data to determine
    the relative positions of these two buildings. Therefore, the question admits
    only one interpretation and one correct answer based on the physical locations
    of the buildings.
  - The question asks if the Merchandise Building is located east of One Yonge Street.
    To determine if the question is clear or ambiguous, we need to consider the geographical
    context. The Merchandise Building and One Yonge Street are both located in Toronto,
    Canada, so the question is about their relative locations within the same city.
    The question specifies a clear spatial relationship (east of), and there is a
    definitive answer based on their geographical coordinates. Therefore, the question
    does not admit multiple interpretations, as it specifically asks about the direction
    of one building relative to another within a defined area.

  - The question asks about the relative location of Maison Alcan in relation to YUL
    Condos. For it to be clear, both locations need to be well-defined and their geographic
    positions known. However, the question does not specify the city or provide enough
    context to determine the exact locations of Maison Alcan and YUL Condos. Different
    cities or regions could have different interpretations of these names, leading
    to multiple interpretations and answers. Therefore, without additional context,
    the question is ambiguous.
  - The question asks about the relative location of Maison Alcan and YUL Condos.
    To determine if the question is clear or ambiguous, we need to consider if there
    could be multiple interpretations or answers. In this case, the question is straightforward
    as it asks for a specific geographical relationship between two fixed locations.
    There is only one correct interpretation and answer to whether one location is
    east of the other. Therefore, the question is clear.
  - The question asks about the relative location of Maison Alcan in relation to YUL
    Condos. The question is potentially ambiguous because it assumes that the reader
    knows the specific geographic location of both Maison Alcan and YUL Condos without
    providing additional context or reference points. Additionally, "east" is a relative
    term that could depend on the specific locations of the two buildings and the
    orientation considered. Without clear geographic coordinates or a map, this question
    could lead to different interpretations depending on one's knowledge of Montreal's
    geography.
  - The question asks about the relative location of Maison Alcan in relation to YUL
    Condos. However, without additional context or a specific reference map, the direction
    (east) can be interpreted differently depending on the specific location details,
    map orientation, or reference points used by the person asking the question. Additionally,
    the lack of specific city or region makes it unclear without additional context.
    Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation depending on available
    information and assumptions.
  - The question asks whether Maison Alcan is located east of YUL Condos. To classify
    this question as CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS, we need to consider if there is only one
    way to interpret the locations of these two structures. The question is straightforward
    in asking about the relative geographic positions of two specific places, assuming
    the reader knows their locations. However, if there is any lack of clarity about
    which YUL Condos or Maison Alcan is being referred to (for instance, if there
    are multiple structures with similar names), or if there are different ways to
    interpret "east" (e.g., true east vs. magnetic east), it could lead to ambiguity.
    Without additional context, such as the specific city or map references, the question
    could be interpreted in different ways depending on the available knowledge about
    these locations. Therefore, the question is AMBIGUOUS because it relies on external
    knowledge and assumptions that are not explicitly stated.
  - 'The question asks whether Maison Alcan is located east of YUL Condos. This question
    seems to admit only one interpretation: it seeks to determine the geographical
    relationship between two specific locations in terms of eastward direction. However,
    the ambiguity arises from the lack of context about the specific locations being
    referred to. "Maison Alcan" and "YUL Condos" may refer to multiple entities or
    locations with similar names in different parts of the world, leading to different
    answers depending on which specific locations are considered. Without additional
    context to clarify the exact locations being referenced, the question can lead
    to different interpretations and answers.'
  - The question asks if Maison Alcan is located east of YUL Condos. This question
    is clear in its request for a specific directional relationship between two fixed
    locations. However, it assumes that the reader knows the locations of both Maison
    Alcan and YUL Condos and what "east" means in this context (geographical direction).
    Given that the locations are specific and the direction is clear, the question
    only admits one interpretation regarding spatial orientation. The answer depends
    solely on the factual geographical positions of the two locations relative to
    each other.
  - 'The question asks about the geographical relationship between two specific locations:
    Maison Alcan and YUL Condos. To determine if the question is clear or ambiguous,
    we need to consider if there is a straightforward interpretation and answer. The
    question is asking for a directional relationship (east of), which generally requires
    precise geographical data. Assuming both locations are well-defined and their
    positions are known, the question admits only one interpretation regarding their
    relative positioning. Therefore, the question is clear as long as the locations
    are unambiguously defined and their positions can be confirmed on a map.'
  - The question asks whether Maison Alcan is located east of YUL Condos, which seems
    to refer to specific buildings in a geographic context. However, without a clear
    understanding of the exact locations and orientation of these buildings, the question
    could be interpreted differently depending on the reference point used for "east."
    The question assumes knowledge of the specific geographic locations of Maison
    Alcan and YUL Condos, and without precise coordinates or a map, this could lead
    to different interpretations of what constitutes "east" in this context.
  - The question asks whether Maison Alcan is located east of YUL Condos. This question
    can be interpreted in more than one way due to the lack of specific context or
    reference points. The locations of Maison Alcan and YUL Condos could be understood
    in different ways depending on the map or perspective used (e.g., a specific city
    map, a broader regional map, or even a global map). Additionally, without specifying
    which city or area these structures are located in, it could be difficult to determine
    the correct answer. The question lacks sufficient detail to be interpreted as
    having only one correct answer.

  - The question asks whether "Langer Eugen" is located east of "Under (restaurant)."
    The ambiguity arises from the lack of specific context or location details for
    both "Langer Eugen" and "Under (restaurant)." Without knowing the specific locations
    of both entities, the question could lead to different interpretations and answers
    depending on which "Under (restaurant)" is being considered, as there could be
    multiple restaurants named "Under" around the world. Therefore, this question
    admits more than one interpretation.
  - The question asks whether "Langer Eugen" is located east of "Under," which is
    described as a restaurant. The ambiguity arises because "Under" could refer to
    multiple locations, as there could be several restaurants with the name "Under"
    around the world. Without specifying which "Under" restaurant is being referred
    to, the question allows for multiple interpretations, leading to different possible
    answers depending on the location of the specific "Under" restaurant in question.
  - The question asks about the location of "Langer Eugen" in relation to "Under (restaurant)."
    However, there are multiple issues that make this question ambiguous. Firstly,
    "Under (restaurant)" could refer to any restaurant with the name "Under," and
    without additional context or a specific location, it is unclear which restaurant
    is being referred to. Secondly, "Langer Eugen" is a known building located in
    Bonn, Germany, but without knowing the location of "Under (restaurant)," it is
    impossible to determine the relative position between the two. These factors lead
    to more than one possible interpretation, making it difficult to provide a single
    correct answer.
  - The question asks whether "Langer Eugen" is located east of "Under (restaurant)."
    However, the question is ambiguous because it doesn't specify which "Under" restaurant
    is being referred to. There could be multiple restaurants named "Under" around
    the world, and without additional context or location details, it is impossible
    to determine the correct geographical relationship between "Langer Eugen" and
    "Under (restaurant)." Additionally, "Langer Eugen" refers to a specific building
    in Bonn, Germany, but the lack of specificity regarding the restaurant makes the
    question open to multiple interpretations.
  - The question asks whether Langer Eugen is located east of Under, which is a restaurant.
    However, there is ambiguity because the term "Under" may refer to different entities
    or locations, and without additional context, it's unclear which specific "Under"
    is being referenced. Furthermore, the question assumes a geographical relation
    without specifying the reference points or locations involved, making it open
    to multiple interpretations.
  - "The question is asking about the relative location of Langer Eugen in relation\

  - The question asks about the relative location of "Langer Eugen" and "Under (restaurant)."
    However, it is ambiguous because it does not specify which "Under" restaurant
    is being referred to. There are likely multiple restaurants with the name "Under"
    across the world, and without additional context or a specific location, it is
    impossible to determine the relative positions of these two places. Thus, the
    question admits more than one interpretation depending on which "Under" restaurant
    is considered, leading to different answers.
  - The question asks whether "Langer Eugen" is located east of "Under (restaurant)".
    However, the question is ambiguous because it assumes that the reader knows the
    locations of both "Langer Eugen" and "Under (restaurant)" without providing specific

  - The question asks about the geographical location of Inunaki Dam in relation to
    St Mary's Star of the Sea Cathedral in Darwin. To determine if the question is
    clear, we need to consider whether there is only one interpretation of the locations
    involved. Inunaki Dam is located in Japan, and St Mary's Star of the Sea Cathedral
    is located in Darwin, Australia. Since these are fixed locations, the question
    admits only one interpretation regarding their relative positions. The question
    is clear in asking whether one fixed location (Inunaki Dam) is east of another
    fixed location (St Mary's Star of the Sea Cathedral).
  - The question asks about the relative geographical positions of Inunaki Dam and
    St Mary's Star of the Sea Cathedral in Darwin. However, the question is ambiguous
    because it lacks clarity on which "Inunaki Dam" is being referred to, as there
    might be multiple structures with similar names, or it might be a fictional or
    incorrectly named location. Additionally, it is unclear if the question implies
    a specific context or map projection that could affect the interpretation of "east."
    Thus, the question admits more than one interpretation due to these uncertainties.
  - The question asks whether a specific location, Inunaki Dam, is situated east of
    another specific location, St Mary's Star of the Sea Cathedral in Darwin. This
    question can be interpreted in multiple ways because "east of" depends on the
    specific geographical reference points and the relative distance between the two
    locations. Additionally, the question could be interpreted differently depending
    on the scale (e.g., local, regional, global) and the exact coordinates considered.
    Without further information or a specific map reference, determining the precise
    relationship between these two locations could lead to different answers.
  - The question asks about the relative location of the Inunaki Dam in relation to
    St Mary's Star of the Sea Cathedral in Darwin. It seems to be a straightforward
    geographical question. However, there is ambiguity because "Inunaki Dam" is not
    a well-known or easily identifiable location, and there might be multiple places
    with similar names. Additionally, the question could be interpreted as asking
    about the direction on a map, or it might refer to a broader regional context.
    Without specific coordinates or further context, it's unclear how to answer definitively.
  - 'The question is asking about the geographical relationship between two specific
    locations: Inunaki Dam and St Mary''s Star of the Sea Cathedral in Darwin. However,
    the question is ambiguous because it assumes that Inunaki Dam is a recognized
    location, but there is no widely known Inunaki Dam. Furthermore, the question
    does not specify which direction "east" refers to, as it could be interpreted
    differently depending on the perspective or map orientation. Additionally, the
    context of "world structures" is vague, as it could refer to various types of
    structures or locations around the world, adding to the ambiguity.'
  - 'The question asks about the relative location of Inunaki Dam with respect to
    St Mary''s Star of the Sea Cathedral in Darwin. However, there is ambiguity here
    because Inunaki Dam is located in Japan, not Australia, which makes it geographically
    unrelated to the location of the cathedral in Darwin. This could suggest a misunderstanding
    or misinterpretation of locations. Therefore, the question could be interpreted
    in multiple ways: as a factual inquiry about locations or as a hypothetical or
    mistaken association between unrelated geographical entities.'
  - 'The question asks about the relative location of the Inunaki Dam in relation
    to St Mary''s Star of the Sea Cathedral in Darwin. It appears to be a straightforward
    question about geographic locations. However, there is an issue: Inunaki Dam is
    actually located in Japan, not in Australia, where Darwin is situated. The question
    seems to assume that both structures are in the same geographical context, which
    they are not. This could lead to confusion or misinterpretation about the intended
    meaning of "east of" when considering such distant locations. Thus, the question
    has an inherent ambiguity due to the geographical mismatch.'
  - The question asks whether the Inunaki Dam is located east of St Mary's Star of
    the Sea Cathedral in Darwin. This is a geographical question that seeks to determine
    the relative location of two specific landmarks. However, the question is ambiguous
    because "Inunaki Dam" is not a well-known or easily identifiable structure, and
    there is no widely recognized "Inunaki Dam" that can be definitively identified
    in relation to Darwin or any other specific location. Additionally, the question
    does not provide sufficient context or clarification to resolve which specific
    "Inunaki Dam" is being referred to, if it exists. Without clear identification
    of the landmarks, the question can lead to multiple interpretations and potential
    answers.
  - The question asks for the relative location of Inunaki Dam concerning St Mary's
    Star of the Sea Cathedral in Darwin. To answer this question, one would typically
    look up the geographic locations of both landmarks and determine their relative
    positions. The question is specific and focused on a geographical comparison,
    which generally admits one clear interpretation and answer. However, the question
    contains an inherent ambiguity due to the mention of "Inunaki Dam," which is not
    widely recognized or commonly associated with a specific, well-known location.
    Without a clear reference to a known location, multiple interpretations could
    arise regarding what "Inunaki Dam" refers to. This ambiguity in the identification
    of "Inunaki Dam" leads to potential multiple interpretations, which can result
    in different answers.
  - The question asks if Inunaki Dam is located east of St Mary's Star of the Sea
    Cathedral in Darwin. This question is ambiguous because it involves two locations
    that could be confused or misinterpreted. "Inunaki Dam" does not appear to be
    a well-known or verified location in relation to the city of Darwin, Australia.
    Furthermore, there could be multiple places named "St Mary's Star of the Sea Cathedral,"
    though it is known that one is located in Darwin. Without clear context or widely
    recognized geographical points, the question admits multiple interpretations or
    assumptions about locations, leading to different possible answers.

  - The question asks whether the Orangery Palace is located east of the General Walker
    Hotel. This question seems to be asking about the geographical relationship between
    two specific locations, which should have a clear and definitive answer based
    on their coordinates or relative positions on a map. However, without additional
    context or specific geographical data, there could be ambiguity regarding which
    "General Walker Hotel" is being referred to, as there could be multiple hotels
    with that name in different locations around the world. This ambiguity in the
    specific identity of the "General Walker Hotel" makes the question open to multiple
    interpretations and potential answers.
  - The question asks about the geographical location of Orangery Palace in relation
    to General Walker Hotel. It presupposes that both locations are known and that
    their positions can be clearly determined on a map or through specific geographical
    data. However, without additional context or information about the exact locations
    of these places, the question could be interpreted in multiple ways. The term
    "east" could refer to a specific geographical bearing or a more general direction.
    Additionally, the names "Orangery Palace" and "General Walker Hotel" could refer
    to multiple places with similar names in different parts of the world, leading
    to different interpretations and answers. Therefore, the question is ambiguous
    without further context.
  - The question "Is Orangery Palace located east of General Walker Hotel?" is asking
    about the geographical relationship between two specific locations. The question
    assumes the existence and fixed locations of both the Orangery Palace and the

    where these structures are located. Without specific geographic references or
    a well-known context, there could be multiple places with similar names, leading
    to different interpretations. For instance, if there are multiple Orangery Palaces
    or General Walker Hotels in different parts of the world, the answer could vary
    depending on which ones the question refers to. Therefore, the question can admit
    more than one interpretation based on the potential existence of multiple places
    with these names.
  - The question asks about the relative location of the Orangery Palace in relation
    to the General Walker Hotel. However, it lacks specific context such as the city
    or country where these structures are located. Without additional information,

    There is no ambiguity in the way the question is phrased; it doesn't allow for
    multiple interpretations. It only requires factual knowledge to determine the
    correct answer.
  - 'The question asks about the geographical relationship between two specific locations:
    Orangery Palace and General Walker Hotel. To classify the question, we need to
    determine if there is only one way to interpret the query. The main interpretation
    issue here involves the specific locations being referred to, as there could be
    multiple Orangery Palaces or General Walker Hotels worldwide. Without additional
    context or specific geographic markers, the question could be about any Orangery
    Palace and any General Walker Hotel globally, leading to multiple possible answers.
    Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation due to the potential
    for multiple locations fitting the names given.'
  - 'The question is asking for a specific geographical relationship between two locations:
    Orangery Palace and General Walker Hotel. However, without additional context
    or specific information about the locations of these two places, the question
    could be interpreted in multiple ways. For instance, the question assumes that
    the reader knows the exact locations of both the Orangery Palace and the General
    Walker Hotel, which may not be common knowledge. Furthermore, the names of these
    places are not unique, and there could be multiple locations with similar names
    in different parts of the world. Thus, without precise context or coordinates,
    there could be multiple interpretations of what is meant by "east of," depending
    on which Orangery Palace and General Walker Hotel are being referenced.'
  - The question asks about the relative location of the Orangery Palace in relation
    to the General Walker Hotel. The question is structured to seek a geographic or
    spatial relationship between two specific landmarks. However, the question is

    around the world. Without additional context to identify the specific locations
    being referred to, the question could have multiple interpretations, leading to
    different possible answers.
  - The question asks about the geographic location of the Orangery Palace in relation
    to the General Walker Hotel. The interpretation of "east of" as a geographic direction
    is straightforward. However, the question assumes specific knowledge about the
    locations of both the Orangery Palace and the General Walker Hotel. If the exact
    locations of these two places are known, the question would have a clear answer.
    However, the ambiguity arises because "General Walker Hotel" is not a well-known
    landmark, and there could be multiple hotels with this name in different locations.
    Without specifying which General Walker Hotel is being referred to, the question
    admits multiple interpretations, leading to different answers depending on which
    hotel is considered.
  - The question is asking about the relative location of Orangery Palace in relation

    not specify the city or region where both landmarks are located, it becomes ambiguous.
    Additionally, without knowing if there are multiple places with similar names,
    the question can lead to multiple interpretations.
