    is clear in its request for a population comparison between two specific zip codes.
    There is no ambiguity in the interpretation, as it seeks a factual comparison
    based on population data for these two locations.
  - 'The question compares the population of two specific zip codes: 38118 in Tennessee
    and 98908 in Washington. It is focused on a specific fact-based inquiry regarding
    the population sizes of these two zip codes. There is only one way to interpret
    this question, which is to determine which of the two zip codes has a greater
    population. Therefore, the question is clear in its intent and seeks a straightforward
    factual answer based on population data.'
  - The question asks whether the population of the area corresponding to the ZIP
    code 38118 in Tennessee is greater than that of 98908 in Washington. While the
    question seems straightforward, there is ambiguity in determining the populations
    associated with ZIP codes as they can change over time, and data sources might
    vary. Additionally, ZIP codes do not always align perfectly with city or county
    boundaries, which can further complicate population comparisons. However, assuming
    current and accurate data is available, the question can be interpreted as a direct
    comparison of populations. Despite potential data source variability, the question
    itself is clear in its intent to compare the populations of two specific ZIP code
    areas.
  - The question asks if one zip code (38118, TN) is more populous than another (98908,
    WA). At first glance, it seems straightforward, as it asks for a comparison of
    population sizes between two specific zip codes. However, there are a few ambiguities
    that could arise. Firstly, the question includes state abbreviations (TN and WA),
    which might suggest a comparison of entire areas within those states rather than
    the specific zip codes. Secondly, population data can change over time, and the
    question does not specify a particular time period for the population data being
    referenced. Additionally, population figures for zip codes can vary based on different
    data sources or interpretations of zip code boundaries. These factors introduce
    ambiguity into the question, as different interpretations could lead to different
    answers.
  - The question asks if the population of the area corresponding to the zip code
    38118 in Tennessee (TN) is greater than that of the zip code 98908 in Washington
    (WA). The question is relatively straightforward as it is asking for a comparison
    of population sizes between two specific zip codes. However, there is a potential
    ambiguity in the phrasing because zip codes do not inherently belong to a state
    (TN for 38118 and WA for 98908), but rather to specific areas that might span
    across state borders. Additionally, the question assumes that the zip codes are
    accurately associated with the mentioned states, which may not necessarily be
    the case. Moreover, the question does not specify the source or time frame for
    the population data, which could lead to different interpretations based on different
    datasets. Therefore, the question could be interpreted in multiple ways based
    on these assumptions.

    different answers. Therefore, while the question is clear in its intent, the ambiguity
    arises from the variability in data sources and time frames for population statistics.
  - The question asks whether the location with the zip code 12571 in New York is
    more populous than the location with the zip code 01516 in Massachusetts. The
    question is straightforward as it seeks a specific comparison between the populations
    of two defined areas. However, the ambiguity arises from the lack of a specific
    point in time for the population comparison. Population numbers can change over
    time, and without specifying a particular year or period, the question could be
    interpreted differently based on different population data sets. Therefore, the
    question could lead to different answers depending on the temporal context assumed.
