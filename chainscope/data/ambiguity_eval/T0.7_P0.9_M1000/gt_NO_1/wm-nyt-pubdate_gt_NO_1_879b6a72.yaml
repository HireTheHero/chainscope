  - The question involves determining the publication dates of two specific New York
    Times articles to compare which one was published later. The query is straightforward
    if the titles correspond to unique articles with clear publication dates. However,
    if there are multiple articles with similar titles or if the titles are not unique
    identifiers, the question could be interpreted in different ways, leading to ambiguity
    in determining the correct publication order. Without additional context or unique
    identifiers such as publication dates, the question is AMBIGUOUS.
  - 'The question asks about the publication dates of two specific New York Times
    articles: "At the Taliban Office, Waiting for Progress on Talks." and "Before
    Kerry Visit, Netanyahu Goes to West Bank." It is clear in its request for a comparison
    of publication dates between these two articles. There is only one interpretation
    of the question, which is to determine whether the first article was published
    after the second article. Given that publication dates are fixed and can be verified,
    the question has only one correct answer based on factual information.'
