  - 'The question asks for a geographic comparison between two specific locations
    in Manhattan: "AMSTERDAM RESIDENCE" and "WASHINGTON HOUSES BUILDING 6." The query
    is about whether one location is north of the other. This seems straightforward,
    as it involves a simple north-south comparison based on their positions on a map.
    However, the ambiguity arises from the exact identification of these places. "AMSTERDAM
    RESIDENCE" and "WASHINGTON HOUSES BUILDING 6" may refer to specific buildings
    or complexes, and without additional context or widely recognized landmarks, there
    could be multiple places with similar names. Therefore, the question could admit
    more than one interpretation if there are multiple locations with these names,
    leading to different answers depending on which specific places are being referred
    to.'

    is seeking a geographical relationship (whether one is located north of the other),
    which is a straightforward request for factual information about their relative
    positions. However, the question is ambiguous because it does not provide enough
    context or detail to identify these specific locations unambiguously. Without
    additional information, such as addresses or more commonly recognized names, the
    locations cannot be definitively identified, and therefore, the directionality
    question cannot be answered with certainty. This lack of clarity about the precise
    entities being referred to means the question could lead to different answers
    depending on assumptions about what these places are.'
  - 'The question asks about the relative location of two specific places in Manhattan,

    ambiguous because "ROOSEVELT" could refer to various places within Queens, such
    as Roosevelt Avenue or Roosevelt Island. The exact location within Queens affects
    whether it is north of the GENERAL ELECTRIC BUILDING in Manhattan. Without specific
    clarification on what "ROOSEVELT" refers to, the question admits more than one
    interpretation, leading to different possible answers.'
  - 'The question asks about the relative geographical location of two specific places
    in New York City: Roosevelt, Queens, and the General Electric Building in Manhattan.
    The interpretation of the question hinges on identifying these two locations accurately.
    "Roosevelt, Queens" could refer to Roosevelt Avenue, a major thoroughfare in Queens,
    or perhaps another location in Queens associated with the name Roosevelt. The
    General Electric Building in Manhattan is a well-defined location. Assuming Roosevelt
    Avenue is intended, one could determine its location relative to the General Electric
    Building. However, without more context or a specific reference to "Roosevelt,"
    the question could be interpreted in more than one way. Thus, the question admits
    multiple interpretations, which could lead to different answers depending on which
    location in Queens is considered "Roosevelt."'
  - The question asks about the relative location of "ROOSEVELT, Queens" and the "GENERAL
    ELECTRIC BUILDING, Manhattan." However, the term "ROOSEVELT, Queens" could refer
    to several places, such as Roosevelt Island (which is technically part of Manhattan
    but often associated with Queens due to its proximity), Roosevelt Avenue, or other
    locations named Roosevelt within Queens. This ambiguity in the term "ROOSEVELT,
    Queens" leads to multiple interpretations, each potentially resulting in different
    answers regarding the geographical relationship to the General Electric Building
    in Manhattan.

    multiple interpretations based on assumptions about the naming. Therefore, the
    question can be seen as ambiguous due to these potential discrepancies in interpretation.'
  - 'The question is asking about the relative location of two places in the Bronx,
    NYC. It specifies two entities: "CLAREMONT REHAB GROUP 4 BUILDING 5" and "CLAREMONT
    REHABS GROUP 4." The wording suggests that the question is about whether one specific
    building within a group is located to the north of the entire group. The issue
    is whether "CLAREMONT REHAB GROUP 4" refers to a single entity or multiple entities
    spread over a larger area. The presence of "BUILDING 5" also implies there might
    be multiple buildings, but it''s unclear if these buildings are tightly clustered
    or spread apart, which affects the interpretation of "north." This leads to ambiguity
    about whether the question is asking about the relation of a single building to
    a cluster or to a larger area, which could yield different answers depending on
    interpretation. Additionally, the slight variation in naming ("REHAB" vs. "REHABS")
    might suggest a typographical error or an actual difference in naming, adding
    to the ambiguity.'
  - The question asks about the relative location of "CLAREMONT REHAB GROUP 4 BUILDING
    5, Bronx" in relation to "CLAREMONT REHABS GROUP 4, Bronx" within New York City.
    The question could be interpreted in multiple ways due to the potential for typographical
    or naming inconsistencies ("REHAB" vs. "REHABS") and the lack of precise addresses
    or coordinates. This ambiguity in the names can lead to confusion about whether
    they refer to the same entity or different locations. Additionally, without specific
    geographical data or maps, determining the relative position ("north of") is not
    straightforward. Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation and
    could lead to different answers depending on the understanding of the entities
    in question.
  - The question asks whether "CLAREMONT REHAB GROUP 4 BUILDING 5, Bronx" is located
    north of "CLAREMONT REHABS GROUP 4, Bronx." The question could be considered ambiguous
    because it is unclear whether "CLAREMONT REHAB GROUP 4 BUILDING 5" is a part of
    "CLAREMONT REHABS GROUP 4" or a separate entity. Additionally, there might be
    multiple interpretations of what constitutes the location of "CLAREMONT REHABS
    GROUP 4" (e.g., the center of the group, its northernmost part, etc.), which could
    affect the determination of what is north. Without specific definitions or coordinates,
    the question could lead to different answers based on these interpretations.
  - The question is asking for a specific geographical relationship between two locations
    in the Bronx, NYC. However, the naming of the places ("CLAREMONT REHAB GROUP 4
    BUILDING 5" and "CLAREMONT REHABS GROUP 4") is very similar, which could lead
    to confusion if there are multiple facilities or buildings with similar names.
    The question could be interpreted in different ways if the naming conventions
    are not unique or if there are multiple buildings within the same group. Without
    precise information or context about these specific locations, the question can
    lead to different interpretations regarding which specific buildings or groups
    are being referred to.
  - 'The question is asking for the relative location of two places in the Bronx,
    NYC: "CLAREMONT REHAB GROUP 4 BUILDING 5" and "CLAREMONT REHABS GROUP 4." The
    question assumes that these two places are distinct and identifiable. However,
    there are a few potential ambiguities. Firstly, the slight difference in naming
    ("REHAB" vs. "REHABS") might lead to confusion about whether these refer to the
    same place or different ones. Secondly, without a precise address or map, it may
    be unclear whether "north of" is meant in a strictly geographical sense or if
    it includes other contextual considerations. These ambiguities could lead to different
    interpretations and answers based on available information or assumptions made
    about the names and locations.'
  - 'The question is asking about the relative location of two places in the Bronx,
    New York City: "CLAREMONT REHAB GROUP 4 BUILDING 5" and "CLAREMONT REHABS GROUP
    4". However, the phrasing of the question introduces ambiguity. Firstly, the names
    of the locations are very similar, differing only by the inclusion of "BUILDING
    5" and a slight difference in spelling ("REHAB" vs. "REHABS"), which could imply
    that they are part of the same complex or have related names. Secondly, without
    specific addresses or known geographical markers, determining the relative north-south
    position of these two locations is not straightforward. This could lead to different
    interpretations based on how one defines or understands the names of the locations
    and without additional context or mapping information, it could lead to different
    answers.'

  - The question asks whether a specific middle school in Brooklyn is located north
    of a playground in Queens. The question assumes that the locations of both the
    middle school and the playground are known and fixed, which should lead to a single,
    definitive answer based on geographic data. However, there is ambiguity in the
    question due to the possibility of multiple locations for "Riverdale Avenue Middle
    School" and "Springfield Playground" because neither name is unique to a single
    location in NYC. Therefore, without additional context or specific addresses,
    the question can be interpreted in multiple ways, leading to different answers.
  - The question asks whether "RIVERDALE AVENUE MIDDLE SCHOOL, Brooklyn" is located
    north of "SPRINGFIELD PLAYGROUND, Queens." However, the question is ambiguous
    because there is no universally recognized "RIVERDALE AVENUE MIDDLE SCHOOL" in
    Brooklyn; Riverdale is typically associated with a neighborhood in the Bronx.
    Additionally, without specific addresses, determining the relative north-south
    positioning between the two locations in different boroughs is unclear. Therefore,
    the question admits more than one interpretation due to the potential confusion
    about the locations mentioned.
  - 'The question asks about the relative location of two specific places: RIVERDALE
    AVENUE MIDDLE SCHOOL in Brooklyn and SPRINGFIELD PLAYGROUND in Queens. The question
    is asking if the former is located north of the latter. The interpretation relies

    Since there is a single factual answer based on geographic data, the question
    only admits one interpretation and one correct answer.'
  - 'The question involves determining the relative location of two specific places:
    Riverdale Avenue Middle School in Brooklyn and Springfield Playground in Queens.
    While the question seems straightforward, there is an issue. The term "Riverdale
    Avenue Middle School, Brooklyn" could be misleading, as Riverdale is a well-known
    neighborhood in the Bronx, not Brooklyn. This could lead to confusion about the
    actual location of the school. Furthermore, there might not be a widely recognized
    "Riverdale Avenue Middle School" in Brooklyn. The question assumes the existence
    and location of these places without confirming their addresses, leading to potential
    ambiguity in interpreting the question. Therefore, the question admits more than
    one interpretation due to these uncertainties.'
  - The question asks if "RIVERDALE AVENUE MIDDLE SCHOOL, Brooklyn" is located north
    of "SPRINGFIELD PLAYGROUND, Queens". The question is straightforward in its request
    for a geographic comparison between two specific locations. However, the potential
    ambiguity arises from the fact that "RIVERDALE AVENUE MIDDLE SCHOOL" could be
    confused with a similarly named institution in a different borough, like the Bronx,
    which is also part of NYC. Furthermore, without specific addresses, the exact
    locations of these places could be subject to different interpretations, especially
    if there are multiple places with similar names in NYC. This could lead to different
    answers based on which exact locations are being considered.
  - The question asks if a specific location, RIVERDALE AVENUE MIDDLE SCHOOL in Brooklyn,
    is located north of another specific location, SPRINGFIELD PLAYGROUND in Queens.
    The question is clear in its request for a geographical comparison between two
    distinct places. The use of the word "north" provides a specific direction for
    comparison, and the locations are clearly identified. There is no ambiguity in
    what is being asked, as it is a straightforward question about relative geographic
    positions.
  - The question asks whether a specific middle school in Brooklyn is located north

    a definitive answer based on geographical data.'
  - 'The question is asking about the geographical location of one place relative
    to another, specifically whether Riverdale Avenue Middle School in Brooklyn is
    located north of Springfield Playground in Queens. This question requires knowledge
    of the specific locations of these two places to determine their relative positions.
    However, there is a potential ambiguity: the question might be asking for a general
    directional relationship (north/south) without specifying the exact addresses
    or coordinates, which could vary slightly depending on how one interprets "north."
    Additionally, the question assumes that both places are well-known or easily identifiable,
    but if either of them is not clearly defined (e.g., there might be multiple places
    with similar names), the question becomes ambiguous. Without precise definitions

    HOUSES BUILDING 3" in relation to "CONEY ISLAND HOUSES" within Brooklyn, NYC.
    The question appears to be straightforward, aiming to determine whether one specific
    building is located north of the other. The question assumes that "CONEY ISLAND
    HOUSES" refers to a specific, singular location or area, and "BUILDING 3" is a
    specific building within that area. This interpretation leads to one clear question
    about the relative position of these two locations. There is no evident alternative
    interpretation presented in the question that would lead to multiple answers.
  - The question asks about the relative location of "CONEY ISLAND HOUSES BUILDING
    3" in relation to "CONEY ISLAND HOUSES" in Brooklyn, NYC. However, the term "CONEY
    ISLAND HOUSES" could refer to the entire housing complex or a specific building
    within the complex. Without specific knowledge of whether "CONEY ISLAND HOUSES"
    refers to a single building or the entire complex, the question could be interpreted
    in multiple ways. Furthermore, the question does not specify which point of "CONEY
    ISLAND HOUSES" is being referenced (e.g., the center, a specific building), making
    it difficult to determine a clear north-south relationship. Therefore, the question
    can admit multiple interpretations, which could lead to different answers.
  - The question asks if "CONEY ISLAND HOUSES BUILDING 3, Brooklyn" is located north
    of "CONEY ISLAND HOUSES, Brooklyn." The ambiguity arises because "CONEY ISLAND

    buildings, including Building 3. Therefore, without specific coordinates or a
    clear definition of what constitutes the northern boundary of "CONEY ISLAND HOUSES,"
    the question could be interpreted in multiple ways. The relative position of Building
    3 in relation to the entire complex or a specific point within the complex is
    not clearly defined, leading to different possible answers.
  - The question asks whether "CONEY ISLAND HOUSES BUILDING 3" in Brooklyn is located

    within it. Without a specific reference point within "CONEY ISLAND HOUSES," it
    is unclear how to determine the direction relative to "BUILDING 3." Therefore,

    answers depending on the reference point within the housing complex.
  - The question asks whether "CONEY ISLAND HOUSES BUILDING 3, Brooklyn" is located
    north of "CONEY ISLAND HOUSES, Brooklyn." The ambiguity arises because "CONEY
    ISLAND HOUSES, Brooklyn" could refer to the entire housing complex, which may
    include multiple buildings, including Building 3. Therefore, depending on the
    interpretation of what "CONEY ISLAND HOUSES, Brooklyn" specifically refers to,
    the question could lead to different answers. If the entire complex is considered,
    Building 3 might be part of it and not necessarily north of it. If "CONEY ISLAND
    HOUSES, Brooklyn" is interpreted as a different, specific part of the complex
    excluding Building 3, then the question could be clearer. However, without additional
    context, there is more than one interpretation possible.
  - The question asks about the relative location of "CONEY ISLAND HOUSES BUILDING
    3" in Brooklyn in relation to "CONEY ISLAND HOUSES" in Brooklyn. The question
    is clear in its request for a specific geographical comparison between two locations.
    The terms used are specific to certain buildings and areas within Brooklyn, so
    the interpretation hinges on the geographical data available. However, without
    precise geographical data or understanding of how these specific locations are
    defined or named, there could be uncertainty about their exact positions relative
    to each other. If the naming convention or the understanding of what constitutes
    each location is not consistent or clear, this could lead to multiple interpretations.
    Therefore, the question can be seen as having the potential for multiple interpretations
    based on the naming and definition of the locations involved.
  - The question is asking about the relative location of "CONEY ISLAND HOUSES BUILDING
    3" in relation to "CONEY ISLAND HOUSES" in Brooklyn, NYC. The potential ambiguity
    arises from the interpretation of "CONEY ISLAND HOUSES," which could refer to
    the entire housing complex or a specific building within the complex. If "CONEY
    ISLAND HOUSES" refers to the entire complex, then the question is clear as it
    seeks to determine if Building 3 is located north of the complex. However, if
    "CONEY ISLAND HOUSES" refers to a specific building, the interpretation might
    change based on the layout of the buildings, leading to different answers. Without
    a clear reference to what "CONEY ISLAND HOUSES" specifically denotes in this context,
    the question admits more than one interpretation.
  - The question asks about the relative location of "CONEY ISLAND HOUSES BUILDING
    3, Brooklyn" in relation to "CONEY ISLAND HOUSES, Brooklyn." The question is specific
    about the entities involved and the direction in question (north). However, the
    potential ambiguity arises from the fact that "CONEY ISLAND HOUSES" could refer
    to a complex with multiple buildings, and without a specific reference or map,
    one might not know the exact layout or numbering of the buildings. Therefore,
    the question could be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the exact geographical
    or numerical context that is not provided within the question itself.

    in different ways: it might be asking about a different Williamsburg-like place
    within Manhattan, or it might be a mistake regarding the actual location of Williamsburg.
    This ambiguity makes it difficult to provide a single correct answer.'
  - The question is asking about the relative location of two places within Manhattan,
    NYC. However, there is ambiguity in the question because Williamsburg is a neighborhood

    it admits more than one interpretation regarding the locations being compared,
    which could lead to different answers based on one's understanding or assumptions.
  - 'The question asks about the relative location of Williamsburg and Hillman Houses
    within Manhattan. However, there is ambiguity here because Williamsburg is a neighborhood

    and another understanding the geographical locations correctly. This leads to
    different interpretations and potentially different answers depending on whether
    the error is addressed or not.'
  - 'The question is ambiguous because it contains a factual inaccuracy regarding
    the location of Williamsburg. Williamsburg is a neighborhood in Brooklyn, not

    specify which part of the bridge it refers to. Furthermore, "CAMBRIDGE HOTEL"
    is not a well-known or easily identifiable landmark in Manhattan, leading to uncertainty
    about its precise location. Without clear definitions or standard locations for

    Therefore, it is ambiguous.'
  - The question is asking about the geographical location of "RFK BRIDGE PED AND
    BIKE, Bronx" in relation to "CAMBRIDGE HOTEL, Manhattan." However, there is ambiguity
    in the question due to the unclear reference to "RFK BRIDGE PED AND BIKE, Bronx."
    The RFK Bridge (Robert F. Kennedy Bridge), formerly known as the Triborough Bridge,
    connects Manhattan, the Bronx, and Queens. It is not clear what "PED AND BIKE"
    specifically refers to in the context of the bridge, as the RFK Bridge has multiple
    sections and approaches. Additionally, the exact location of "CAMBRIDGE HOTEL,
    Manhattan" is unspecified and could refer to different locations if there are
    multiple hotels with similar names or if the hotel is not well-known. These ambiguities
    lead to multiple interpretations of the question, making it difficult to determine
    a single correct answer.
  - "The question asks whether the RFK Bridge pedestrian and bike path in the Bronx\
    \ is located north of the Cambridge Hotel in Manhattan. The question is geographically\

    does not specify which part of the RFK Bridge, which spans multiple boroughs,
    is being referred to. Additionally, the phrase "PED AND BIKE" might imply a specific
    section of the bridge, but it is not clear which section is meant. The lack of
    specificity about the exact points on the bridge and the hotel leads to multiple
    interpretations regarding their relative positions. Thus, the question admits
    more than one interpretation, which could lead to different answers depending
    on the assumed locations.'
  - The question asks whether the RFK Bridge pedestrian and bike path, located in
    the Bronx, is north of the Cambridge Hotel in Manhattan. The RFK Bridge connects
    Manhattan, the Bronx, and Queens, and it has paths for pedestrians and cyclists.
    The Cambridge Hotel, however, is a specific location in Manhattan. The question
    involves geographical locations and directions, which could be interpreted in
    different ways depending on what specific part of the RFK Bridge is being referred
    to, as well as the exact location of the Cambridge Hotel in Manhattan. Without
    precise definitions of the starting and ending points on the bridge or exact addresses,
    the question admits multiple interpretations regarding the directionality and
    positioning of these places. This leads to potential ambiguity in determining
    the relative north-south positioning. Therefore, the question is ambiguous as
    it stands.
  - The question involves geographic locations and their relative positions. The RFK
    Bridge, also known as the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge, connects Manhattan, Queens,
    and the Bronx. The term "PED AND BIKE" suggests a pedestrian and bike path, but
    it's unclear if this is a specific section or a general reference to the bridge.
    The question also mentions "Bronx," which could imply the Bronx section of the
    bridge, but this is not explicitly stated. Additionally, the "CAMBRIDGE HOTEL,
    Manhattan" is not a widely recognized landmark, leading to ambiguity about its
    exact location. Without precise definitions of these locations, the question admits
    multiple interpretations regarding which specific points are being compared, leading
    to potentially different answers.
  - 'The question is asking about the geographical relationship between two locations

    seems to imply a comparison of latitude between these two points, which is a straightforward
    geographic inquiry. However, the mention of "RFK BRIDGE PED AND BIKE" could be
    interpreted as referring to a specific part of the bridge, leading to potential
    ambiguity regarding which exact location is being referenced on the bridge. Additionally,
    the phrase "north of CAMBRIDGE HOTEL, Manhattan" could be interpreted in different
    ways depending on whether "north" is considered in a strict geographical sense
    or in a more colloquial or directional sense. These factors introduce ambiguity
    into the question, as different interpretations could lead to different answers.'

  - The question is asking whether the "RFK BRIDGE PED AND BIKE, Bronx" is located
    north of the "CAMBRIDGE HOTEL, Manhattan." The ambiguity arises from the term
    "RFK BRIDGE PED AND BIKE, Bronx," which may not clearly refer to a specific location.
    The RFK Bridge (Robert F. Kennedy Bridge) connects Manhattan, Queens, and the
    Bronx, but "PED AND BIKE" suggests a pedestrian and bike path, which could be
    interpreted as any section along the bridge. Additionally, the specific location
    of "CAMBRIDGE HOTEL, Manhattan" is not clearly defined, as multiple places could
    potentially match that description. These uncertainties lead to different interpretations
    and possible answers regarding their relative locations.

    in Staten Island, NYC: ATLANTIS MARINA & YACHT CLUB and THE VILLAGE PRESCHOOL.
    The question seems to be straightforward, as it requires determining the relative
    north-south position of one location compared to the other, which can be answered
    with map data. However, the interpretation can vary based on the specific geographic
    points used to represent each location (e.g., main entrance, geographic center),

    based on standard map readings.'
  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographic positions of two specific
    locations in Staten Island, NYC: ATLANTIS MARINA & YACHT CLUB and THE VILLAGE
    PRESCHOOL. The question is straightforward in its requirement to determine whether
    one location is north of the other. However, the ambiguity arises from the need
    for precise and accurate location data for both places, which is not provided
    in the question itself. This can lead to different answers depending on the specific
    addresses or geographic data used to determine their locations. Additionally,
    if the locations are not well-known or are ambiguous themselves (e.g., if there
    are multiple places with similar names), it could further complicate the interpretation.'
