  - The question asks whether Monica of Hippo died later than Magnus Maximus. To determine
    this, we need to know the death dates of both individuals. Monica of Hippo is
    known to have died in 387 AD, while Magnus Maximus died in 388 AD. Therefore,
    the question can be answered with a clear "no," as Monica of Hippo died before
    Magnus Maximus. The question is specific and does not allow for multiple interpretations
    or answers.
  - The question "Did Monica of Hippo die later than Magnus Maximus?" can be classified
    as CLEAR. It is asking for a comparison of the death dates of two historical figures,
    Monica of Hippo and Magnus Maximus. The question is specific in its request for
    a chronological comparison, which implies a factual answer based on historical
    records. There is no ambiguity in what is being asked, as it does not require
    interpretation beyond identifying and comparing the death dates of these individuals.
  - The question asks whether Monica of Hippo died later than Magnus Maximus. To answer
    this question, one needs specific historical dates for the deaths of both individuals.
    Monica of Hippo is a well-known historical figure, recognized as the mother of
    Saint Augustine, and she died in 387 AD. Magnus Maximus was a Roman Emperor who
    died in 388 AD. Given these dates, the question has a clear and singular interpretation,
    as it is asking for a factual comparison of death dates between two specific historical
    figures. There is no ambiguity in the question's phrasing or the information required
    to answer it.
  - 'The question asks whether Monica of Hippo died later than Magnus Maximus. This
    question is based on historical dates and can be interpreted in only one way:
    comparing the death dates of two historical figures. Monica of Hippo died in 387
    AD, while Magnus Maximus died in 388 AD. Therefore, the question has one interpretation
    and one correct answer.'
  - 'The question asks whether Monica of Hippo died later than Magnus Maximus. This
    is a straightforward comparison between the death dates of two historical figures.
    Assuming accurate historical records are available for both individuals, the question
    admits only one interpretation: comparing their death dates to determine who died
    first. There is no ambiguity in what is being asked; it simply requires factual
    historical data to answer.'
  - The question asks whether Monica of Hippo died later than Magnus Maximus. The
    question is specific and factual, seeking to compare the dates of death of two
    historical figures. Monica of Hippo died in 387 AD, and Magnus Maximus died in
    388 AD. Therefore, Monica of Hippo died before Magnus Maximus. The question has
    a single interpretation and a definitive answer based on historical records.
  - The question asks whether Monica of Hippo died later than Magnus Maximus. This
    is a straightforward historical inquiry about the chronological order of the deaths
    of two specific individuals. Monica of Hippo is known to have died in 387 AD,
    and Magnus Maximus was executed in 388 AD. Since these dates are well-documented,
    the question has a single interpretation and one correct answer.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative death dates of two historical figures:
    Monica of Hippo and Magnus Maximus. This question is specific and factual, as
    it seeks to compare the death dates of two individuals, which should have a definitive
    answer based on historical records. Monica of Hippo died in 387 AD, and Magnus
    Maximus died in 388 AD, so there is a clear answer to the question.'
  - The question asks whether Monica of Hippo died later than Magnus Maximus. Both
    Monica of Hippo and Magnus Maximus are historical figures with specific death
    dates, which means that there is a factual answer to this question based on historical
    records. Monica of Hippo died in 387 AD, and Magnus Maximus died in 388 AD. Thus,
    the question is asking for a direct comparison of these dates, which admits only
    one interpretation and one correct answer.
  - The question asks whether Monica of Hippo died later than Magnus Maximus, which
    seems straightforward at first. However, the ambiguity arises from the fact that
    the historical records for both figures are not entirely definitive regarding
    their exact death dates. Monica of Hippo, the mother of Saint Augustine, is believed
    to have died around 387 AD, whereas Magnus Maximus, a Roman usurper, was executed
    in 388 AD. While the years are close, the lack of precise dates for their deaths
    means that depending on the sources or interpretations, one could argue either
    way. Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation due to the potential
    variation in historical accounts.

  - The question asks whether Theodore Abu-Qurrah died later than Arno of Salzburg.
    This question is comparing the death dates of two historical figures. Since historical
    records typically have specific dates for such events, there is generally only
    one correct answer based on historical data. Therefore, the question does not
    admit multiple interpretations, assuming the historical records are clear and
    undisputed.
  - 'The question asks whether Theodore Abu-Qurrah died later than Arno of Salzburg.
    The question seems to have a straightforward interpretation: it is inquiring about
    the chronological order of the deaths of two historical figures. However, the
    question could be considered ambiguous if there is uncertainty or lack of consensus
    about the exact dates of death for either or both individuals. Historical records
    may be imprecise, leading to multiple interpretations of the question depending
    on which sources or interpretations of historical records are used. Without clear
    and universally accepted dates of death for both individuals, the question could
    lead to different answers.'
  - 'The question asks whether Theodore Abu-Qurrah died later than Arno of Salzburg.
    To determine if the question is clear or ambiguous, we need to consider if there
    is a single interpretation of the question or if it can be understood in multiple
    ways. The question provides specific names of historical figures and a comparison
    of their death dates. Since death dates are factual and can be looked up, the
    question admits only one interpretation: comparing the death dates of the two
    individuals. Therefore, the question is specific and has one correct answer based
    on historical records.'
  - 'The question is asking for a comparison of the death dates of two historical
    figures: Theodore Abu-Qurrah and Arno of Salzburg. The question is straightforward
    and seeks a factual answer based on historical records, which typically provide
    specific dates or estimated time periods for the deaths of these individuals.
    Since there is no indication of multiple interpretations or ambiguities regarding
    the identities of the figures or the nature of the comparison, the question is
    clear.'
  - 'The question involves comparing the death dates of two historical figures: Theodore
    Abu-Qurrah and Arno of Salzburg. To determine if the question is clear or ambiguous,

    died later than Arno of Salzburg, which is a straightforward comparison of dates.
    Historical records provide specific death dates for both individuals, assuming
    accurate historical data is available. Thus, the question has one interpretation

    is no ambiguity in the phrasing that would lead to multiple interpretations; it
    requires a factual check of historical records to find the answer.'
  - The question asks whether Theodore Abu-Qurrah died later than Arno of Salzburg.
    This question can be interpreted in a straightforward manner as a request for
    a comparison of the death dates of two historical figures. However, it could also
    be considered ambiguous if the death dates of either figure are not well-documented
    or if there are disputes or variations in historical records regarding their death
    dates. Without clear, consistent historical records, the question could lead to
    different interpretations or answers.
  - The question asks whether Theodore Abu-Qurrah died later than Arno of Salzburg.
    The question is specific in its inquiry about the relative timing of their deaths,
    referring to two historical figures. However, the question could be interpreted
    in different ways if the dates of death for either figure are not well-documented
    or if there are conflicting historical records. Without clear and undisputed dates
    of death for both figures, the question may admit multiple interpretations regarding
    their timelines. Additionally, the phrasing "later than" requires precise chronological
    information to provide a definitive answer, which might not be straightforward
    if historical records are unclear or debated.
  - The question asks whether Theodore Abu-Qurrah died later than Arno of Salzburg.
    To answer this, one would need to know the specific death dates of both historical
    figures. The question is straightforward and does not admit multiple interpretations
    regarding what is being asked. There is only one correct answer based on historical
    records of their death dates. Therefore, the question is clear in its intent and
    scope.

  - The question asks whether William Marshal died later than Agnes of Landsberg.
    This is a straightforward historical query comparing the death dates of two specific
    individuals. William Marshal, a well-documented historical figure, died on May
    14, 1219. Agnes of Landsberg, less widely known, died on January 25, 1266. The
    question is clear in its intent and scope, as it directly compares the death dates
    of two people and does not imply any alternative interpretations or require additional
    context to answer.

    both figures are known, the question can be answered definitively. Therefore,
    the question admits only one interpretation and one correct answer based on historical
    data.
  - The question asks whether Zichan died later than Anaxandridas II. This is a comparison
    between the death dates of two historical figures. The question is clear in its
    request for a chronological comparison, assuming the dates of death for both individuals
    are known. However, the ambiguity arises if there is uncertainty or lack of consensus
    about the exact dates of death for these figures, which could lead to different
    interpretations or answers. Therefore, without clear and universally accepted
    death dates, the question could be seen as ambiguous.
  - 'The question is asking for a comparison of the death dates of two historical
    figures: Zichan and Anaxandridas II. It requires knowledge of the specific death
    dates of both individuals to determine which one died later. However, without
    additional context or historical records readily available in the question, it
    can be unclear who these figures are and whether there is consensus on their death

    this question, we need to consider if there is a single, factual answer based
    on historical records. The question is asking for a comparison of the death dates
    of two specific historical figures. If historical records provide specific death
    dates for both individuals, then the question would have a clear answer. However,
    if the death dates of one or both figures are uncertain or debated among historians,
    the question could be considered ambiguous. In this case, the death date of Anaxandridas
    II, a king of Sparta, is generally known, but Zichan, a Chinese statesman, might
    not have a precisely documented death date. This could lead to different interpretations
    or uncertainty in the answer, making the question potentially ambiguous.

  - The question asks whether Arion died later than Guan Zhong, comparing the death
    dates of two historical figures. Arion, a legendary Greek poet and musician, and
    Guan Zhong, a Chinese chancellor and reformer, lived in different cultures and
    eras. However, historical records are not precise regarding the exact death dates
    of these figures. The ambiguity arises from the lack of precise historical data,
    making it difficult to determine an exact timeline for their deaths. Additionally,
    due to the legendary status of Arion, there may be differing interpretations of
    his life and death timeline.
  - The question asks whether Arion died later than Guan Zhong. This question is ambiguous
    because it involves comparing the death dates of two historical figures, Arion
    and Guan Zhong, whose exact dates of death may not be precisely known or could
    be subject to historical interpretation and debate. Additionally, the historical
    records about Arion, a legendary figure, may not be as concrete as those for Guan
    Zhong, who was a more documented historical figure. Therefore, the question can
    admit different interpretations depending on the sources or historical perspectives
    considered.
  - The question asks whether Arion died later than Guan Zhong. This question is AMBIGUOUS
    because it involves historical figures from different cultures and time periods,
    and there may not be universally accepted dates for their deaths. Arion, a legendary
    Greek poet and musician, has a life that is more mythological than historical,
    with little concrete evidence about his death. Guan Zhong was a Chinese philosopher
    and politician who lived during the Spring and Autumn period, with more concrete
    historical records. The lack of definitive historical data for Arion, combined
    with potential variations in historical interpretations, leads to multiple possible
    answers.
  - The question "Did Arion die later than Guan Zhong?" is ambiguous because it requires
    knowledge of two historical figures from different cultures and time periods,
    which may not be commonly known or straightforward. Arion is a legendary Greek
    poet and musician, while Guan Zhong was a Chinese politician and philosopher.
    The lack of specific dates or context makes it unclear whether the question refers
    to mythical or historical records. Additionally, interpretations of their deaths
    could vary based on different historical sources or legends, leading to different
    answers.
  - The question asks whether Arion died later than Guan Zhong, comparing the times
    of death of two historical figures. Arion is a legendary Greek poet from around
    the 7th century BCE, and Guan Zhong was a Chinese chancellor who lived during
    the Spring and Autumn period (approximately 720-645 BCE). The question is asking
    for a straightforward chronological comparison based on historical records. Despite
    the potential for uncertainty in exact historical dates, the question itself is
    specific in its request and does not admit multiple interpretations; it seeks
    a single chronological comparison.
  - The question asks whether Arion died later than Guan Zhong. To answer this, we
    need specific historical information about the death dates of these figures. Arion
    is a legendary figure from ancient Greece, often associated with a specific myth,
    and his historical existence and death date are not clearly documented. Guan Zhong
    was a Chinese chancellor who lived during the Spring and Autumn period, with a
    more established historical timeline. The ambiguity arises from the lack of definitive
    historical records for Arion, making it difficult to compare the death dates accurately.
    Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation due to the uncertainty
    surrounding Arion's historical timeline.
  - The question asks whether Arion died later than Guan Zhong, comparing the lifespans

    reformer who lived during the Spring and Autumn period (died in 645 BC). The question
    is clear in asking for a chronological comparison of their deaths. However, given
    that Arion's existence and exact dates are not definitively established, the question
    could be considered ambiguous due to the lack of precise historical records. Despite
    this, the interpretation of the question itself is straightforward, aiming to

    degli Uberti was an Italian Benedictine abbot and cardinal in the 11th century.
    Assuming historical records provide clear dates or at least a clear timeline of

    Ying Chang and Gu Shao. To classify it as CLEAR, it should have a specific and
    unambiguous interpretation with one correct answer. However, without additional
    context or information about who these figures are, there could be multiple individuals
    with these names across different periods or locations, leading to different interpretations
    and answers. Therefore, without more context, the question is AMBIGUOUS as it
    could refer to different people with the same names.
  - The question "Did Ying Chang die later than Gu Shao?" is ambiguous because it
    does not provide sufficient context to identify who Ying Chang and Gu Shao are.
    Without additional information to specify which historical figures are being referred
    to, and considering that multiple individuals could share these names across different
    time periods or cultures, the question admits more than one interpretation. This
    lack of specificity can lead to different answers depending on which individuals
    are being considered.
  - The question asks whether Ying Chang died later than Gu Shao, but it does not
    provide specific information about who these individuals are or the context in
    which they are being compared. Without additional details, such as the time periods
    or historical contexts, it is unclear if these are well-known historical figures
    or lesser-known individuals. This lack of context and specificity makes the question
    open to multiple interpretations and potentially different answers depending on
    the identities of the figures in question.
  - The question asks whether Ying Chang died later than Gu Shao. However, without
    additional context, it is unclear who these individuals are, as their names may
    refer to multiple historical figures across different time periods or cultures.
    Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation depending on which
    historical figures named Ying Chang and Gu Shao are being referred to. This leads
    to potential different answers based on the identities of the individuals in question.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative death dates of two historical figures:
    Ying Chang and Gu Shao. However, without additional context or specific historical
    knowledge provided in the question, it is unclear who Ying Chang and Gu Shao are,
    as there might be multiple historical figures with these or similar names. This
    lack of specificity and context leads to ambiguity in determining the exact historical
    figures being referred to, and thus, the answer could vary based on different
    interpretations of who these individuals are.'
  - The question asks whether Ying Chang died later than Gu Shao. However, it is ambiguous
    because it does not provide specific details about who these individuals are.
    There could be multiple historical figures with these names across different periods
    and regions, leading to different interpretations and answers. Without additional
    context or information, it is impossible to determine which Ying Chang and Gu
    Shao are being referred to, thus making the question ambiguous.
  - The question "Did Ying Chang die later than Gu Shao?" requires specific historical
    knowledge about the death dates of two figures, Ying Chang and Gu Shao. However,
    the question is ambiguous because it assumes that the reader knows exactly who
    these historical figures are and that there is only one Ying Chang and one Gu
    Shao in historical records. Without additional context, there could be multiple
    interpretations depending on which historical figures named Ying Chang and Gu
    Shao are being referred to, leading to different answers. Additionally, if these
    figures are not widely recognized, the question's clarity further diminishes.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative timing of the deaths of two historical
    figures: Ying Chang and Gu Shao. However, without additional context or information
    about who these figures are, there could be ambiguity. There might be multiple
    historical figures with similar or identical names, leading to different interpretations
    of who is being referenced. Additionally, if these figures are not well-documented
    or known, it could be difficult to provide a definitive answer based on available
    historical records.'
  - The question asks whether Ying Chang died later than Gu Shao. The ambiguity arises
    because there could be multiple historical figures with the names Ying Chang and
    Gu Shao, especially since these names might not be unique. Without specific context
    or additional identifying information, it is unclear which individuals are being
    referred to, leading to multiple interpretations and potential answers.
  - The question asks whether one historical figure, Ying Chang, died later than another,
    Gu Shao. Without additional context or information about these figures, the question
    is ambiguous. It is unclear who these individuals are, as there may be multiple
    historical figures with these names, or they may not be well-known figures at
    all. Furthermore, without specific dates or additional context, it is impossible
    to determine the order of their deaths. Thus, the question admits more than one
    interpretation, depending on which individuals are being referred to.

    information about which Marcia is meant, the question admits multiple interpretations
    and could lead to different answers depending on the Marcia in question.
  - The question asks whether Zhang Qian died later than Marcia. Without specifying
    which Marcia is being referred to, the question remains ambiguous, as there have
    been multiple historical figures named Marcia. Zhang Qian is a known historical
    figure who lived during the Han dynasty, but without a specific Marcia identified,
    it is not possible to determine the timeline of their respective deaths. This
    lack of specificity allows for multiple interpretations regarding which Marcia
    is being referenced.
  - The question "Did Zhang Qian die later than Marcia?" is ambiguous because it involves
    two historical figures whose timelines may not be universally known or easily
    comparable without additional context. Zhang Qian was a Chinese explorer who lived
    during the Han dynasty, around the 2nd century BC. However, "Marcia" is not specified
    with enough detail to determine which historical figure named Marcia is being
    referenced, as there could be multiple individuals with that name from different
    historical periods. Without specifying which Marcia is meant, the question can
    lead to different interpretations and answers.
  - The question asks about the relative death dates of Zhang Qian and Marcia. However,
    it is ambiguous because "Marcia" is a common name, and without additional context,
    it is unclear which Marcia is being referred to. There could be multiple historical

  - The question asks whether Zhang Qian died later than Marcia. However, the question
    is ambiguous because it does not specify which Marcia is being referred to. There
    could be multiple historical figures named Marcia, and without further context,
    it is impossible to determine which one is meant. Additionally, the dates of death
    for Zhang Qian and any potential Marcias would need to be verified to provide
    an accurate answer.
  - The question "Did Zhang Qian die later than Marcia?" is ambiguous because it refers
    to two historical figures without providing specific dates or additional context.
    Zhang Qian was a Chinese explorer from the Han Dynasty, and Marcia could refer
    to multiple historical figures with that name, such as Marcia, the wife of Commodus.

  - The question asks whether the historical figure Jesus died later than Philip the
    Tetrarch. This question could be considered AMBIGUOUS because the timeline of
    historical Jesus's life and death is subject to interpretation and debate among
    historians. While traditional Christian teachings suggest Jesus died around 30-36
    AD, the exact dates are not universally agreed upon. Philip the Tetrarch's death
    is generally recorded as 34 AD. However, the lack of precise historical records
    and differing historical interpretations about the exact years of Jesus's death
    introduce ambiguity.
  - The question asks whether the historical Jesus died later than Philip the Tetrarch.
    This question is based on historical timelines and dates, which are well-documented
    for both figures. Historical records indicate that Philip the Tetrarch died in
    34 AD, and Jesus is commonly believed to have been crucified around 30-33 AD.

    in 754 AD. Given these specific dates, the question is asking whether 753 AD is
    later than 754 AD, which has a clear, singular interpretation. There are no multiple
    interpretations or ambiguous elements in the phrasing of the question. The death
    years are specific and lead to one correct answer: Saint Pirmin died before Cui
    Hao.


    Therefore, the question is straightforward and admits only one interpretation
    and one correct answer.'
  - 'The question asks whether Saint Pirmin died later than Cui Hao. This question
    involves comparing the death dates of two historical figures, which is a factual
    inquiry. Assuming accurate historical records exist for both individuals, there
    is only one interpretation of the question: determining the chronological order
    of their deaths. Therefore, this question does not allow for multiple interpretations
    and should have a definitive answer based on historical data.'

  - The question asks whether Turibius of Astorga died later than Felix Ennodius.
    To determine if the question is clear or ambiguous, we need to consider if there
    is only one interpretation and one correct answer. Historical records typically
    contain specific dates or timeframes for the deaths of historical figures. However,
    if the historical records for these figures are incomplete, conflicting, or subject
    to interpretation, the question could become ambiguous. Without additional context
    or universally accepted historical data about the death dates of Turibius of Astorga
    and Felix Ennodius, different historians might provide different answers. Therefore,
    the question could be interpreted in multiple ways if the historical records are
    not definitive.
  - 'The question is asking for a comparison of the death dates of two historical
    figures: Turibius of Astorga and Felix Ennodius. This is a factual question that
    requires specific historical data to answer. There is only one correct interpretation,
    which is to determine the chronological order of their deaths. Therefore, the
    question is clear in its intent and scope.'
  - The question asks whether Turibius of Astorga died later than Felix Ennodius.
    This is a straightforward historical question that requires looking up the death
    dates of the two individuals to determine the answer. There is only one interpretation
    and one correct answer to this question based on historical records.
  - 'The question asks about the death dates of two historical figures: Turibius of
    Astorga and Felix Ennodius. To determine if the question is clear or ambiguous,
    we need to consider if there is any uncertainty or multiple interpretations in
    the dates of their deaths. Turibius of Astorga is known to have died around 460
    AD, while Felix Ennodius is known to have died around 521 AD. Since the death
    dates of these historical figures are well-documented and there is no room for
    alternative interpretations, the question has only one interpretation and one
    correct answer.'
  - The question is asking whether Turibius of Astorga died later than Felix Ennodius.
    To determine if the question is CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS, we need to consider the historical
    context and available information. Turibius of Astorga was a bishop who lived
    during the 5th century, and Felix Ennodius, also known as Magnus Felix Ennodius,
    was a bishop and writer who lived around the late 5th to early 6th century. The
    question is specific about comparing the death dates of these two historical figures.
    However, the potential ambiguity arises if the historical records about their
    death dates are not precise or universally agreed upon, leading to different interpretations
    of the available historical evidence. In this case, while the question itself
    is straightforward, the possibility of varying historical interpretations makes
    it AMBIGUOUS because it relies on historical data that may not be definitive or
    clear-cut.
  - "The question asks whether Turibius of Astorga died later than Felix Ennodius.\
    \ To classify this as CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS, we need to consider the following: \n\
    \n1. The question involves comparing the death dates of two historical figures,\
    \ Turibius of Astorga and Felix Ennodius. \n2. If both figures have well-documented\
    \ and undisputed dates of death, the question is straightforward and would be\
    \ classified as CLEAR.\n3. However, if there is uncertainty or multiple historical\
    \ records regarding the death dates of either or both figures, the question could\
    \ be classified as AMBIGUOUS due to the potential for different interpretations\
    \ or answers based on varying sources.\n\nGiven that historical records can sometimes\
    \ be inconsistent, there is a potential for ambiguity unless the dates are universally\
    \ agreed upon by historical consensus. Without specific information about the\

  - The question asks whether Barca Hamilcar died later than Huan Yi. This requires
    knowledge of the death dates of two historical figures. However, there could be
    ambiguity due to variations in historical records, different interpretations of
    historical timelines, or even confusion over which historical figures are being
    referred to if there are multiple individuals with similar names. Without specific
    dates provided or widely recognized dates for these figures, the question can
    be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the historical sources referenced.
  - The question asks about the relative timing of the deaths of two historical figures,
    Barca Hamilcar and Huan Yi. To classify this question, we need to consider whether
    there is any ambiguity in the identities or timelines of these figures. Barca
    Hamilcar, also known as Hamilcar Barca, was a Carthaginian general who lived during
    the 3rd century BCE. Huan Yi was a Chinese general from the Qin dynasty, also
    from the 3rd century BCE. Given that both figures lived in different parts of
    the world and during overlapping time periods, the question is straightforward
    in asking for a comparison of their death dates. There is no ambiguity in interpreting
    the question itself; it is a factual inquiry based on historical records. Thus,
    the question has one interpretation and seeks a factual comparison.
  - The question asks whether Barca Hamilcar died later than Huan Yi. To determine
    if the question is clear or ambiguous, we need to consider the historical context
    and the available information about these figures. Barca Hamilcar, also known
    as Hamilcar Barca, was a Carthaginian general who died in 228 BC. Huan Yi, on
    the other hand, is a less well-documented figure, and historical records about
    his life and death are not as readily available or might be inconsistent. This
    lack of clear historical records for Huan Yi's death date makes it challenging
    to definitively answer the question. Therefore, the question admits more than
    one interpretation because the answer depends on the availability and reliability
    of historical data, which could lead to different answers depending on the sources
    referenced.
  - The question asks whether Barca Hamilcar died later than Huan Yi, comparing the
    death dates of two historical figures. However, this question is AMBIGUOUS because
    it assumes the reader knows who these figures are and their death dates. Without
    specifying which Huan Yi is being referred to (as there may be multiple historical
    figures with similar names) or providing more context about these individuals,
    the question can lead to different interpretations and therefore different answers.
    Additionally, the historical records regarding these figures might not be definitive
    or well-documented, adding to the ambiguity.
  - The question involves two historical figures, Barca Hamilcar and Huan Yi, and
    asks whether one died later than the other. This requires knowledge of the death
    dates of both individuals. However, the question is ambiguous because "Huan Yi"
    could refer to multiple historical figures or be a misinterpretation of a name,
    leading to different answers depending on which "Huan Yi" is considered. Therefore,
    the question admits more than one interpretation.
  - 'The question asks whether Barca Hamilcar died later than Huan Yi. To determine
    the clarity, we need to consider the historical figures mentioned: Barca Hamilcar,
    a Carthaginian general who lived during the 3rd century BC, and Huan Yi, which
    could be a reference to a less well-known or possibly misnamed historical figure.
    The ambiguity arises because "Huan Yi" is not a widely recognized historical figure,
    making it difficult to determine the exact person in question and their corresponding
    death date. Without clear identification of both figures, the question is open
    to multiple interpretations regarding who "Huan Yi" refers to, leading to different
    possible answers.'
  - The question asks whether Barca Hamilcar died later than Huan Yi. To answer this,
    one would need to know the dates of death of both historical figures. The question
    is not open to multiple interpretations; it is a straightforward comparison of
    two historical dates. Therefore, it is a clear question with one correct answer
    based on historical records.
  - The question asks whether Barca Hamilcar died later than Huan Yi. To answer this
    question, one must know the dates of death for both historical figures. However,
    the question does not provide any context about who these figures are, and there
    might be multiple individuals with similar names across history. For instance,
    Barca Hamilcar could refer to Hamilcar Barca, a well-known Carthaginian general,
    while Huan Yi might refer to a less widely known figure, potentially leading to
    confusion. Due to the potential for multiple interpretations of who these individuals
    might be, the question can lead to different answers depending on which historical
    figures are being referenced.
  - The question asks whether Barca Hamilcar died later than Huan Yi. This requires
    knowledge of the death dates of both historical figures. However, the question
    is ambiguous because it does not specify which Huan Yi it refers to, as there
    could be multiple historical figures with that name. Without clarification, the
    question admits more than one interpretation, leading to potential different answers
    based on which Huan Yi is being referenced.
  - The question asks whether Barca Hamilcar died later than Huan Yi. Both are historical
    figures, but there may be ambiguity regarding the specific identities of these
    figures due to potential variations in historical records or similar-sounding
    names. Hamilcar Barca was a Carthaginian general who died in 228 BC, while Huan
    Yi could refer to different individuals depending on historical context. Without
    clear identification of who Huan Yi is, the question could lead to different answers
    based on interpretations of which Huan Yi is being referenced.

  - The question asks for a comparison between the death dates of Wilhelm Steffensen
    and Albert Einstein. Albert Einstein's date of death is well-known (April 18,
    1955). However, the question is ambiguous because "Wilhelm Steffensen" is not
    a widely recognized historical figure, and without additional context or information
    about who this person is, it's unclear how to accurately answer the question.
    There could be multiple individuals with the name "Wilhelm Steffensen," leading
    to different interpretations and answers depending on which person is being referred
    to.
  - The question asks about the death dates of two historical figures, Wilhelm Steffensen
    and Albert Einstein, to determine who died later. The question presupposes that
    Wilhelm Steffensen is a well-known historical figure with a recorded death date,
    similar to Albert Einstein. However, there is ambiguity because Wilhelm Steffensen
    is not a widely recognized historical figure, and there may be multiple individuals
    with that name. Without additional context to identify the specific Wilhelm Steffensen
    in question, the answer could vary. Therefore, the question admits more than one
    interpretation and could lead to different answers depending on the context or
    individual being referred to.
  - 'The question asks whether Wilhelm Steffensen died later than Albert Einstein.
    To determine if this question is clear or ambiguous, we consider if there''s any
    room for interpretation. The question is straightforward: it asks for a comparison
    of the death dates of two specific individuals. Given historical records, Wilhelm
    Steffensen (also known as Vilhjalmur Stefansson) died in 1962, and Albert Einstein
    died in 1955. Therefore, the question admits only one interpretation and a single
    correct answer based on historical data.'
  - The question is asking for a comparison of the dates of death of Wilhelm Steffensen
    and Albert Einstein. Albert Einstein's date of death is known (April 18, 1955),
    but without additional context or information about who Wilhelm Steffensen is
    and when he died, it is unclear if this question can be answered definitively.
    This uncertainty makes the question ambiguous, as it depends on identifying Wilhelm
    Steffensen and verifying his date of death. Without this information, the question
    can have different interpretations based on different assumptions about who Wilhelm
    Steffensen might be.
  - The question asks whether Wilhelm Steffensen died later than Albert Einstein.
    This question is potentially ambiguous because it assumes knowledge about two
    historical figures whose lifespans need to be compared. If the identities and
    death dates of both individuals are clear and well-documented, the question can
    be answered definitively. However, if there is any confusion about who Wilhelm
    Steffensen is (as he is not a widely recognized historical figure compared to
    Albert Einstein), or if there are multiple individuals with that name, the question
    could be interpreted in different ways, leading to uncertainty about which Wilhelm
    Steffensen is being referred to and what the correct answer might be.
  - The question asks whether Wilhelm Steffensen died later than Albert Einstein.
    To answer this question, one would need the specific dates of death for both individuals.
    However, the ambiguity arises because "Wilhelm Steffensen" is not a widely recognized
    historical figure, and there may be multiple individuals with that name. Without
    additional context or specification about who "Wilhelm Steffensen" refers to,
    the question could lead to different interpretations depending on which Wilhelm
    Steffensen one assumes is being referenced. Additionally, the common historical
    figure is Vilhjalmur Stefansson, which could lead to confusion if this is a typographical
    error.
  - 'The question asks for a comparison of the death dates of two individuals: Wilhelm
    Steffensen and Albert Einstein. The question is clear in its request for a chronological
    comparison of their death dates. Albert Einstein died on April 18, 1955. However,
    the ambiguity arises from the identity of "Wilhelm Steffensen," as there is no
    widely known historical figure by that exact name. This could lead to different
    interpretations, as the question might be referring to someone with a similar
    name or a less-known individual, thus making it difficult to provide a definitive
    answer without further context.'
  - The question asks about the death dates of two historical figures, Wilhelm Steffensen

  - The question asks whether Wilhelm Steffensen died later than Albert Einstein.
    To answer this, one would need to know the death dates of both individuals. However,
    there is some ambiguity because "Wilhelm Steffensen" is not a widely recognized
    historical figure, and the question does not provide additional context to identify
    him uniquely. This could lead to multiple interpretations depending on which Wilhelm
    Steffensen is being referred to, if any. On the other hand, Albert Einstein is
    a well-known figure, and his death date is a matter of historical record. Therefore,
    the ambiguity arises from the lack of clarity about the identity of Wilhelm Steffensen.

  - The question asks whether Zhiyi died later than Liu Zhen. For this question to
    be classified as CLEAR, it would need to reference specific historical figures
    whose identities and death dates are well-documented and agreed upon. However,
    both "Zhiyi" and "Liu Zhen" could potentially refer to multiple historical figures
    across different periods and cultures, leading to ambiguity. Without additional
    context to specify which Zhiyi and Liu Zhen are being referred to, the question
    admits multiple interpretations. Therefore, the lack of specificity regarding
    the identities of these historical figures makes it difficult to provide a single
    correct answer.
  - The question asks about the chronological order of the deaths of two historical
    figures, Zhiyi and Liu Zhen. To determine if the question is clear or ambiguous,
    we need to assess whether there is only one possible interpretation. The question
    explicitly specifies the comparison of death dates, which is a factual query.
    If both figures are well-documented and their death dates are known, the question
    would be clear. However, if there is any uncertainty or multiple interpretations
    regarding the identity of the figures (such as different historical figures with
    similar names) or their death dates, the question could be ambiguous. Without
    additional context, it is unclear if there is only one known Zhiyi and Liu Zhen
    with documented death dates. Thus, the question could be interpreted in multiple
    ways depending on the historical context or records available.
  - The question asks whether Zhiyi died later than Liu Zhen, which seems straightforward
    at first glance. However, without additional context, it is ambiguous. "Zhiyi"
    and "Liu Zhen" could refer to multiple historical figures with those names, as
    both names are not unique. For instance, Zhiyi could refer to the Chinese Tiantai
    Buddhist monk who lived during the 6th century, and Liu Zhen could refer to various
    figures from different periods. Without specific timeframes or additional identifiers,
    it's unclear which individuals are being referenced, leading to different possible
    interpretations and answers.
  - The question is asking about the relative dates of death of two historical figures,
    Zhiyi and Liu Zhen. To determine if the question is clear or ambiguous, we need
    to consider whether there is only one way to interpret the question and whether
    it admits a single correct answer. The question seems straightforward, asking
    for a comparison of death dates, which should have definitive historical answers.
    However, the ambiguity arises from the fact that without specific historical context
    or clarification on which Liu Zhen is being referred to (as there could be multiple
    historical figures with that name), it might not be possible to provide a definitive
    answer. Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation due to the
    potential for confusion about the identity of Liu Zhen.
  - The question asks for a comparison of the death dates of two historical figures,
    Zhiyi and Liu Zhen. The clarity of the question relies on the assumption that
    both individuals are well-known and have undisputed death dates in historical
    records. However, if there is ambiguity or lack of consensus in historical sources
    about the exact dates of death for either Zhiyi or Liu Zhen, or if there is confusion
    about which individuals are being referenced (e.g., if there are multiple historical
    figures with similar names), the question could lead to different interpretations.
    Without additional context or specific historical knowledge, there is potential
    for ambiguity.
  - The question asks whether Zhiyi died later than Liu Zhen. This question assumes
    a specific context where both individuals are known historical figures, and their
    dates of death are established. However, without additional context or clarification,
    it's unclear which specific individuals named Zhiyi and Liu Zhen are being referred
    to, as there might be multiple historical figures with these names. This ambiguity
    in identifying the correct individuals can lead to different interpretations and
    answers.
  - The question asks whether Zhiyi died later than Liu Zhen. To answer this, one
    would need specific historical data on the death dates of both Zhiyi and Liu Zhen.
    The question seems straightforward, asking for a comparison of two specific historical
    events (their deaths). However, ambiguity arises if there are multiple historical
    figures named Zhiyi or Liu Zhen, as the question does not specify which individuals
    it refers to. Without additional context or clarification on which Zhiyi and Liu
    Zhen are being referenced, the question admits more than one interpretation, leading
    to potential different answers depending on the historical figures considered.
  - The question asks about the relative dates of death of two historical figures,
    Zhiyi and Liu Zhen. Without additional context or information about these individuals,
    it is unclear who they are and whether there might be multiple historical figures
    with the same names. This lack of specificity makes it difficult to definitively
    determine the order of their deaths without more information, leading to potential
    multiple interpretations or answers depending on which individuals are being referred
    to.
  - The question asks whether Zhiyi died later than Liu Zhen. However, without specifying
    which individuals with these names are being referred to (since there could be
    multiple historical figures with the same name), the question can lead to different
    interpretations. Therefore, it admits more than one interpretation, which could
    result in different answers based on the specific historical figures in question.
  - The question asks about the death dates of two historical figures, Zhiyi and Liu
    Zhen, and whether Zhiyi died later than Liu Zhen. The question is specific and
    only requires historical data to answer it. However, the ambiguity arises from
    the possibility of multiple individuals named Liu Zhen throughout history. Without
    specifying which Liu Zhen is being referred to, the question can admit more than
    one interpretation, leading to different answers based on which Liu Zhen is considered.

  - 'The question asks about the relative timing of the deaths of two historical figures,
    Li Mao and Dugu Ji. The interpretation of the question is straightforward: it
    inquires whether the death of Li Mao occurred after the death of Dugu Ji. However,
    the ambiguity arises if there is a lack of consensus or clarity in historical
    records about the exact dates of their deaths. If the historical records are clear
    and agreed upon, then the question has one interpretation and one correct answer.
    If there are conflicting historical accounts, it could lead to different interpretations
    regarding who died later.'
  - The question asks whether Li Mao died later than Dugu Ji. To answer this, one
    would need clear historical records of the death dates of both individuals. However,
    if there is any uncertainty or lack of information about the exact death dates
    of either Li Mao or Dugu Ji, the question could become ambiguous. Additionally,
    if there are multiple historical figures with similar names or if the names refer
    to different people in different contexts or time periods, this could also lead
    to ambiguity. Without explicit context or clarification about which Li Mao and
    Dugu Ji are being referred to, the question admits more than one interpretation
    and could lead to different answers based on varying historical records or interpretations.
  - The question "Did Li Mao die later than Dugu Ji?" requires specific historical
    information about the death dates of Li Mao and Dugu Ji. However, without additional
    context, it is unclear which Li Mao or Dugu Ji the question refers to, as there
    may be multiple historical figures with these names. This lack of specificity
    can lead to multiple interpretations and potentially different answers depending
    on the historical figures being considered.
  - The question asks whether Li Mao died later than Dugu Ji. However, the ambiguity
    arises because there could be multiple historical figures with the same name,
    and without specifying which Li Mao or Dugu Ji is being referred to, the question
    can be interpreted in different ways. Additionally, the question assumes the existence
    of historical records for both figures' death dates, which may not be readily
    available or agreed upon by historians. Thus, the question admits more than one
    interpretation and could lead to different answers depending on the specific individuals
    being considered.
  - The question asks whether Li Mao died later than Dugu Ji. However, without specifying
    which Li Mao or Dugu Ji is being referred to, there is ambiguity. Multiple historical
    figures could have similar names, leading to different interpretations and answers.
    Therefore, the question is AMBIGUOUS because it does not provide enough context
    to determine which individuals are being compared.
  - The question asks about the death dates of two historical figures, Li Mao and
    Dugu Ji. For the question to be classified as CLEAR, it would need to be based
    on well-documented historical facts where the dates of death for both individuals
    are undisputed and widely accepted. However, if there is a lack of historical
    consensus or documentation about the exact death dates of these figures, the question
    becomes AMBIGUOUS because it could lead to different interpretations based on
    varying historical sources or scholarly opinions.
  - The question asks whether Li Mao died later than Dugu Ji, which involves comparing
    the death dates of two historical figures. However, without specific context or
    clarification, the question is ambiguous. There could be multiple individuals
    with the names Li Mao and Dugu Ji, leading to different interpretations of who
    exactly is being referred to. Additionally, historical records might not have
    precise or universally agreed-upon death dates for these figures, leading to potential
    discrepancies in answers.
  - The question asks about the relative times of death of two historical figures,
    Li Mao and Dugu Ji. For the question to be clear, it must be established that
    both individuals are well-documented historical figures with known dates of death.
    If either figure lacks a precise or agreed-upon date of death, the question becomes
    ambiguous due to the potential for multiple interpretations of historical records.
    Additionally, if there are multiple individuals known by these names, the question
    could be ambiguous unless further context is provided to specify which individuals
    are being referred to.
  - The question asks about the relative death dates of two historical figures, Li
    Mao and Dugu Ji. However, the ambiguity arises from the lack of specificity regarding
    which Li Mao or Dugu Ji is being referenced, as there could be multiple historical
    figures with these names. Without additional context or specification, it is unclear
    which individuals are being compared, leading to potential multiple interpretations
    and answers.
  - The question asks if Li Mao died later than Dugu Ji. For this to be classified
    as CLEAR, the dates of death for both historical figures would need to be well-documented
    and universally agreed upon, allowing for a straightforward comparison. However,
    if there is uncertainty or multiple interpretations regarding the death dates
    of either Li Mao or Dugu Ji due to varying historical records, the question becomes
    AMBIGUOUS. Historical records, especially for figures from ancient times, can
    often have discrepancies or lack precise information, leading to potential ambiguity.

  - The question asks whether Lu Ban died later than Zengzi. This question could be
    interpreted in a straightforward manner as a comparison of the death dates of
    two historical figures. Lu Ban is traditionally believed to have lived during
    the Spring and Autumn period of Chinese history, while Zengzi, a disciple of Confucius,
    lived during the late Spring and Autumn and early Warring States periods. However,
    the exact dates of their lives are not precisely documented, leading to potential
    ambiguity in determining who died later. The lack of precise historical records
    for these figures means that the question could lead to different interpretations
    based on varying historical sources or scholarly opinions.
  - The question asks about the chronological order of the deaths of two historical
    figures, Lu Ban and Zengzi. To determine if Lu Ban died later than Zengzi, we
    would need specific historical information about the years or dates of their deaths.
    Lu Ban is traditionally dated to have lived during the Spring and Autumn period,
    around the 5th century BCE, while Zengzi, a disciple of Confucius, is generally
    dated to the late 5th century BCE. Given these historical contexts, the question
    is straightforward and asks for a factual comparison of dates, which means it

  - The question asks whether Lu Ban died later than Zengzi, which appears to be a
    straightforward comparison of their dates of death. However, it is ambiguous due
    to the historical uncertainty around the exact dates of death for both figures.
    Lu Ban, a legendary Chinese figure, is traditionally dated to have lived during
    the Spring and Autumn period, but exact dates are not well-documented. Zengzi,
    a disciple of Confucius, also has uncertain dates, though he is generally placed
    in the 5th century BCE. The lack of precise historical records for both figures
    makes it difficult to definitively answer the question, leading to potential multiple
    interpretations based on differing historical sources.

  - The question is asking for a comparison of the death dates of two historical figures,
    Zhang Jun and Al-Khazini. The question can be interpreted clearly in terms of
    historical timelines and does not inherently suggest multiple interpretations.
    The answer depends on historical records, which should provide a specific death
    date for each figure, allowing for a definitive comparison.
  - The question asks whether Zhang Jun died later than Al-Khazini, which seems straightforward.
    However, there are potential ambiguities. First, there could be multiple historical
    figures named Zhang Jun, as this is not an uncommon name in Chinese history. Without
    specifying which Zhang Jun is being referred to, it is unclear. Similarly, without
    specific dates or contexts provided, it's possible that there could be different
    historical interpretations or records regarding their death dates. Therefore,
    the question could be interpreted in different ways depending on which historical
    figures are being considered.
  - The question asks whether Zhang Jun died later than Al-Khazini. To determine whether
    this question is clear or ambiguous, we must consider the clarity of the identities
    of Zhang Jun and Al-Khazini. The potential ambiguity arises from the fact that
    there could be multiple historical figures with the same names. Zhang Jun could
    refer to different individuals throughout history, and Al-Khazini, a historical
    figure known for his contributions to science in the Islamic Golden Age, could
    also potentially be confused with others if not properly specified. Without additional
    context or specific identification of which Zhang Jun is being referred to, the
    question could lead to multiple interpretations and answers.
  - The question asks whether Zhang Jun died later than Al-Khazini. To answer it,
    one would need specific historical information regarding the death dates of both
    individuals. The question is straightforward in its request for a comparison of
    two dates, and it does not present multiple interpretations. Therefore, it admits
    only one interpretation and one correct answer based on historical data.
  - The question asks if Zhang Jun died later than Al-Khazini. However, there are
    multiple historical figures known as Zhang Jun, each with different lifespans.
    Without specifying which Zhang Jun is being referred to, the question becomes
    ambiguous as it could refer to different individuals with potentially different
    answers. Al-Khazini refers to a known historical figure, but the ambiguity lies
    in the identity of Zhang Jun.
  - The question asks whether Zhang Jun died later than Al-Khazini. On the surface,
    it seems clear as it compares the dates of death of two historical figures. However,
    it can be considered ambiguous because there are multiple historical figures with
    the name Zhang Jun, and the question does not specify which Zhang Jun it is referring
    to. Without specifying which Zhang Jun is being referenced, the question can lead
    to different interpretations and potentially different answers depending on which
    Zhang Jun is considered.
  - The question asks whether Zhang Jun died later than Al-Khazini. This requires
    historical knowledge about the death dates of both individuals. If the historical
    records of their death dates are clear and undisputed, the question would be considered
    clear. However, historical records can sometimes be incomplete or contradictory,
    leading to potential ambiguity in interpreting the exact dates of death. Without
    specific context or universally accepted historical records, the question can
    be seen as ambiguous due to potential variations in historical accounts.
  - The question asks whether Zhang Jun died later than Al-Khazini. However, the ambiguity
    arises from the fact that there are multiple historical figures with the name
    Zhang Jun, and without additional context specifying which Zhang Jun is being
    referred to, it is impossible to definitively answer the question. Additionally,
    the historical record for Al-Khazini's death might not be precise, adding another
    layer of uncertainty.
  - 'The question asks for a comparison of the death dates of two historical figures:
    Zhang Jun and Al-Khazini. To determine whether the question is clear or ambiguous,
    we need to consider if there is any potential for multiple interpretations or
    answers.


    Zhang Jun and Al-Khazini are specific individuals, and their death dates are historical
    facts. Therefore, the question is asking for a factual comparison between two
    specific dates, which only admits one interpretation. The answer to the question
    depends solely on the historical record of their death dates, which is a clear
    and singular interpretation.


    However, ambiguity could arise if there is any historical uncertainty or dispute
    about the exact dates of death for either individual. But, given that the question
    is structured as a straightforward comparison, it implies that there is a generally
    accepted understanding of these dates.


    In conclusion, the question is clear in its request for a factual comparison of
    death dates, assuming there is no significant historical dispute over the dates
    themselves.'
  - The question asks whether Zhang Jun died later than Al-Khazini. To determine if
    the question is clear or ambiguous, we need to consider the historical context
    and available information about these figures. Zhang Jun, a Chinese statesman
    of the Song dynasty, died in 1147. Al-Khazini, a Persian scientist, died sometime
    after 1130, but the exact year of his death is not precisely recorded. The ambiguity
    arises because Al-Khazini's exact death year is not definitively known, which
    could lead to different interpretations regarding who died later. Therefore, the
    lack of precise information about Al-Khazini's death year makes it impossible
    to provide a single correct answer to the question.

  - The question asks whether Zhang Yue died later than Gregory II. While the question
    seems straightforward, it is ambiguous because it relies on knowing the exact
    dates of death for both historical figures, which are not provided in the question.
    Without additional context or specific dates, one could interpret the question
    in multiple ways, such as asking about different individuals with similar names
    or questioning the validity of historical records. Therefore, due to the lack
    of specificity and potential for multiple interpretations, the question is ambiguous.
  - 'The question asks whether Zhang Yue died later than Gregory II. To determine

  - The question asks whether Zhang Yue died later than Gregory II. This requires
    a comparison of the death dates of two historical figures. Zhang Yue was a Tang
    dynasty official who died in 731 AD, while Gregory II was a Pope who died in 731
    AD as well. Since both individuals died in the same year, the question could be
    interpreted as asking for an exact date comparison, which historical records may
    not provide with precision. Thus, the question admits more than one interpretation
    depending on the level of precision required or available in the historical records,
    leading to potential ambiguity in determining who died later.
  - 'The question involves comparing the death dates of two historical figures: Zhang
    Yue and Gregory II. However, the question does not specify which Gregory II is
    being referred to, as there have been multiple individuals with that name throughout
    history (e.g., Gregory II the Pope, Gregory II of Naples, etc.). Without a specific
    context or additional information about which Gregory II is intended, the question
    admits more than one interpretation, which could lead to different answers depending
    on the individual being considered.'
  - 'The question asks whether Zhang Yue died later than Gregory II. This question
    involves two historical figures: Zhang Yue, a Chinese official and poet of the

    uncertain or vary based on different historical sources. However, generally accepted
    historical records state that Zhang Yue died in 730 and Gregory II died in 731.
    Based on these dates, the question can be interpreted clearly, but if there were
    discrepancies in historical records, it might lead to different interpretations.
    Despite potential minor ambiguities in historical records, the question as phrased
    is likely intended to have one clear answer based on widely accepted historical
    dates.'
  - The question asks whether Zhang Yue died later than Gregory II. At first glance,
    this may seem straightforward, but it is actually ambiguous due to potential confusion
    about which historical figures are being referred to, as well as possible variations
    in historical records. Zhang Yue was a Chinese official who died in 732 AD, and
    Gregory II was a Pope who died in 731 AD. However, without specifying the time
    periods or providing full names, there could be multiple individuals with the
    same or similar names, leading to ambiguity in determining the exact individuals
    in question.
  - The question asks whether Zhang Yue died later than Gregory II. The question is
    potentially ambiguous because it assumes knowledge of specific historical figures
    and their timelines. Zhang Yue could refer to different people with that name
    in history, although the most well-known Zhang Yue was a Tang dynasty official
    who died in 731 AD. Gregory II typically refers to Pope Gregory II, who died in
    731 AD. If these are the figures in question, the answer would be clear. However,
    without specifying which Zhang Yue is meant, the question could admit multiple
    interpretations and potentially different answers.
  - The question asks whether Zhang Yue died later than Gregory II. This question
    could be considered ambiguous because it involves two historical figures from
    different cultures and time periods. The ambiguity arises from the lack of specific
    context or additional information about which Zhang Yue is being referred to,
    as there might be multiple historical figures with that name. Without specifying
    which Zhang Yue is meant, the question could lead to different interpretations
    and answers depending on the context assumed by the respondent.
  - The question asks whether Zhang Yue died later than Gregory II. This requires
    historical knowledge of the death dates of both individuals. Zhang Yue was a Chinese
    official and poet who lived during the Tang dynasty and died in 730 AD. Gregory

    The question is straightforward and does not admit multiple interpretations or
    answers.
  - 'The question asks about the relative death dates of two historical figures: Zhang
    Yue and Gregory II. For this question to be clear, it would require that there
    is a consensus on who these individuals are and the exact dates of their deaths.
    Zhang Yue is likely referring to a Chinese official and poet from the Tang Dynasty,
    who died in 730 AD. Gregory II is likely referring to Pope Gregory II, who died
    in 731 AD. Based on these interpretations, the question seems to have a clear
    answer: Zhang Yue died before Gregory II. However, if there is any ambiguity regarding
    which Zhang Yue or Gregory II is being referred to (in case there are multiple
    historical figures with these names), the question could admit multiple interpretations.
    In historical contexts, such ambiguities can arise due to the existence of multiple

  - The question asks whether Liu Mei died later than Bernward of Hildesheim. To determine
    if this question is clear or ambiguous, we need to consider if the identities
    of Liu Mei and Bernward of Hildesheim are well-defined and if the dates of their
    deaths are known. Bernward of Hildesheim is a well-documented historical figure,
    having died in 1022. However, Liu Mei is not a widely recognized historical figure,
    which introduces ambiguity. Without specific historical records identifying Liu
    Mei and the date of her death, the question becomes open to interpretation. Therefore,
    the question is ambiguous because it relies on the identification of a potentially
    obscure figure, which could lead to different interpretations and answers.
  - The question asks for a comparison of the death dates of two historical figures,
    Liu Mei and Bernward of Hildesheim. To determine if it is clear or ambiguous,
    we need to consider whether there could be multiple interpretations. Both individuals
    are historical figures, and their death dates should be historical facts. Therefore,
    if the death dates are known and recorded, the question would have one correct
    answer based on those facts. However, if there is any uncertainty or lack of consensus
    about the exact death dates of either or both figures, the question could become
    ambiguous. Assuming the death dates are well-documented and agreed upon by historians,
    the question would be clear.
  - This question is AMBIGUOUS because it does not provide enough context to determine
    which Liu Mei is being referred to, as there may be multiple historical figures
    with that name. Additionally, without specific dates or additional information,
    it is not possible to definitively compare their death dates to Bernward of Hildesheim,
    who died in 1022.
  - 'The question asks for a comparison of the death dates of two historical figures:
    Liu Mei and Bernward of Hildesheim. For the question to be classified as CLEAR,

    referenced, the question admits more than one interpretation. In contrast, Bernward
    of Hildesheim is a well-documented historical figure, a bishop in the 10th and

  - This question is AMBIGUOUS because it does not provide enough context about which
    specific historical figures named Dou Xian and Liu Shu are being referred to.
    Multiple individuals throughout history could have these names, and without additional
    information, it is not possible to determine which specific Dou Xian and Liu Shu
    are being compared. Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation
    and could lead to different answers depending on the context.
  - The question asks whether Dou Xian died later than Liu Shu. The question is clear
    in its structure, requesting a comparison of the death dates of two historical
    figures. However, the ambiguity arises because there are multiple historical figures
    with the name Liu Shu, and without additional context specifying which Liu Shu
    is being referred to, the question admits more than one interpretation. Thus,
    the answer could vary depending on which Liu Shu is considered.

  - The question asks about the relative dates of death of two historical figures,
    William le Scrope, 1st Earl of Wiltshire, and Adam Tutbury. To determine the clarity
    of the question, we need to assess whether the historical records provide a clear
    and definitive answer. William le Scrope is a known historical figure with a recorded
    date of death. However, Adam Tutbury is not a widely recognized figure, and there
    might be ambiguity regarding his identity or the exact date of his death. Without
    clear and consistent historical records for Adam Tutbury, the question becomes
    ambiguous because it relies on potentially unclear or disputed historical information.
    Therefore, the interpretation of the question could vary based on the historical
    sources available.
  - The question asks whether William le Scrope, 1st Earl of Wiltshire, died later
    than Adam Tutbury. This question requires specific historical knowledge about
    the death dates of these two individuals. The question assumes that both individuals
    have recorded death dates, and it seeks a comparison between these two dates.
    Given that historical records can provide specific dates of death for these figures,
    the question can be interpreted in only one way and has a definitive answer based
    on historical data.
  - The question asks whether William le Scrope, 1st Earl of Wiltshire, died later
    than Adam Tutbury. To answer this, we need specific death dates for both historical
    figures. However, the question is clear in its request for a comparative analysis
    of their death dates. Assuming accurate historical records are available, this
    question has one interpretation and one correct answer based on historical data.
  - 'The question involves comparing the death dates of two historical figures: William
    le Scrope, 1st Earl of Wiltshire, and Adam Tutbury. To determine whether the question
    is clear or ambiguous, one must verify if the death dates of both individuals
    are well-documented and uncontroversial. William le Scrope is known to have been
    executed in 1399. However, there is limited information available about Adam Tutbury,
    making it difficult to ascertain his death date and compare it reliably. This
    lack of clarity about one of the individuals introduces ambiguity because the
    answer could vary based on different historical records or interpretations.'

    than Adam Tutbury. To determine if this question is clear or ambiguous, we need
    to consider the potential for multiple interpretations or the availability of
    historical records. William le Scrope's date of death is historically documented
    as 1399. However, information about Adam Tutbury is not widely known or readily
    available, which could lead to ambiguity in answering the question, as different
    sources might provide varying details about Adam Tutbury's life and death. The
    lack of widely recognized information about Adam Tutbury introduces ambiguity
    because it is unclear whether his death date is earlier or later than William
    le Scrope's without specific historical records.
  - The question asks whether William le Scrope, 1st Earl of Wiltshire, died later
    than Adam Tutbury. This question is ambiguous because it relies on historical
    records that may not clearly establish the dates of death for both individuals.
    Furthermore, there might be different historical interpretations or sources with
    conflicting information regarding the dates of death for these figures. Without
    universally accepted dates, the question could lead to different answers depending
    on the sources consulted.
  - The question asks whether William le Scrope, 1st Earl of Wiltshire, died later
    than Adam Tutbury. To determine if the question is clear or ambiguous, we must
    consider the historical records of the deaths of these two figures. If the exact
    dates of death for both individuals are well-documented and uncontroversial, the
    question is clear because it would have a definitive answer. However, if the dates
    of death for either or both figures are not well-documented or are subject to
    historical debate, the question becomes ambiguous as it could lead to different
    interpretations based on varying historical sources.
  - The question asks whether William le Scrope, 1st Earl of Wiltshire, died later
    than Adam Tutbury. The question is specific about the individuals involved and
    seeks a comparison of their death dates. If historical records provide clear death
    dates for both individuals, the question would have a definitive answer. However,
    if historical records are unclear, disputed, or non-existent for one or both figures,
    the question may become ambiguous. Assuming historical records are clear and available,
    the question would admit only one interpretation and one correct answer based
    on those records.

  - The question is asking for a comparison of the death dates of two historical figures,
    Sisinnius and Aldhelm. This is a straightforward question if the dates of death
    for both individuals are known. Sisinnius was a Pope who died in 708, and Aldhelm,
    an Anglo-Saxon bishop, died in 709. Given these facts, the question can be answered
    definitively, and there is only one correct interpretation regarding who died
    later.
  - The question asks whether Sisinnius died later than Aldhelm, involving two historical
    figures. To determine if the question is clear or ambiguous, we need to consider
    if there is a single, definitive answer based on historical records. Sisinnius,
    who was a pope, died in 708 AD, and Aldhelm, an Anglo-Saxon bishop, died in 709
    AD. The historical records provide specific dates for their deaths, which allows
    us to answer the question definitively. Since the question refers to specific
    historical facts with only one correct answer, it admits only one interpretation.
  - The question asks whether Sisinnius died later than Aldhelm, which involves comparing
    the death dates of two historical figures. However, it is ambiguous due to potential
    confusion about which Sisinnius is being referred to, as there may be multiple
    historical figures with that name. Additionally, without specific context or additional
    information, it is unclear which Aldhelm is being referenced, as there could be
    more than one person by that name in history. This lack of specificity in identifying
    the individuals makes the question open to multiple interpretations, which could
    lead to different answers depending on which figures are considered.
  - The question asks whether Sisinnius died later than Aldhelm. This appears to be
    straightforward, comparing the dates of death of two historical figures. However,
    without specific context, the question could be ambiguous if there is uncertainty
    about which individuals named Sisinnius and Aldhelm are being referenced, as there
    might be multiple historical figures with these names. Additionally, if the dates
    of death are not well-documented or are disputed, this could also lead to ambiguity.
    However, assuming the most well-known figures are intended (Pope Sisinnius and
    Saint Aldhelm), the question is clear as there is a factual answer based on historical
    records.
  - The question "Did Sisinnius die later than Aldhelm?" can be classified as AMBIGUOUS
    because it may depend on the specific historical sources or interpretations of
    historical timelines. Sisinnius was a pope who died in 708, and Aldhelm was a
    bishop who died in 709. While the apparent answer based on these dates is "No,"
    historical records from different sources might provide slightly varying dates
    or contexts that could lead to different interpretations. Additionally, the question
    assumes familiarity with these historical figures and precise dates, which may
    not be universally agreed upon or known.
  - The question is asking for a comparison of the death dates of two historical figures,
    Sisinnius and Aldhelm. This question is clear because it seeks a factual answer
    regarding the chronological order of their deaths. There is no ambiguity in the
    phrasing, as it asks directly if one event (Sisinnius's death) occurred later
    than another event (Aldhelm's death). The question assumes that these dates are
    known and can be compared directly, leading to one correct answer.
  - The question asks whether Sisinnius died later than Aldhelm, which seems straightforward
    at first glance. However, without specific dates or additional context about the
    historical figures mentioned, the question could be ambiguous. The question assumes
    the reader has knowledge of both Sisinnius and Aldhelm, including the specific
    dates of their deaths. If multiple individuals with these names existed in history,
    it could lead to different interpretations. Therefore, without additional context
    or clarification about which Sisinnius and Aldhelm the question refers to, it
    can be considered ambiguous.
  - The question asks whether Sisinnius died later than Aldhelm. To answer this, one
    needs to determine the death dates of both Sisinnius and Aldhelm and compare them.
    Sisinnius was a pope who died in 708, and Aldhelm was an Anglo-Saxon bishop who
    died in 709. The question is straightforward and does not admit multiple interpretations;
    it is asking for a comparison of specific historical dates. Therefore, there is
    only one correct answer based on historical records.
  - The question asks whether Sisinnius died later than Aldhelm. To determine the
    clarity of this question, we need to consider the historical context and available
    information. Sisinnius was a Pope who died in 708 AD, and Aldhelm was an Anglo-Saxon
    bishop who died in 709 AD. The question seems to have a straightforward interpretation,
    asking for a comparison of the years of death for these two historical figures.
    Given that their years of death are well-documented, the question admits only
    one interpretation and one correct answer. Therefore, the question is clear in
    its intent and can be answered definitively based on historical records.
  - The question asks if Sisinnius died later than Aldhelm. This question could be
    considered ambiguous because it requires specific historical knowledge about the
    death dates of Sisinnius and Aldhelm. Without specifying which Sisinnius is being
    referred to (as there have been multiple historical figures with that name), the
    question could be interpreted in different ways, leading to different answers

  - The question asks about the relative death dates of two historical figures, William
    Warham and Adam Grevenstein. The question is potentially ambiguous because it
    assumes the reader knows who Adam Grevenstein is, but he is not a well-known historical
    figure, and there might be multiple individuals with that name. Additionally,
    without specific dates or additional context, it's unclear if the question refers
    to a particular Adam Grevenstein. Therefore, the question could lead to different
    answers depending on the interpretation of who Adam Grevenstein is.
  - 'The question "Did William Warham die later than Adam Grevenstein?" is asking
    for a comparison of the death dates of two historical figures: William Warham
    and Adam Grevenstein. For William Warham, who was an Archbishop of Canterbury,
    there is a clear historical record of his death date, which is 1532. However,
    Adam Grevenstein is not a widely recognized historical figure, and there is no
    readily available information about his life or death in common historical references.
    This lack of information about Adam Grevenstein makes the question ambiguous,
    as it is unclear who Adam Grevenstein is or when he died. Thus, the question could
    lead to different interpretations depending on one''s knowledge or assumption
    about Adam Grevenstein''s identity and death date.'
  - The question involves comparing the death dates of two historical figures, William
    Warham and Adam Grevenstein. For the question to be classified as CLEAR, both
    individuals must be well-documented historical figures with clearly established
    death dates. William Warham, an Archbishop of Canterbury, died in 1532. However,
    Adam Grevenstein is not a widely recognized historical figure, and without a specific
    reference to his identity or established death date, the question admits more
    than one interpretation. This lack of clarity around Adam Grevenstein's identity
    and death date makes the question ambiguous, as it could lead to different answers
    depending on who is identified as Adam Grevenstein.
  - The question asks whether William Warham died later than Adam Grevenstein, which
    seems straightforward at first glance. However, the question is ambiguous due
    to the lack of widely available information about "Adam Grevenstein." While William
    Warham is a well-documented historical figure who died in 1532, Adam Grevenstein
    does not appear to be a commonly recognized historical figure, and no widely known
    records or dates of his death are available. This lack of clarity about who Adam
    Grevenstein is or when he died makes the question ambiguous, as it cannot be definitively
    answered without additional context or information about Adam Grevenstein.

    of the death dates of two historical figures, Sun Bin and Peithon. This question
    may seem straightforward, but it is actually ambiguous for a couple of reasons.
    Firstly, the exact death dates of both Sun Bin and Peithon are not definitively
    known, with historical records providing limited and sometimes conflicting information.
    Secondly, there might be different interpretations based on which historical sources
    one considers authoritative, as the records from that period are often incomplete
    or inconsistent. Therefore, the ambiguity arises from the lack of precise historical
    data, making it impossible to provide a single, definitive answer to the question.
  - The question asks whether Sun Bin died later than Peithon. This question is ambiguous
    because the historical records regarding the exact dates of death for both Sun
    Bin and Peithon are not precise or universally agreed upon. Sun Bin was a military
    strategist from the Warring States period in China, and Peithon was a Macedonian
    officer under Alexander the Great. The lack of precise historical records for
    their death dates leads to ambiguity in answering this question, as interpretations
    could vary depending on the sources referenced.
  - 'The question asks whether Sun Bin died later than Peithon, comparing the death
    dates of two historical figures. To answer the question accurately, one must know
    the death dates of both individuals. Sun Bin was a military strategist in China
    during the Warring States period, and Peithon was a Macedonian officer and satrap
    who lived around the time of Alexander the Great. The historical records of their
    death dates might be unclear or disputed, but the question itself is straightforward
    in its request for a comparison of two specific events: the deaths of Sun Bin
    and Peithon. Thus, the question does not admit more than one interpretation and
    seeks a singular factual answer.'
  - The question "Did Sun Bin die later than Peithon?" involves comparing the death
    dates of two historical figures, Sun Bin and Peithon. Sun Bin was a military strategist
    in ancient China, and Peithon was a Macedonian officer under Alexander the Great.
    The question is clear in its intent to compare the timing of their deaths. However,
    the ambiguity arises from the historical records themselves. The exact dates of
    Sun Bin's death are not well-documented and are subject to historical debate,
    as are the exact details regarding Peithon's death. This lack of precise historical
    data introduces ambiguity into the question, as different sources may provide
    different interpretations of their respective death dates.
  - The question asks whether Sun Bin died later than Peithon. This question could
    be considered ambiguous because it involves historical figures from different
    cultures and time periods, and there may be uncertainties or variations in historical
    records regarding their exact dates of death. Without clear and universally agreed-upon
    dates for both individuals' deaths, the question could lead to different interpretations
    and answers based on differing historical sources or scholarly opinions.
  - The question asks whether Sun Bin died later than Peithon. This question is ambiguous
    because it depends on the specific historical figures being referenced, and there
    are potential uncertainties in historical records. Sun Bin was a military strategist
    in ancient China, traditionally believed to have lived during the Warring States
    period, but the exact dates of his life are not well-documented. Peithon was a
    Macedonian officer under Alexander the Great, and his death is recorded to have
    occurred in 316 BC. Without precise and universally accepted dates for Sun Bin's
    death, the question could be interpreted differently, leading to different answers
    based on different historical sources or assumptions.
  - 'The question asks whether Sun Bin died later than Peithon. To answer this, we
    need specific historical data: the death dates of Sun Bin and Peithon. However,
    historical records about these figures are not precise. Sun Bin was a military
    strategist during the Warring States period in China, and Peithon was a Macedonian
    general of Alexander the Great. The exact death dates for both figures are not
    definitively recorded in history, which makes it difficult to provide a clear
    answer. Additionally, without precise dates, the question can be interpreted in
    different ways depending on the historical sources one considers, leading to potential
    discrepancies in the answer.'
  - 'The question asks whether Sun Bin died later than Peithon. This requires comparing
    the death dates of two historical figures: Sun Bin, a Chinese military strategist,
    and Peithon, a Macedonian officer. The question is clear in its intent, as it
    asks for a chronological comparison based on historical dates. Assuming the dates
    are known and uncontested, there is one interpretation and one correct answer.
    However, historical records can sometimes be incomplete or disputed, but the question
    itself is not ambiguous as it is asking for a direct comparison of their death
    dates.'
  - 'The question asks about the relative timing of the deaths of two historical figures:
    Sun Bin and Peithon. This question could be considered AMBIGUOUS because it relies
    on historical records that may not be precise or universally agreed upon. Sun
    Bin was a military strategist from the Warring States period of China, and historical
    records about his life are limited. Peithon was a Macedonian officer and satrap
    who lived in the era following Alexander the Great. The exact years of their deaths
    may not be clearly documented or may vary according to different historical sources.
    Therefore, the question could lead to different interpretations depending on the
    sources referenced.'
