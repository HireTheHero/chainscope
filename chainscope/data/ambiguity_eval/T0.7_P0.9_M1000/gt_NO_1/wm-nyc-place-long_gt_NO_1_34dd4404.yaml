  - The question asks whether Stuyvesant Town is located east of Kips Bay Towers South
    Building in Manhattan. The question provides specific addresses for Stuyvesant
    Town, which should allow for a clear geographical determination. The only interpretation
    needed is whether one location is east of the other, which is a straightforward
    geographical query. As long as the addresses and location names are correct, this
    question should have one correct answer based on their respective positions on
    a map.
  - The question asks whether Stuyvesant Town, located at specific addresses on E
    20th Street, is east of Kips Bay Towers South Building in Manhattan. This requires
    a geographical comparison of two specific locations in Manhattan. The question
    is straightforward in that it asks for a directional relationship (east of) between
    two well-defined locations. Thus, it admits only one interpretation and one correct
    answer based on geographical data.
  - The question asks whether a specific location, Stuyvesant Town at 622 E 20 624
    E 20 626 E 20 628 E 20 in Manhattan, is located east of another location, Kips
    Bay Towers South Building in Manhattan. This question seems to require a geographical
    comparison based on their positions on a map. However, the question could be considered
    ambiguous because it does not specify the exact addresses for Kips Bay Towers
    South Building, and it assumes the reader knows or has access to the precise geographical
    locations of these places. Additionally, the phrasing and format of the addresses
    for Stuyvesant Town could lead to confusion, as it's unclear if these are multiple
    addresses or a range of addresses. Therefore, due to potential variations in interpretation
    regarding the exact locations being compared, the question can be classified as
    ambiguous.

    addresses, is located east of another specific location, Kips Bay Towers South
    Building, both in Manhattan. The question provides specific addresses for Stuyvesant
    Town, which can be cross-referenced with the location of Kips Bay Towers to determine
    their relative positions. There is no ambiguity in what is being asked, as it
    involves geographic locations that can be precisely identified and compared. Therefore,
    the question admits only one interpretation and one correct answer based on geographic
    data.
  - 'The question asks whether Stuyvesant Town, specified by several addresses on
    East 20th Street, is located east of the Kips Bay Towers South Building in Manhattan.
    The question appears to have a specific geographical inquiry about the relative
    locations of two places in Manhattan. However, it is ambiguous because:

    1. It lists several addresses for Stuyvesant Town without clarifying if the entire
    area or a specific address is being compared.

    2. It does not specify which address of Stuyvesant Town to consider when determining
    its position relative to the Kips Bay Towers South Building.

    3. The question does not provide the exact address of the Kips Bay Towers South
    Building, leading to potential confusion if it spans multiple locations.


    Due to these ambiguities, the question could be interpreted in multiple ways,
    potentially leading to different answers based on the addresses considered. Therefore,
    it is classified as ambiguous.'
  - 'The question asks if a specific location in Manhattan (Stuyvesant Town) is located
    east of another specific location (Kips Bay Towers South Building) within the
    same borough. The question is specific in terms of the locations mentioned, and

    the way the location is described: "STUYVESANT TOWN 622 E 20 624 E 20 626 E 20
    628 E 20" could refer to multiple addresses or a range of addresses, and it''s
    not clear if it refers to a specific building or area. Additionally, without specific
    coordinates or a clear understanding of how these addresses are grouped, interpretations
    may vary. Therefore, while the question seems straightforward, the description
    of the locations introduces ambiguity.'

  - The question asks whether Cedar Grove Cemetery in Queens is located east of Pumpkin
    Patch Marsh in Queens. This question can be classified as AMBIGUOUS because it
    involves geographic locations that may not be well-known or easily verifiable
    without specific geographic data or maps. The ambiguity arises from potential
    variations in the names or locations of these places, as well as the lack of clear,
    universally accepted geographic boundaries or reference points to determine what
    constitutes "east" of one location relative to another. Without precise coordinates
    or a reliable map, different interpretations could lead to different answers.
  - 'The question asks about the geographical relationship between two specific locations
    in Queens, New York City: Cedar Grove Cemetery and Pumpkin Patch Marsh. The question
    is clear in its intent, seeking to determine whether one location (Cedar Grove

    a straightforward inquiry into spatial orientation that admits only one interpretation
    and can be answered definitively with geographical data or a map.'
  - 'The question asks about the geographical relationship between two specific locations
    in Queens, NYC: Cedar Grove Cemetery and Pumpkin Patch Marsh. It seeks to determine
    if Cedar Grove Cemetery is located east of Pumpkin Patch Marsh. The question is
    clear and specific, with only one interpretation: the relative eastward position
    of the cemetery compared to the marsh. There are no ambiguous terms or multiple
    interpretations in the context of the question; it is a straightforward inquiry
    about spatial orientation.'
  - The question asks whether Cedar Grove Cemetery in Queens is located east of Pumpkin
    Patch Marsh in Queens. The clarity of this question hinges on the availability
    and accuracy of geographic data regarding the locations of these two places. The

  - 'The question asks about the geographical relationship between two specific locations
    in Queens, New York City: Cedar Grove Cemetery and Pumpkin Patch Marsh. This is
    a straightforward request for spatial information, which can be answered by consulting
    a map or geographic data. There is only one correct answer based on their actual
    locations. Therefore, the question does not admit multiple interpretations or
    answers.'
  - The question asks whether Cedar Grove Cemetery in Queens is located east of Pumpkin
    Patch Marsh in Queens. The question assumes a specific understanding of the geographic
    locations of both Cedar Grove Cemetery and Pumpkin Patch Marsh. However, the question
    could be considered ambiguous if there is more than one Cedar Grove Cemetery or
    Pumpkin Patch Marsh in Queens, or if the boundaries of these places are not clearly
    defined. Additionally, without specific geographic coordinates or maps, different
    interpretations of "east" could lead to different answers. Thus, the question
    could be interpreted in multiple ways based on these factors.
  - The question is asking about the geographical location of Cedar Grove Cemetery
    in relation to Pumpkin Patch Marsh, both of which are in Queens, NYC. This question
    hinges on spatial geography, which should have a definitive answer based on maps
    or geographical data. Therefore, it admits only one interpretation and one correct
    answer based on objective location data.
  - The question asks about the relative location of Cedar Grove Cemetery and Pumpkin
    Patch Marsh in Queens, NYC. The question is specific about the two places and
    asks for a directional relationship (whether one is east of the other). Assuming
    both locations are correctly identified and exist, the question is clear in its
    intent to find out the directional relationship between the two. Therefore, it
    admits one interpretation and one correct answer based on geographical data.
  - The question asks about the relative location of Cedar Grove Cemetery in Queens,
    New York, in relation to Pumpkin Patch Marsh in Queens. To determine if the question
    is clear or ambiguous, we need to consider if there is only one interpretation
    of the locations involved. If Cedar Grove Cemetery and Pumpkin Patch Marsh are
    well-defined locations with fixed coordinates, then the question admits a single
    interpretation and can be answered with a definitive "yes" or "no" based on geographical
    data. However, if there is any ambiguity in the names, such as multiple locations
    with similar names or unclear boundaries, then the question would be ambiguous.
    Assuming the locations are clearly defined and there is no confusion about their
    names or boundaries, the question is clear.

  - 'The question is asking whether one school, PS 527 East Side School for Social
    Action in Manhattan, is located east of another school, Brooklyn Charter School
    in Brooklyn. The interpretation hinges on geographic locations, and there is a
    specific direction (east) mentioned. The locations of these schools can be determined
    using a map, and the question only has one geographic interpretation: the relative
    east-west positioning of two fixed locations. Therefore, the question is clear
    and admits only one correct answer based on geographic data.'
  - The question asks whether PS 527 EAST SIDE SCHOOL FOR SOCIAL ACTION in Manhattan
    is located east of BROOKLYN CHARTER SCHOOL in Brooklyn. The interpretation of
    "east of" is straightforward in terms of geographical direction. However, the
    question does not specify how "east" is being measured (e.g., by longitudinal
    lines, street alignment, or another method), and because Manhattan and Brooklyn
    are boroughs of New York City that are not aligned directly north-south or east-west,
    there could be multiple interpretations of what "east of" means in this context.
    Therefore, the question can lead to different answers based on the interpretation
    of "east of." Additionally, without specific address details or a defined method
    of measurement, determining the exact east-west positioning is not possible with
    the information provided.
  - 'The question is asking whether one school in Manhattan is located east of another
    school in Brooklyn. Since Manhattan and Brooklyn are two separate boroughs in
    New York City, with Brooklyn generally located to the south and east of Manhattan,
    the question is logically clear. The interpretation is straightforward: determine
    the relative east-west positioning of the two schools based on their geographic
    locations. There is only one correct interpretation and answer to this question.'
  - The question asks whether PS 527 EAST SIDE SCHOOL FOR SOCIAL ACTION in Manhattan
    is located east of BROOKLYN CHARTER SCHOOL in Brooklyn. It seems to be seeking
    a geographical comparison between two specific locations. However, the question
    is ambiguous because it involves comparing the relative positions of two schools
    located in different boroughs. The phrase "located east of" could be interpreted
    in various ways depending on specific points within each borough, and without
    precise coordinates or a clear definition of "east" in this context, the interpretation
    could vary. Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation regarding
    how to determine "east" across separate boroughs.
  - The question asks whether PS 527 EAST SIDE SCHOOL FOR SOCIAL ACTION in Manhattan
    is located east of BROOKLYN CHARTER SCHOOL in Brooklyn. This question involves
    geographical locations, which are typically fixed and can be objectively determined.
    Given the nature of New York City's layout, Manhattan is generally west of Brooklyn,
    making the question clear in terms of interpretation and answer. There is one
    interpretation regarding the relative east-west positioning of the two schools.
  - 'The question asks if one school in Manhattan is located east of another school
    in Brooklyn. Geographically, Brooklyn is generally to the south and slightly east
    of Manhattan. However, because the question involves specific schools, the interpretation
    depends on the precise locations of these two schools. Given that the question
    is specific about the schools and their boroughs, it implies a straightforward
    geographical inquiry about their relative positions on a map. There is only one
    geographical interpretation: determining the relative east-west positions of the
    two schools. Therefore, the question is clear in its request for a simple directional
    comparison based on geography.'
  - The question asks if one location (PS 527 EAST SIDE SCHOOL FOR SOCIAL ACTION,
    Manhattan) is located east of another location (BROOKLYN CHARTER SCHOOL, Brooklyn).
    The question is straightforward in asking for a comparison of the eastward location
    of two specific places. However, there is an inherent ambiguity because the locations
    are in different boroughs (Manhattan and Brooklyn), making a direct east-west
    comparison not entirely straightforward without a clear reference point or method
    for comparison. The question lacks specificity in terms of how to measure "east
    of" across boroughs, which can be interpreted differently depending on how one
    defines "east" in the context of NYC geography.
  - The question asks whether PS 527 EAST SIDE SCHOOL FOR SOCIAL ACTION, located in
    Manhattan, is east of BROOKLYN CHARTER SCHOOL, located in Brooklyn. The question
    can be interpreted in multiple ways due to the geographic scope involved. Firstly,
    "east of" could refer to a longitudinal comparison between the specific locations
    of the two schools, which requires precise geographic coordinates. Secondly, the
    question involves locations in two different boroughs, which could imply a broader,
    less precise interpretation of "east." Additionally, the question involves specific
    knowledge of the schools' exact locations, which could lead to different interpretations
    based on varying familiarity with NYC's geography. Therefore, due to these potential
    ambiguities in interpretation, the question is classified as ambiguous.
  - The question asks about the relative location of two schools, one in Manhattan
    and the other in Brooklyn, within New York City. The question is ambiguous because
    it is not clear what is meant by "east of" in this context, given that Manhattan
    and Brooklyn are separate boroughs with their own distinct layouts and orientations.
    Additionally, the term "east of" could be interpreted in various ways depending
    on the specific points of reference used within each borough, leading to different
    answers.
  - The question is asking whether a specific school in Manhattan (PS 527 East Side
    School for Social Action) is located east of another school in Brooklyn (Brooklyn
    Charter School). Since it involves geographic locations, there is a clear interpretation
    based on their respective positions on a map. However, the question could be considered
    slightly ambiguous if one were to interpret "east of" in a broader or non-literal
    context (e.g., considering boroughs' general orientations or other factors), but
    given the context of specific schools and locations, the interpretation is primarily
    geographic. Therefore, the question is more clear than ambiguous, as it seeks
    a straightforward comparison of locations on a map.

    It specifies two locations and asks if one is east of the other. While geographic
    questions may sometimes seem straightforward, this particular question can be
    ambiguous due to the following reasons:


    1. The term "east" can be subject to interpretation based on the point of reference
    or the specific method of determining east-west orientation (e.g., using a map,
    GPS coordinates, or a particular projection).

    2. The names provided ("MARITIME COLLEGE REINHART FIELD" and "JAMAICA EVENING
    HIGH SCHOOL M") might not correspond to unique or widely recognized locations,
    making it difficult to determine their exact coordinates without further context.

    3. The use of "located east of" implies a direct linear comparison, which can
    be problematic if either location is not well-defined or if there are multiple
    possible interpretations of what constitutes "east" on a map that accounts for
    the curvature of the Earth.

    comparing two locations in different boroughs (Bronx and Brooklyn) of New York
    City. Since both the Bronx and Brooklyn are quite large and not directly adjacent
    to each other, determining whether one specific location in one borough is east
    or west of a specific location in another borough can be interpreted in different
    ways. The question could be interpreted as asking about their relative positions
    on a map of New York City, but without clear boundaries or additional context,

    actual locations. Therefore, the question does not admit multiple interpretations
    regarding what is being asked.
  - The question asks if a specific location in the Bronx is east of another location
    in Brooklyn. However, this presents an issue because the Bronx and Brooklyn are
    two different boroughs of New York City, and it is geographically impossible for
    a location in the Bronx to be east of a location in Brooklyn given their relative
    positions. Therefore, the question is based on a geographical misunderstanding,
    leading to ambiguity in how to interpret "east of" in this context, as it doesn't
    make logical sense with the given locations.

  - The question asks whether Yankee Stadium in the Bronx is located east of the High
    School for Health Careers and Sciences in Manhattan. The question is specific
    about the locations being compared, and the terms "east" and "located" are generally
    understood in a geographic context. However, the question is ambiguous because
    it does not specify the reference point from which "east" is being measured. Since
    the terms "east" and "west" can vary depending on the specific lines of longitude
    used as a reference, this can lead to different interpretations of the question.
    Therefore, the question could lead to different answers based on the interpretation
    of the reference points used for determining "east."

  - The question asks about the relative geographical location of two specific buildings
    within the Smith Houses complex in Manhattan. The interpretation hinges on the
    physical layout of these buildings. If the layout and numbering of the buildings
    are standardized and publicly documented, then the question would be clear as
    there would be one correct answer based on their actual geographical positions.
    However, if the numbering or layout isn't standardized or publicly known, it could
    lead to multiple interpretations based on different sources or maps. Without explicit
    information on the layout, the question could be seen as ambiguous. Given that
    the relative positions of buildings might not be common knowledge, and without
    a specific map or authoritative source to refer to, this question could be interpreted
    in more than one way.
  - The question asks for the relative location of two specific buildings within the
