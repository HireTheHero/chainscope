    80218, both of which are in Colorado. Zip codes are numerical codes used for mail
    delivery and do not inherently convey geographic information such as east or west.
    However, zip codes can often be mapped to geographic locations. The question implies
    a geographic comparison based on the zip codes, which is a clear request for spatial
    orientation. Given that zip codes can be mapped to specific locations, the question
    is asking for a straightforward geographic comparison between two points that
    can be determined. Therefore, the question only admits one interpretation: determining
    the relative east-west position of two specific geographic locations identified
    by their zip codes. Thus, the question is clear.'
  - The question asks whether the location of one zip code (80203) in Colorado is
    east of another zip code (80218) in Colorado. The question is looking for a spatial
    relationship between two specific zip codes. While zip codes can generally be
    located using geographic information, their boundaries may not align neatly in
    a strictly east-west direction due to the irregularity of zip code areas. Additionally,
    without specific coordinates or a map reference, determining the relative east-west
    position may not be straightforward. However, the question itself is asking for
    a specific relationship based on a set criterion (east or west), which suggests
    it is looking for a factual, singular answer based on geographic data.
  - The question asks whether one zip code (80203) is located east of another zip
    code (80218) within the same state (Colorado). The interpretation hinges on the
    geographical locations of these zip codes relative to each other. Zip codes are
    numerical representations and do not inherently convey geographical direction
    such as east or west. However, they are often assigned in a way that follows a
    general geographic pattern. In this case, both zip codes are in Denver, Colorado,
    and determining which is east of the other requires specific knowledge of their
    geographical boundaries. The question assumes a straightforward east-west comparison
    based on zip code numbers, which does not inherently provide a clear directional
    answer without additional geographic information. Thus, the question could be
    interpreted in more than one way based on available data or assumptions about
    how zip codes correlate with geographic positioning.
  - The question involves determining the geographical location of two specific US
    zip codes, 80203 and 80218, in Colorado. The question is asking if one zip code
    is located east of the other. This requires a straightforward comparison of the
    longitude of the two zip codes. Since each zip code corresponds to a specific
    area, and longitude can be used to determine if one location is east or west of
    another, there is only one correct interpretation and answer to this question.
  - The question is asking about the geographical locations of two specific zip codes
    in Colorado, 80203 and 80218, and whether one is east of the other. Zip codes
    can be mapped to specific geographic areas, allowing for a determination of their
    relative positions. However, without additional context or a specific source for
    determining the precise boundaries of these zip codes, there could be ambiguity
    in interpretation. For example, if the zip code areas overlap or if they are adjacent
    but not aligned strictly east-west, the answer could vary based on interpretation.
    Thus, while there is a factual basis to answer the question, the lack of precise
    mapping information in the question itself makes it potentially open to different
    answers depending on the source or method used to determine the locations.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 80203 in Colorado is located east of the
    zip code 80218 in Colorado. This question is ambiguous because zip codes are not
    necessarily laid out in a simple east-west or north-south pattern. The spatial
    relationship between two zip codes cannot be determined solely based on their
    numerical order, as zip codes are assigned based on various logistical and geographical
    factors. Additionally, the question does not specify the basis or method for determining
    "east" (e.g., geographic center of each zip code, specific points within each
    zip code, etc.). Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation,
    which could lead to different answers depending on the method used to determine
    "east."
  - The question is asking whether one US zip code (80203) in Colorado is located
    east of another zip code (80218) in Colorado. The question is clear in its intent,
    as it specifically asks for the relative east-west location of two given zip codes
    within the same state. The interpretation involves checking the geographical positioning
    of these zip codes. There is only one correct answer based on the actual geographical
    data of these zip codes.
  - The question asks whether one specific zip code (80203, CO) is located east of
    another specific zip code (80218, CO). While this might seem straightforward,
    the interpretation of "east" can be ambiguous in the context of zip codes. Zip
    codes are not strictly geographical coordinates and can have irregular shapes,
    meaning one zip code could extend further east in some parts than another, even
    if generally positioned more to the west. Additionally, without specific geographical
    data or mapping, it is not possible to definitively determine the relative east-west
    position of two zip codes based solely on their numbers. Therefore, the question
    can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on how one assesses the "east" position
    of the zip codes, leading to potentially different answers.
  - The question is asking whether the zip code 80203 is located east of zip code
    80218, both of which are in Colorado. The question assumes a geographical interpretation
    based on the relative location of these two zip codes. However, determining the
    "east" location depends on specific mapping data, which can provide a definitive
    answer about their relative positions. There is only one way to interpret this
    question in terms of geographic location, making it clear in its intent and scope.
  - 'The question asks about the relative location of two specific zip codes in Colorado:
    80203 and 80218. Zip codes are numerical and based on a geographical area, which
    allows for a straightforward comparison of their locations. Since the question
    specifies "east of," it only admits one interpretation: determining the longitudinal
    relationship between the two zip codes. This can be resolved with a simple geographical
    lookup to determine the relative positions of the two zip codes. Therefore, the
    question is clear in its intent and requires a factual answer based on geographic

  - The question involves determining the geographical location of two zip codes to
    ascertain if one is east of the other. The question appears clear in that it asks
    for a directional relationship between two specific locations identified by their
    zip codes. However, it is somewhat ambiguous because zip codes do not inherently
    convey directional information, and one would need to look up the locations to
    determine the answer. Additionally, the structure of the question could imply
    an inquiry into whether the entire area of one zip code is east of the entire
    area of another, or just a specific point within each zip code. This potential
    variation in interpretation adds an element of ambiguity.
  - 'The question is asking if one location (24151, VA) is east of another location
    (15104, PA) using their respective zip codes. However, zip codes are not inherently
    geographical coordinates, and the numeric values of zip codes do not correspond
    to geographical directions or positions. Therefore, the question could be interpreted
    in a couple of ways: whether the zip code number itself is greater or lesser (which
    does not correspond to east/west location), or whether the geographical location
    associated with the zip code is east or west of the other. Since zip code numbers
    are not a reliable indicator of geographic location, and without additional context
    on how zip codes relate to geographic positioning, the question admits multiple
    interpretations regarding how to determine "east" or "west." Thus, it is ambiguous.'
  - The question is asking about the geographical location of two US zip codes, specifically
    whether the zip code 24151 in Virginia (VA) is located east of the zip code 15104
    in Pennsylvania (PA). On the surface, the question seems to be straightforward
    as it involves comparing the longitudinal positions of two places. However, the
    use of zip codes for geographical positioning is inherently ambiguous. Zip codes
    are primarily used for postal purposes and do not always correspond to a clear
    or consistent geographical area. Additionally, the question could be interpreted
    as asking for the relative longitudinal position of the central point of these
    zip codes, but without specifying how the location of a zip code is determined
    (e.g., centroid, boundary, etc.), there could be different interpretations. Therefore,
    the question can lead to different answers depending on how one interprets the
    geographical positioning of the zip codes.
  - The question is ambiguous because it compares two zip codes, 24151 in Virginia
    and 15104 in Pennsylvania, in terms of their geographic location relative to each
    other. However, zip codes are not inherently geographic coordinates; they are
    postal codes, which may not correspond directly to precise longitudinal comparisons.
    Additionally, the question doesn't specify whether it refers to the general area
    covered by the zip codes or a specific point within them, leading to multiple
    interpretations.
  - The question asks if the location of the zip code 24151 in Virginia is east of
    the location of the zip code 15104 in Pennsylvania. This involves geographic knowledge
    of the locations of these zip codes. The question is straightforward in its request
    for a comparison of the geographic positions of two specific zip codes and does
    not present multiple interpretations. The answer relies on the specific geographic
    data of these zip codes, which should yield a single correct answer regarding
    their relative positions. Therefore, the question is clear in its intent and scope.
  - The question is asking whether the location associated with the zip code 24151
    in Virginia is east of the location associated with the zip code 15104 in Pennsylvania.
    The question might seem straightforward, but it is ambiguous because zip codes
    are not inherently geographical coordinates or directional indicators. Zip codes
    are primarily used for postal purposes and do not provide explicit information
    about geographical orientation such as "east" or "west." Therefore, while one
    could look up the geographical locations of these zip codes and determine their
    relative positions, the question itself does not provide enough context to be
    interpreted in only one way without additional assumptions or information about
    how zip codes relate to geography.
  - 'The question involves determining the geographic location of two zip codes: 24151
    in Virginia and 15104 in Pennsylvania. The ambiguity arises from the way zip codes
    are structured. Zip codes are numerical codes used by postal services to identify
    specific regions. However, they do not inherently provide geographic information
    about whether one location is east or west of another. The question could be interpreted
    as asking about the geographic coordinates or the numeric order of the zip codes,
    leading to different interpretations and answers. Therefore, the question is ambiguous.'
  - The question asks whether the location of the zip code 24151 in Virginia is east
    of the zip code 15104 in Pennsylvania. However, zip codes are not inherently geographical
    coordinates, and comparing them in terms of east or west does not directly relate
    to their numerical values. Additionally, the question could be interpreted as
    asking about the relative positions of these locations on a map, which requires
    geographical knowledge or tools to determine, rather than just comparing numbers.
    This leads to potential ambiguity in the interpretation of "located east of" based
    on numerical zip code values versus actual geographical locations.
  - 'The question asks if one location, identified by a zip code in Virginia (24151),
    is located east of another location identified by a zip code in Pennsylvania (15104).
    While the question provides specific zip codes and states, it can be interpreted
    in two ways: as a question about geographic longitude or as a question about postal
    sorting order. The interpretation regarding geographic longitude would involve
    determining the relative positions of the two zip code areas on a map, whereas
    the postal sorting order interpretation would involve examining how zip codes
    are numerically organized. These interpretations could lead to different answers,
    making the question ambiguous.'
  - The question asks whether the location corresponding to the zip code 24151 in
    Virginia is east of the location corresponding to the zip code 15104 in Pennsylvania.
    However, zip codes are not inherently geographical coordinates; they are primarily
    used for mail delivery routes and do not follow a linear geographical progression.
    Therefore, comparing them based on their numerical order does not directly relate
    to their geographic positioning. The interpretation of the question could vary
    based on whether the zip codes are considered as geographic markers or as simple
    numeric identifiers. Thus, the question admits more than one interpretation, leading
    to different answers.

  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographical location of two specific
    zip codes: 89509 and 89506, both presumably in Nevada (NV). However, zip codes
    do not always follow a strict geographical order, and their boundaries can be
    irregular. Additionally, the question does not specify whether it is asking about
    the easternmost point, the centroid, or another aspect of the zip codes'' locations.
    This lack of specificity makes the question open to multiple interpretations regarding
    what "located east of" precisely means.'
  - The question is asking if one zip code (89509) is located east of another zip
    code (89506) within the state of Nevada (NV). While zip codes can be used to identify
    general locations, they do not provide precise geographic coordinates that definitively
    establish their relative positions (east, west, etc.). Additionally, zip code
    areas can be non-contiguous or irregularly shaped, further complicating a simple
    east-west comparison based solely on the numbers or state. Hence, the question
    could be interpreted in multiple ways depending on how one determines "east" in
    this context, and without additional geographic information, it could lead to
    different answers.
  - The question is asking about the geographical location of two zip codes in Nevada
    (NV). However, zip codes do not necessarily follow a geographical order or pattern
    that corresponds directly to east-west or north-south directions. Without specific
    geographical data or a map, it is not clear whether zip code 89509 is located
    east of 89506. Therefore, the question could be interpreted in different ways,
    such as asking for a direct comparison based on numerical order, geographical
    data, or another criteria. This makes the question ambiguous because it can lead
    to different interpretations and answers depending on the criteria used.
  - The question is asking whether one specific zip code in Nevada (89509) is located
    east of another zip code in Nevada (89506). Zip codes are often used for mail
    delivery purposes and don't necessarily correlate directly to geographical coordinates.
    Additionally, zip codes can be non-contiguous or organized in a manner that doesn't
    reflect strict geographical east-west relationships. Without specific geographic
    coordinates or a map, the determination of "east" is ambiguous based solely on
    zip code numbers. Thus, the question can admit more than one interpretation based
    on how one defines "east" (e.g., by latitude, by zip code sequence, etc.).
  - The question asks whether the zip code 89509 is located east of the zip code 89506,
    both of which are in Nevada (NV). However, the question assumes knowledge of the
    geographical locations associated with these zip codes. Without specific coordinates
    or a map, it is not possible to determine their relative east-west positioning.
    Additionally, zip codes are not strictly geographical; they are postal codes,
    which can lead to non-intuitive spatial relationships. Therefore, the question
    is ambiguous because it requires external information not provided within the
    question itself.
  - The question is asking about the relative location of two zip codes, 89509 and
    89506, both stated to be in Nevada (NV). However, there is an ambiguity because
    89509 is actually located in Reno, NV, while 89506 is also in Reno, NV, but the
    question implies a comparison of locations as if they were in different areas.
    The interpretation of "east" could be relative to specific points within Reno,
    which could lead to different answers depending on the exact locations being compared.
    Additionally, without specific geographic coordinates or a clear reference point,
    the question could be interpreted in multiple ways.
  - The question is asking whether the zip code 89509 is located east of the zip code
    89506, both within the state of Nevada (NV). The zip codes are specific and refer
    to particular geographical areas. However, the question could be ambiguous if
    there is any confusion about whether the numbers alone determine east or west
    orientation without a map reference, as zip codes are not always sequentially
    aligned geographically. However, assuming the question is intended to be about
    the actual geographical locations of the zip codes, it is clear as it seeks a
    factual answer based on the geographical position of these specific zip codes.
  - The question asks if the zip code 89509, NV is located east of 89506, NV. However,
    zip codes are not strictly geographical in terms of cardinal directions and can
    be non-contiguous or not follow a straightforward east-west or north-south orientation.
    Additionally, the question does not specify what type of "east" is being referred
    to, such as within the state or on a broader scale. This ambiguity in the geographic
    interpretation of zip codes and the lack of context about the scale or reference
    point for "east" leads to potential multiple interpretations.
  - The question asks whether zip code 89509, which is stated to be in Nevada (NV),
    is located east of zip code 89506, also in Nevada. The question is specific in
    comparing the geographical locations of two zip codes within the same state, implying
    a single interpretation of checking their relative positions on a map. There is
    one correct answer based on the geographical data of these zip codes.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 89509, NV is located east of the zip code
    89506, NV. The interpretation of the question hinges on the geographical locations
    of these two zip codes. Zip codes are specific and uniquely tied to geographical
    areas, which means there is a factual answer based on the geographic coordinates
    of each zip code. Therefore, this question admits one interpretation based on
    geographic facts and has a definitive answer.

    regarding the positions of these zip codes.
  - The question is asking whether a specific zip code (97223, OR) is located east
    of another zip code (98349, WA). While the question seems straightforward, it
    is actually ambiguous due to several factors. Firstly, zip codes are not inherently
    geographical coordinates and can sometimes span across a wide area or have irregular
    shapes, making it difficult to determine their relative positions based solely
    on the zip code numbers. Additionally, the question does not specify which part
    of the zip code area should be considered for determining the east-west relationship.
    Therefore, the interpretation of the question could vary depending on how one
    defines the location of a zip code. As such, the question admits more than one
    interpretation, which could lead to different answers.
  - The question asks whether the zip code 97223, which is in Oregon, is located east

    is only one correct interpretation: determining the geographical position of these
    zip codes relative to each other. This can be resolved using a map or geographic
    data, making the question clear and admitting only one correct answer.'
  - The question asks whether the zip code 52328 is located east of the zip code 52402,
    both within Iowa. While zip codes can give a general idea of location, they are
    not specifically designed to determine geographical orientation such as east or
    west. The primary purpose of zip codes is to facilitate mail delivery, not to
    reflect precise geographic positions. Additionally, without specific geographical
    knowledge or a map, determining the relative east-west positioning of these zip
    codes can be difficult. However, if we assume the question is about their general
    geographic location in relation to each other, it could be interpreted as asking
    for a straightforward comparison based on geographic data. Despite potential challenges
    in interpreting zip code data for geographic positioning, the question itself
    does not present multiple interpretations regarding what is being asked. Therefore,
    it is a matter of verifying geographic information rather than interpreting the
    question in multiple ways.
  - The question asks whether one location in Iowa, identified by its zip code 52328,
    is located east of another location in Iowa, identified by zip code 52402. Zip
    codes are numerical representations used for mail delivery purposes and do not
    inherently convey geographic information such as cardinal directions. However,
    zip codes in the United States often follow a general pattern where lower numbers
    are found in the east and higher numbers in the west, especially on a national
    level. This pattern is less reliable at a more localized level, such as within
    a single state, where zip code numbers may not correlate directly with geographic
    positioning. Therefore, without additional geographic data or mapping information,
    the question could be interpreted in different ways regarding the locations of
    these zip codes relative to each other. This results in potential ambiguity in
    determining a clear east-west relationship based solely on the zip code numbers.

    is clear and admits one correct answer.
  - The question asks whether the location represented by the zip code 52328 in Iowa
    is east of the location represented by the zip code 52402 in Iowa. Zip codes are
    generally assigned based on postal routes and do not necessarily correlate directly
    with geographic coordinates such as longitude. Therefore, determining whether
    one zip code is geographically east of another requires additional geographic
    information beyond just the zip codes themselves. Without this information, there
    could be multiple interpretations or methods to determine the answer (e.g., by
    looking at a map or by using geographic data), which can lead to different answers
    depending on the source of the data or interpretation method used.

    are often grouped in ways that roughly correspond to geographic regions. However,
    without specific geographic coordinates or a map, the question could be interpreted
    differently depending on how one interprets the relationship between zip codes
    and geography. Therefore, the question could lead to different answers depending
    on the interpretation of how zip codes relate to geographic directionality.
  - The question is asking whether the location of the zip code 52328 in Iowa is east

  - The question is asking whether a location in West Virginia (WV) is east of a location
    in Florida (FL), based on their zip codes. However, zip codes are not typically
    used to determine geographical directions or positions in terms of east and west.
    The question could be interpreted in terms of geographical coordinates, which
    would be clear, but the use of zip codes introduces ambiguity because zip codes
    do not inherently convey geographical directionality. Therefore, the question
    can be seen as ambiguous because it mixes zip code information with a geographical
    direction query, leading to potential confusion about the intended method of determining
    "east" and "west".
  - The question asks whether a specific zip code in West Virginia (25541) is located
    east of a specific zip code in Florida (33563). The interpretation of "east" refers

    correct answer to this question based on geographical data.
  - The question asks whether a specific zip code in Pennsylvania (16651) is located
    east of a specific zip code in New York (14103). Zip codes are primarily used
    for mail delivery and do not correspond directly to geographic coordinates like
    longitude or latitude. Therefore, determining "east" or "west" solely based on
    zip code numbers can be misleading. Additionally, zip codes in different states
    do not follow a contiguous numerical pattern that aligns with geographic orientation.
    Thus, without additional geographic data, the question is open to interpretation
    regarding how one might determine "east" or "west" based on zip codes alone.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographical locations of two zip codes:
    16651 in Pennsylvania and 14103 in New York. This question could be interpreted
    in multiple ways because zip codes do not necessarily follow a strict geographical
    order, and the phrasing "located east of" could refer to longitudinal positioning
    or other forms of eastward measurement. Without a specific reference to what "east
    of" means in this context (e.g., based on longitude, street layout, or another
    metric), the question can lead to different interpretations and answers.'
  - The question asks whether the zip code 16651, which is in Pennsylvania (PA), is
    located east of the zip code 14103, which is in New York (NY). The question is
    geographically oriented and involves comparing the longitudinal positions of two
    specific locations based on their zip codes. Zip codes can be used to determine
    approximate locations, and the concept of "east" refers to the longitudinal direction.
    Since zip codes correspond to specific geographical areas, the question has a
    clear interpretation and can be answered by examining the longitudinal coordinates
    of the two zip codes.
  - The question is asking whether one location (16651, PA) is east of another location

    specifically determining if one location is east of the other. Zip codes are not
    inherently indicative of precise geographic coordinates, and the numbering system
    is not strictly linear in terms of geographic orientation. Therefore, while the
    question seeks a clear geographic comparison, the interpretation relies on understanding
    the actual geographic locations of these zip codes. Without specific map data,
    the question could be seen as ambiguous since zip codes alone do not provide definitive
    information about east-west orientation. However, if one uses a map, the question
    becomes clear, as geographic coordinates can be determined. In this context, the
    question can be answered definitively with additional geographic information.'
  - The question involves comparing the geographic location of two US zip codes to
    determine their relative positions. However, US zip codes are not arranged in
    a geographic order, and zip codes alone do not provide enough information to determine

    a standard US zip code, which adds further ambiguity. Therefore, the question
    is ambiguous as it relies on potentially incorrect assumptions about zip code
    numbers and their geographical implications.

  - 'The question asks about the relative geographical location of two zip codes in
    New Mexico: 87004 and 88063. The question seems clear as it seeks to determine
    whether one zip code is located east of the other. However, without specific geographical
    knowledge or a map, one might not know the answer. Despite this, the question
    itself is straightforward and does not have multiple interpretations. It specifically
    asks about the east-west relationship between two fixed points.'
  - The question is asking if the location of the zip code 87004 in New Mexico is
    east of the location of the zip code 88063 in New Mexico. This question assumes
    that zip codes can be directly compared in terms of their geographical east-west
    orientation, which is not always straightforward. Zip codes are not strictly organized
    in geographical order, and determining whether one is east of another may require
    additional geographical data or mapping. Therefore, without specific geographical
    coordinates or a map, the question could be interpreted in different ways, leading
    to different answers.
  - 'The question is asking whether the location of zip code 87004 in New Mexico is
    east of zip code 88063 in New Mexico. This question is specific and geographical,
    and determining the answer requires knowledge of the geographical positions of

    the relative east-west positions of the two specified zip codes. Thus, it is clear
    and admits one correct answer based on the geographical data.'
  - The question is asking whether one zip code (87004, NM) is located east of another
    zip code (88063, NM). The interpretation of "east" in this context can be based
    on geographical location within New Mexico. Since zip codes are numeric and do
    not inherently convey directional information, determining which is east of the
    other requires geographical knowledge of the locations corresponding to these
    zip codes. Therefore, the question admits only one interpretation and has a clear,
    factual answer based on geography.
  - The question asks whether one zip code in New Mexico (87004) is located east of
    another zip code in New Mexico (88063). While zip codes are generally numerical
    and can be mapped to specific geographic locations, the relationship between zip
    codes and geographic directions is not straightforward because zip codes are not
    always ordered geographically. Therefore, interpreting the relative location (east
    or west) of one zip code compared to another based solely on their numbers can
    be ambiguous. To answer the question accurately, one would need to look up the
    actual geographic coordinates or locations of these zip codes, which implies the
    question relies on external geographic data rather than a direct interpretation
    from the numbers themselves. This makes the question potentially ambiguous as
    it requires interpretation beyond numerical order.
  - The question is asking whether one location is east of another based on their
    zip codes. However, using zip codes to determine geographic location is not straightforward,
    as zip codes are primarily used for mail delivery and do not always follow geographic
    boundaries. Additionally, without specific latitude and longitude coordinates,
    determining the relative east-west position of two zip codes can be ambiguous.
    Therefore, the interpretation of the question relies on an assumption that zip
    codes can be directly compared for east-west positioning, which may not be accurate.
  - The question asks whether the location of one US ZIP code (87004, NM) is east
    of another ZIP code (88063, NM). ZIP codes are specific geographic areas, and
    their relative positions can be determined based on geographic data. This question
    has a specific interpretation regarding the geographical position of these ZIP
    codes, and it can be answered definitively by examining a map or geographic data.
    Therefore, the question admits only one interpretation and one correct answer.
  - The question is asking whether one specific location (87004, NM) is east of another
    location (88063, NM) within the state of New Mexico, based on their zip codes.

    concept. Zip codes can be mapped to specific geographical coordinates, allowing
    for a definitive answer regarding their east-west relationship. There is no ambiguity
    in terms of what is being asked or how to determine the answer, as it solely relies
    on the geographical positions of the given zip codes.
