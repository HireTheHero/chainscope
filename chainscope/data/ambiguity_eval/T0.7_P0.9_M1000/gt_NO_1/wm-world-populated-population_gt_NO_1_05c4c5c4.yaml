  - The question asks for a comparison of the population between Kalahandi district
    and Nizamabad district. However, it does not specify a time frame or the source
    of population data, which could vary over time and based on different statistical
    reports. Additionally, the question assumes the reader has access to the latest
    or most relevant data to make this comparison, which may not be the case. This
    lack of specificity can lead to multiple interpretations regarding the time or
    source of population data used for comparison.
  - The question asks for a comparison of the population sizes between Kalahandi district
    and Nizamabad district. This is a factual question that can be answered by looking
    up the most recent population data for each district. The question does not present

    district and Nizamabad district. The intent is straightforward, seeking a direct
    comparison based on a specific metric: population. However, the question does
    not specify a time frame or source of data, which could affect the interpretation
    of "more populous," as population figures can change over time and different sources
    might report slightly different numbers. Despite this, the fundamental question
    is clear: it is asking for a comparison of population sizes at a given point in
    time, assuming current or recent data is used.'
  - The question asks whether the Kalahandi district is more populous than the Nizamabad
    district. It is straightforward as it compares the population sizes of two specific

  - The question asks for a comparison of the population sizes between Katni district
    and Vhembe District Municipality. However, the question is ambiguous because it
    does not specify which data or year the population figures should be based on.
    Population numbers can change over time due to various factors like growth, migration,
    and census updates. Without a specified time frame or data source, there could
    be different answers depending on when or where the population data is obtained.
  - 'The question is asking for a comparison of the population sizes of two specific
    regions: Katni district and Vhembe District Municipality. To answer it, one would
    need accurate and current population data for both regions. The question is straightforward
    in its request for a population comparison, and there is no ambiguity in what
    is being asked. It does not admit multiple interpretations; the only requirement
    is to provide the latest population figures for both regions and compare them.'
  - The question asks about the population comparison between Katni district and Vhembe
    District Municipality. While the question is straightforward in its request for
    a population comparison, it could be considered ambiguous due to the lack of a
    specific time frame or source for the population data. Population figures can
    vary over time and depending on the data source, which could lead to different
    answers. However, if we assume the question refers to the most recent and widely
    accepted population data, it could be interpreted as clear. Nevertheless, without
    explicit mention of the data source or time frame, there is inherent ambiguity.
  - The question is asking for a comparison of population between Katni district and
    Vhembe District Municipality. To answer this question, one would need to look
    up the latest population statistics for each region. The question is straightforward
    and does not admit multiple interpretations, as it is clear that the comparison
    is based solely on population numbers.
  - "The question is asking for a comparison between the populations of Katni district\
    \ and Vhembe District Municipality. To determine if it is clear or ambiguous,\
    \ we consider whether there is one definitive way to interpret the question. The\
    \ question specifies two distinct geographical locations and asks for a direct\
    \ comparison in terms of population. There is no ambiguity in terms of what is\
    \ being asked\u2014the population figures for both locations need to be compared.\
    \ However, the answer depends on the most recent and accurate population data\
    \ available, which might vary depending on the source and the year of the data.\
    \ Despite this potential variability in data, the question itself remains clearly\
    \ interpretable as a direct comparison between two specific entities."
  - The question asks for a comparison of the population between Katni district and
    Vhembe District Municipality. The terms "Katni district" and "Vhembe District
    Municipality" are specific geographic regions, and "more populous" refers to a
    clear comparison of their population sizes. However, without specific data provided
    in the question, determining which is more populous requires external information.
    Despite this need for external data, the question itself is clear in its intent
    and meaning. It does not admit multiple interpretations; it simply seeks a factual
    comparison between two specific entities based on population.
  - The question asks for a comparison of the population sizes between Katni district
    and Vhembe District Municipality. This question is specific and requires factual
    data to determine which one is more populous. The question does not present multiple
    interpretations; it is clear in its intent to compare population numbers. Therefore,
    it admits one interpretation and one correct answer based on available data.
  - The question asks whether Katni district is more populous than Vhembe District
    Municipality. While this question appears straightforward, it requires comparing
    population data from two different regions which may not be easily accessible
    or comparable due to potential differences in data collection methods, timeframes,
    or recent population changes. However, the question itself is clearly asking for
    a specific comparison between two distinct entities based on population size,
    which admits only one interpretation and one correct answer based on the most
    current and accurate data.
  - 'The question asks for a comparison of population between two specific places:
    Katni district and Vhembe District Municipality. This is a straightforward request
    for factual information, which can be answered by looking up the population statistics
    for each district. There is only one way to interpret the question, and it seeks
    a specific answer based on available data.'
  - The question asks for a comparison of population between Katni district and Vhembe
    District Municipality. While on the surface, this seems like a straightforward
    comparison, the question is actually ambiguous because it does not specify a particular
    time frame for the population data being compared. Population figures can change
    over time due to growth, migration, and other factors, and without a specified
    year or period, the question could be interpreted in multiple ways, leading to
    different answers depending on the data source or year referenced.

  - "The question asks for a comparison of the populations of two specific places:\
    \ Villa Epecu\xE9n and Antelope Wells, New Mexico. The query is straightforward\
    \ in that it asks whether one place is more populous than the other. However,\
    \ the question becomes ambiguous due to the nature of Villa Epecu\xE9n, which\
    \ was once a thriving town in Argentina but was abandoned after a flood in 1985\
    \ and is now largely uninhabited. Antelope Wells, New Mexico, is a small settlement\
    \ with very few residents, primarily serving as a border crossing. Given that\
    \ Villa Epecu\xE9n is essentially uninhabited, the question could have a simple\
    \ answer, but the historical context and current status of these locations introduce\
    \ ambiguity. The question assumes both places are comparable in terms of current\
    \ population, which is not necessarily valid due to Villa Epecu\xE9n's unique\
    \ history. Thus, the interpretation of \"more populous\" could vary depending\

  - "The question compares the population of two specific places: Villa Epecu\xE9\

  - The question compares the population of Tioga County in New York with Gosen in
    Niigata. To answer it, one would need specific population data for both locations.
    The question is clear in its intent, as it asks for a comparison based on population,
    which is a measurable metric. There is no ambiguity in what is being asked, as
    both locations are specified, and the criterion for comparison (population) is
    straightforward.
  - The question asks for a comparison between the population of Tioga County, New
    York, and Gosen, Niigata. At first glance, it seems straightforward, as it asks
    for a direct comparison. However, the ambiguity arises from the fact that the
    question does not specify the time at which the population data should be considered.
    Population figures can change over time due to various factors such as migration,
    birth rates, and administrative changes. Without a specific time frame or data
    source, the question could lead to different answers depending on when the population
    data is retrieved. Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation
    due to the unspecified temporal context.
  - The question compares the population of Tioga County, New York, with Gosen, Niigata.
    However, there is ambiguity because "Gosen, Niigata" could refer to the city of
    Gosen or the broader area it is located in, which may or may not have different
    population counts. Additionally, without specifying a time frame or the exact
    data source, the population figures could vary, leading to different interpretations
    and answers.
  - The question asks for a comparison of population between Tioga County, New York,
    and Gosen, Niigata. However, the question does not specify which type of population
    measurement to consider (e.g., current population, historical population, population
    density). Additionally, the names "Tioga County" and "Gosen" could potentially
    refer to different entities or locations unless they are clearly defined. Without
    specifying the context or criteria for comparison, the question admits more than
    one interpretation, which could lead to different answers depending on the assumptions
    made about the time frame or specific locations being compared.
  - 'The question asks for a comparison of population sizes between two specific places:
    Tioga County in New York and Gosen in Niigata. The question is straightforward

    based on current population statistics or some other criteria. Additionally, without
    specific data or a timeframe, the question can be interpreted in multiple ways.
  - The question asks for a comparison between the population of Tioga County, New
    York, and Gosen, Niigata. However, it is ambiguous because "Gosen, Niigata" could
    refer to the city itself or the broader region around it. Additionally, population
    figures can change over time, and without a specific time frame, the comparison
    could yield different answers depending on when the data is sourced. Therefore,
    the question can be interpreted in multiple ways, leading to different answers.
  - The question compares the population of Tioga County, New York, to Gosen, Niigata.
    While the question seems straightforward, there are factors that make it ambiguous.
    Firstly, "Gosen" could refer to the city of Gosen in Niigata Prefecture or a different
    area within the same region. Secondly, population data can vary based on the source
    and the time it was collected, which could lead to different answers depending
    on the reference point. Therefore, the question can be interpreted in multiple
    ways based on these ambiguities.
  - The question compares the population of Tioga County, New York, with that of Gosen,
    Niigata. However, it is ambiguous because "Gosen, Niigata" could refer to the
    city of Gosen or the larger Niigata Prefecture, leading to different interpretations
    and answers. Additionally, population figures can vary over time, adding another
    layer of potential ambiguity.
  - The question asks for a comparison of population between Tioga County, New York,
    and Gosen, Niigata. However, it is ambiguous because it does not specify the time
    frame for the population data, which can change over time. Moreover, the question
    could also be interpreted in terms of different metrics of population (e.g., current
    population, population density, etc.). These factors can lead to different interpretations
    and answers.

    be ambiguity due to several factors: 1) There might be multiple places named Nala
    in Nepal, leading to confusion over which specific Nala is being referred to.
    2) The question does not specify a particular time frame for the population data,
    which could affect the answer if population sizes have changed over time. 3) If
    either place is small and lacks readily available population data, it may be difficult
    to provide a definitive answer. These factors introduce ambiguity into the question
    as there could be different interpretations of what is meant by Nala, Nepal, and
    the time frame for the population data. Therefore, the question admits more than

    was collected. Additionally, there may be multiple places with similar names,
    further complicating the interpretation.'
  - The question asks whether Nala, Nepal is more populous than Safety Beach, Victoria.
    The question appears to be clear in its request for a comparison of population
    sizes between two specific places. However, there could be ambiguity because the
    population data for these places may not be readily available or up-to-date, leading
    to potential variability in the answer depending on the source of information.
    Additionally, "more populous" might imply current population, but without a specific
    time frame mentioned, different interpretations of the term "more populous" could
    arise based on different data sources or times. This potential for multiple interpretations
    based on different data points makes the question ambiguous.
  - 'The question is comparing the population of two specific locations: Nala in Nepal

    reference could lead to different interpretations and answers depending on which
    place is assumed to be "Bari, India".'
  - The question is ambiguous because it references "Bari, India," a location that
    does not seem to exist, which leads to multiple interpretations. It could be a
    typo or confusion with a different place, such as Bari in Italy or another similarly
    named location. Without clarification on which "Bari" is intended, the question
    cannot be definitively answered, and different interpretations could yield different
    answers.
  - The question is ambiguous because it contains a factual error regarding the existence
    of "Bari, India." Bari is a city in Italy, and there is no widely recognized city
    named Bari in India. This could lead to different interpretations based on assumptions
    about the intended location, making it unclear how to accurately compare the populations
    of Bossier City and a non-existent or misidentified place.
  - The question is ambiguous because it asks for a comparison of population between
    two places, Bossier City, Louisiana, and Bari, India. However, there is no city
    named Bari in India, which creates confusion. The question could be intended to
    refer to a different place in India, or there might be a misunderstanding about
    the name or location. Due to this ambiguity in the location of "Bari, India,"
    the question cannot be definitively answered as it stands.
  - The question is AMBIGUOUS because it contains a geographical error. Bossier City
    is indeed a place in Louisiana, USA, but Bari, as mentioned in the question, is
    not a recognized city in India. There is a city named Bari in Italy, which could
    lead to confusion and different interpretations regarding which location the question
    is referring to. This ambiguity makes it impossible to determine a clear and correct
    answer based on the information given.
  - The question is ambiguous because it contains incorrect information. Bari is not
    a city in India; it is a city in Italy. This creates confusion about which place
    the question is referring to, leading to multiple interpretations. One might interpret
    the question as comparing Bossier City to the Italian city of Bari, while another
    might assume there is a lesser-known place named Bari in India. Due to this ambiguity,
    the question cannot be clearly answered without further clarification.
  - The question asks whether Bossier City, Louisiana is more populous than Bari,
    India. However, there is ambiguity because "Bari" in India is not a well-known
    city or location. It is possible that the question is referring to a lesser-known
    or misspelled place, or there might be confusion with "Bari" in Italy. Without
    clear identification of "Bari, India," the question admits multiple interpretations,
    leading to different answers depending on which location the question intends
    to refer to.
  - The question is AMBIGUOUS because it contains a factual error regarding the location
    of "Bari, India." Bari is not a well-known city in India, which could lead to
    different interpretations. The intended comparison might be unclear as there could
    be confusion about what "Bari" refers to. Additionally, the population comparison
    requires specific data that may vary over time, adding another layer of ambiguity.
  - The question is ambiguous for a couple of reasons. Firstly, there is a geographical
    error in the question as there is no city named Bari in India; Bari is a city
    in Italy. This could lead to different interpretations of the question regarding
    the intended location. Secondly, without a specific timeframe or population data,
    the question could be interpreted differently based on varying population statistics
    over time.
  - The question asks whether Bossier City, Louisiana is more populous than Bari,
    India. However, the question is ambiguous because it references "Bari, India,"
    which does not correspond to a well-known or easily identifiable location in India.
    There is a well-known city named Bari in Italy, but not in India, which suggests
    a possible mistake or unclear reference in the question. Without a definitive
    understanding of what "Bari, India" refers to, the question admits more than one
    interpretation and could lead to different answers depending on the intended location.

    in interpreting what is being asked. Basirhat II is a community development block
    in West Bengal, India, and Hougang is a planning area and residential town in
    the North-East Region of Singapore. The potential ambiguity arises from the lack
    of specific context or data source for population figures, as population data
    can vary based on the time of the data collection and the source. Additionally,
    the geographical areas are quite different in nature and scope, which might not
    be directly comparable without additional context. Due to these factors, the question
    can be interpreted in different ways, leading to different answers depending on
    the data used. Therefore, it is considered ambiguous.
  - The question asks about the population comparison between Basirhat II and Hougang.
    However, without additional context or specific data sources, the question can
    be interpreted in multiple ways. For instance, the question does not specify a
    particular point in time or the data source to be used for determining the population
    figures. Additionally, the comparison could be based on different population metrics
    (e.g., resident population, daytime population). This lack of specificity in terms
    of context and metrics leads to potential ambiguity in answering the question.
  - The question is asking for a comparison of the population sizes between Basirhat
    II and Hougang. The question is straightforward in that it is asking for a specific
    demographic comparison, which suggests there is a factual answer based on population
    data. However, the ambiguity arises from not specifying a time frame for the population
    data being considered. Population sizes can change over time, so without a specified
    date or period, different interpretations could lead to different answers. Additionally,
    it assumes the reader knows the locations being referred to, which may not be
    the case for all audiences, adding to potential ambiguity.
  - The question asks whether Basirhat II is more populous than Hougang. However,
    it is ambiguous for a couple of reasons. Firstly, "Basirhat II" and "Hougang"
    refer to different geographical entities; Basirhat II is a community development
    block in India, while Hougang is a planning area and residential town in Singapore.
    The question does not specify which aspect of "populous" is being compared (e.g.,
    population size, population density), and different interpretations could lead
    to different answers. Additionally, without a specified time frame or data source,
    the comparison could vary depending on when the population data is collected or
    referenced.
  - The question asks for a comparison of population between Basirhat II and Hougang.
    This question is ambiguous for a couple of reasons. Firstly, "Basirhat II" could
    refer to a specific administrative region within India, but it might not be widely
    recognized without additional context. Secondly, "Hougang" is a well-known area
    in Singapore, but without specifying the time frame or the specific boundaries
    being considered, the comparison could vary. Additionally, population figures
    can change over time, so a specific time reference is needed for clarity. Without
    further context or definitions, the question could lead to different interpretations
    and answers.
  - 'The question asks whether Basirhat II is more populous than Hougang. This requires
    comparing the population of two specific places: Basirhat II and Hougang. The

    population figures. Additionally, population data can vary by source and time,
    which could lead to discrepancies in the answer. Therefore, the question admits
    multiple interpretations and potential answers based on these factors.
  - The question asks whether Namsai district is more populous than Mong, Azad Kashmir.
    To answer this, one would need specific population data for both Namsai district
    and Mong, Azad Kashmir. The question is straightforward in its request for a comparison
    of population sizes between two specific locations. However, there could be ambiguity
    due to the naming conventions and potential changes in administrative boundaries
    or population data over time. Additionally, without specific data, the answer
    could vary depending on the time of reference for the population statistics.
  - The question asks about the population comparison between Namsai district and
    Mong, Azad Kashmir. While the question seems straightforward, it lacks specific
    details such as the time frame for the population data. Population figures can
    change over time due to growth or decline, and without specifying a particular
    year or data source, the question could lead to different answers based on different
    data sets. Additionally, the question assumes that Mong is a well-defined area,
    but without additional context, it might be unclear which specific area is being
    referred to. Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation regarding
    the data and context required to answer it accurately.

  - The question asks about the population comparison between Hosdurg taluk and Loja
    Province. However, it lacks specific details such as the time frame or data source
    for the population figures. Furthermore, it assumes that the population data for
    both locations is readily available and comparable, which might not be the case.
    This can lead to different interpretations based on different data sources or
    time periods.
  - 'The question asks for a comparison of the population between Hosdurg taluk and
    Loja Province. This question is potentially ambiguous due to the following reasons:

    1. The current population data for both regions may vary depending on the source

    specific sources or data should be used for the population figures, leading to
    potential discrepancies in the answer depending on the data source. These factors
    create multiple interpretations and potential answers, making the question ambiguous.
  - The question asks whether Hosdurg taluk is more populous than Loja Province. This
    question could be considered ambiguous for several reasons. Firstly, "Hosdurg
    taluk" refers to a subdivision in the Kasaragod district of Kerala, India, while
    "Loja Province" is a region in Ecuador. Comparing populations between two different
    types of administrative regions can be challenging due to differences in how populations
    are recorded and reported. Additionally, without specific timeframes or data sources,
    the question could have multiple interpretations based on different population
    data from different years or reports. Therefore, the question could lead to different
    answers depending on how these factors are interpreted.
  - The question asks for a comparison of population between Hosdurg taluk and Loja
    Province. However, it is ambiguous because it does not specify the context or

    without a specified year or data source, the question could lead to different
    answers. Additionally, it is unclear whether the comparison is meant to be current,
    historical, or projected for the future. Furthermore, the entities being compared
    are not of the same administrative level, which adds another layer of ambiguity.
  - The question asks for a comparison between the population of Hosdurg taluk and
    Loja Province. However, it is ambiguous because "Hosdurg taluk" refers to a specific
    administrative region in India, while "Loja Province" refers to a province in
    Ecuador. The populations of these regions can change over time, and without a
    specific timeframe or source for the data, the question can lead to different
    answers depending on the data used for comparison. Additionally, there might be
    variations in how populations are counted or reported in different regions, adding
    another layer of complexity to the question.
  - The question asks whether Hosdurg taluk is more populous than Loja Province. However,
    it is ambiguous because it compares two geographical entities that may not be
    directly comparable due to differences in administrative categorization and available
    population data. "Hosdurg taluk" is a taluk in India, while "Loja Province" is
    a province in Ecuador, and population data might not be readily comparable or
    available for the same time period or using similar methods. Additionally, the
    question does not specify a time frame for the population data, which could lead
    to different interpretations based on different data sources or time periods.

  - The question compares the population of Little Hulton and Shuanghu County. However,
    without specific data or a defined time frame, it is unclear whether the question
    is referring to current or historical population figures. Additionally, there
    is an inherent ambiguity because the populations of these places may change over
    time, and without specifying the date or source of the population data, the question
    can lead to different interpretations and answers.
  - This question is AMBIGUOUS because it asks for a comparison of population sizes
    between Little Hulton and Shuanghu County, but it does not specify which data
    or source should be used for the population figures. Additionally, the question
    could be interpreted in different ways depending on the context or time period

    without specific data, it's unclear whether the question refers to current population
    sizes, historical data, or projected future populations.
  - The question asks for a comparison of population sizes between Little Hulton and
    Shuanghu County. While it seems straightforward, the ambiguity arises from potential
    differences in data sources, timeframes, or definitions of the geographical boundaries
    considered (e.g., does Little Hulton refer to a specific area within a larger
    city, and is Shuanghu County considered in its current administrative status?).
    These factors could lead to different interpretations and answers depending on
    the specific data used for comparison.
  - The question asks for a comparison of the population sizes between Little Hulton
    and Shuanghu County. However, there are multiple interpretations possible due
    to the lack of specificity in the question. For instance, "Little Hulton" could
    refer to different data points such as a district or a ward, and the time period
    for the population data is not specified. Additionally, population data may vary
    based on the source or the year considered. Therefore, these ambiguities lead

  - The question asks for a comparison of the population size between Little Hulton
    and Shuanghu County. However, the question is ambiguous because it does not specify
    which data or time period should be considered for determining the population
    sizes. Population figures can change over time due to various factors, and without
    a specific timeframe or data source, different interpretations could lead to different
    answers. Additionally, the question does not clarify if it is considering the
    current population or historical data, further contributing to its ambiguity.
  - The question "Is Little Hulton more populous than Shuanghu County?" is AMBIGUOUS.
    This is because the term "Little Hulton" could refer to a specific area within
    Salford, Greater Manchester, England, while "Shuanghu County" refers to a county
    in the Tibet Autonomous Region of China. These two places are fundamentally different
    in terms of administrative classification and population metrics, which makes
    direct comparison complex. Additionally, without a specific time frame or source
    for population data, the question could lead to multiple interpretations based
    on different datasets or assumptions about population growth or decline.
  - The question asks about the population comparison between Little Hulton and Shuanghu
    County. While this question seems straightforward, it is ambiguous because it
    does not specify a time frame for the population data, which could vary over time.
    Additionally, "more populous" could be interpreted in different contexts, such
    as permanent residents versus transient populations. Without specifying these
    details, the question can lead to different answers depending on the interpretation
    and the data source used.
  - The question asks for a comparison of population size between Little Hulton and
    Shuanghu County. However, this is ambiguous because it does not specify the time
    frame or the source of the population data. Population figures can vary based
    on different data sources or years. Additionally, Little Hulton is a suburb, whereas
    Shuanghu County is an administrative region, which could lead to different interpretations
    of what areas are being compared.
  - The question compares the population of Little Hulton and Shuanghu County. However,
    it is ambiguous because it lacks clarity on the time frame for the population
    data. Additionally, the entities being compared are different in nature; Little
    Hulton is a district within a city in the UK, while Shuanghu County is a larger
    administrative region in China. The populations of these areas can vary significantly
    depending on the specific data source and time period considered. This ambiguity
    in the definition and scope of "more populous" could lead to different interpretations
    and answers.

    This introduces ambiguity because different interpretations of "more populous"
    could lead to different answers depending on the data used.
  - The question asks for a comparison of the population sizes between Beerwah, Queensland,
    and Govindgarh, Rajasthan. It seems straightforward as it requires checking population
    data for these two specific locations to determine which one is more populous.
    However, the question could be considered ambiguous because it doesn't specify
    the point in time for which the population comparison is to be made. Populations
    can change over time, and without a specified date or year, the comparison could
    lead to different answers depending on the data available from different years.
    Therefore, the lack of a specific timeframe introduces ambiguity.
  - The question asks for a comparison of the populations of Beerwah, Queensland,
    and Govindgarh, Rajasthan. While the question seems straightforward, it is ambiguous
    because there might be multiple places with the name "Govindgarh" in Rajasthan,

  - 'The question asks whether Bronkhorstspruit is more populous than Bobbio. This
    is a straightforward comparison of the populations of two specific places. The
    interpretation of the question is clear: it seeks a comparison based on population
    size. There is only one correct answer, which can be determined by looking up
    the population figures for Bronkhorstspruit and Bobbio. Therefore, the question
    does not allow for multiple interpretations.'
  - The question asks if Bronkhorstspruit is more populous than Bobbio. The interpretation
    hinges on understanding "more populous," which generally refers to population
    size. However, the ambiguity arises because the question does not specify any
    particular time frame or source for population data, and population figures can
    change over time. Without a specific time frame or data source, different answers
    could be derived based on different data sets or time periods. Therefore, the
    question can be interpreted in multiple ways, leading to potentially different
    answers.
  - The question asks for a comparison of the populations of Bronkhorstspruit and
    Bobbio. While the question seems straightforward, it assumes that the reader knows
    which specific locations are being referred to. Bronkhorstspruit is a city in
    South Africa, and Bobbio is a town in Italy. However, without explicit context
    or clarification, someone might interpret these names as referring to different
    locations with similar names. Moreover, population figures can vary depending
    on the data source and the year of the population estimate. Thus, there could
    be ambiguity regarding which population data to use for comparison.
  - 'The question asks if Bronkhorstspruit is more populous than Bobbio. This question
    is clear because it specifies two places and asks for a straightforward comparison
    of their populations. There is only one way to interpret the question: comparing

    not imply any additional context or require interpretation beyond comparing population
    numbers, assuming the reader has access to the relevant demographic data.'
  - The question asks whether Bronkhorstspruit is more populous than Bobbio. On the
    surface, this seems straightforward as it is a comparison of population sizes
    between two places. However, the question becomes ambiguous because it does not
    specify the time frame or the source of population data. Population figures can
    vary depending on the year of the data, the organization providing the statistics,
    and whether the population count includes surrounding areas or just the core town.
    Therefore, without further specification, the question can be interpreted in multiple
    ways, leading to different answers depending on the data source and time frame
    considered.
  - The question asks whether Bronkhorstspruit is more populous than Bobbio. This
    can be interpreted in a straightforward manner as a comparison of the population
    sizes of two specific locations, Bronkhorstspruit and Bobbio. The question is
    clear in its intent and requires a factual answer based on demographic data. Therefore,
    it only admits one interpretation and one correct answer, depending on the current
    population statistics of the two places.

    of the two is more populous.'
  - The question asks whether Bronkhorstspruit is more populous than Bobbio. This
    is a comparison of the populations of two specific locations. The question is
    clear in its intent, as it directly compares the population sizes of these two
    places. Although the answer may require looking up population data, the question
    itself does not admit multiple interpretations. Therefore, it is straightforward
    in what it is asking.
  - 'The question is asking for a comparison of population sizes between two places:
    Bronkhorstspruit and Bobbio. The interpretation seems straightforward as it seeks

    the comparison criteria (population) is straightforward. Tourouvre is a commune
    in France, and Lumarzo is a comune in Italy. Assuming these are the places intended,
    the question is clear as it asks for a direct comparison of population sizes.
    There is no indication of multiple interpretations regarding the places or the
    nature of the comparison.'
  - The question asks whether Tourouvre is more populous than Lumarzo. This appears
    to be a straightforward comparison of the populations of two places, which should
    have a definitive answer based on demographic data. However, the ambiguity arises
    from the fact that there might be different places named Tourouvre or Lumarzo,
    and the question does not specify which ones are being referred to. Without additional
    context or specific identifiers (such as country names or regions), it is unclear
    which locations are meant, leading to potential multiple interpretations and thus
    different answers.
  - The question asks for a comparison between the populations of Tourouvre and Lumarzo.
    However, the question does not specify which specific locations it is referring
    to, as there could be multiple places named Tourouvre or Lumarzo. Without additional
    context or specification, the question could be interpreted in multiple ways,
    leading to different answers depending on which specific places are being compared.
  - The question asks whether Tourouvre is more populous than Lumarzo. To answer this,
    one would typically compare the population sizes of these two specific places.
    However, the question does not provide a clear context or specify which version
    of "Tourouvre" is being referred to, as place names can sometimes be shared by
    multiple locations worldwide. Similarly, Lumarzo might refer to a specific location
    or could be confused with similarly named places. Without additional context,
    such as country or region, the question remains open to interpretation. Therefore,
    different interpretations could lead to different answers depending on which places
    are being considered.
  - 'The question asks for a comparison of the population sizes between two places:
    Tourouvre and Lumarzo. However, it does not specify any additional context such
    as time frame, specific areas within these places, or whether recent population
    data is being considered. Without further context, the question could be interpreted
    in multiple ways (e.g., based on historical data, current data, or future projections).
    This lack of specificity leads to potential ambiguity in determining which population
    data should be used to answer the question accurately.'
  - The question asks whether Tourouvre is more populous than Lumarzo. However, the
    question is ambiguous because it does not specify which Tourouvre is being referred
    to, as there may be more than one place with the same name. Similarly, it does
    not specify a time frame for the population data, which can vary over time. Additionally,
    if there are multiple ways to define the boundaries of these places (such as considering
    metropolitan areas versus city limits), this could further complicate the interpretation.
    Therefore, due to the lack of specificity and potential for multiple interpretations,
    the question is ambiguous.
  - The question asks for a comparison of population between two places, Tourouvre
    and Lumarzo. However, it does not specify which Tourouvre or Lumarzo is being
    referred to, as there may be multiple places with similar names in different parts
    of the world. Without additional context or specification, it is unclear which
    locations are being compared, leading to multiple possible interpretations and
    answers. Therefore, the question is ambiguous.
  - The question asks whether Tourouvre is more populous than Lumarzo. The question
    is potentially ambiguous because it lacks specificity regarding the time frame
    or the criteria for population measurement. Population numbers can change over
    time due to various factors such as migration, birth rates, and administrative
    changes. Without specifying a particular year or source for the population data,
    there could be different interpretations based on different data sets or time
    periods.
  - The question asks whether Tourouvre is more populous than Lumarzo. To answer this,
    one would need specific population data for both locations. However, the question

    former administrative region of France that has been merged into Normandy, which
    could lead to confusion about whether the question refers to the historical region
    or the current administrative area. These multiple interpretations can result
    in different answers depending on the specific entities being compared.
  - The question asks if Samar is more populous than Upper Normandy. This question
    is ambiguous because "Samar" could refer to Samar Island in the Philippines or
    the Samar region in Brazil. Similarly, "Upper Normandy" was an administrative

    of the question, such as whether to consider the population of the entire county
    versus just the city of Clermont. Therefore, the question admits more than one
    interpretation, leading to potentially different answers depending on how the
    comparison is approached.
  - The question is asking for a comparison of population sizes between Delaware County,
    Oklahoma, and Clermont, Florida. On the surface, this seems straightforward; however,
    the ambiguity arises from the fact that Clermont is a city, while Delaware County
    is a county. Comparing a county's population to a city's population can be misleading
    without specifying whether the comparison should be between similar administrative
    units. This could lead to different interpretations depending on whether the inquirer
    is interested in the population of the entire county versus a city or if they
    are considering a specific area within these regions.
  - 'The question asks for a comparison of population sizes between Delaware County,
    Oklahoma, and Clermont, Florida. While the phrasing is slightly informal, the
    question is specific in what it seeks: a comparison of population figures between
    two distinct geographic locations. There is only one interpretation of the question,
    which is to determine which location has a higher population. Therefore, this
    question does not admit multiple interpretations and can be answered with specific
    population data.'
  - 'The question asks for a comparison of population sizes between two specific places:
    Delaware County, Oklahoma, and Clermont, Florida. It is clear in what information
    it seeks: the population numbers of the two locations. However, it is ambiguous
    because it doesn''t specify whether it is comparing the entire county of Delaware
    in Oklahoma to the city of Clermont, Florida, or if it is comparing a different
    area named Clermont. Additionally, it does not specify a timeframe for the population
    data, which could affect the answer. These factors introduce multiple interpretations
    of the question.'
  - The question is asking for a comparison of population sizes between Delaware County
    in Oklahoma and Clermont in Florida. However, there is an ambiguity here because
    "Clermont" could refer to the city of Clermont in Florida or to another geographical
    or administrative entity. Without a specific reference to the correct entity,
    the question could be interpreted differently, leading to different answers. Additionally,
    "Clermont, Florida" could also be considered as the broader area or a specific
    part of it, contributing further to the ambiguity.
  - The question asks for a comparison of the populations of Delaware County, Oklahoma,
    and Clermont, Florida. At first glance, this seems straightforward; however, it
    is ambiguous because it does not specify whether it is referring to the city of
    Clermont or a larger administrative area such as Clermont County, if it exists.
    Additionally, the population figures could vary depending on the time frame in
    question (e.g., based on different census years or estimates). Thus, the question
    admits more than one interpretation, leading to potential variations in the answer
    depending on these factors.
  - The question is asking for a comparison of population between Delaware County,
    Oklahoma, and Clermont, Florida. The question is specific and does not admit multiple
    interpretations. There is only one way to interpret the question, which is to
    compare the population sizes of the specified locations. Therefore, it can be
    answered definitively with the available data on their populations.
  - The question is asking for a comparison of population sizes between Delaware County
    in Oklahoma and Clermont in Florida. However, there is an ambiguity because it
    is not clear if "Clermont, Florida" refers to the city of Clermont or a broader
    area that could be interpreted as Clermont County (which does not exist but could
    be misconstrued). Without further specification, the question could lead to different
    interpretations and answers depending on whether "Clermont" is considered as just
    the city or an assumed larger area.
  - The question asks for a comparison of the population sizes between Delaware County
    in Oklahoma and Clermont in Florida. While the question is straightforward in
    asking for a population comparison, it does not specify whether "Clermont, Florida"
    refers to the city of Clermont or a broader area like Clermont County, if such
    exists. However, since Clermont is commonly known as a city in Florida and there
    is no Clermont County in Florida, the likely interpretation is a comparison between
    Delaware County, Oklahoma, and the city of Clermont, Florida. Thus, the question
    can be interpreted clearly without much ambiguity.

  - The question asks for a comparison of the population sizes between Fayette County,
    Texas, and Qabatiya. To determine whether the question is clear or ambiguous,
    we must consider the specificity and context of the entities involved. Fayette
    County, Texas, is a defined geographical area in the United States, and Qabatiya
    is a town in the West Bank. The question does not specify the timeframe for the
    population data, which could vary over time, but generally, population comparisons
    are understood to be based on the most recent available data. Therefore, this
    question has a single interpretation, which is to compare the current populations
    of these two places using the latest available data. Since the question directs
    us to compare two specific locations based on population size, it is asking for
    a factual comparison that can be answered with the most recent census or demographic
    data.
  - 'The question asks for a comparison of the population sizes between Fayette County,

    Island" may refer to a geographic area that could include multiple settlements,
    while Garfield County is a specific administrative region. Additionally, the term
    "more populous" could be interpreted differently depending on the data source
    or the specific areas considered. This ambiguity in geographic definitions and
    potential variations in population data sources could lead to different interpretations
    and answers.
  - The question is asking for a comparison between the populations of Garfield County,
    Nebraska, and Ammassalik Island. However, there are multiple ambiguities present
    in the question. Firstly, Ammassalik Island is not an official administrative
    area but a reference to an area around Tasiilaq in Greenland, which could lead
    to confusion about which specific region or settlement is being compared. Secondly,
    population data can vary depending on the source and the time when it was collected,
    which could affect the comparison. Due to these ambiguities, the question admits
    more than one interpretation, leading to different possible answers.
  - "The question involves comparing the population of two geographic locations: Garfield\

  - The question compares the populations of Garfield County, Nebraska, and Ammassalik
    Island. However, the question is ambiguous for several reasons. First, it does
    not specify which "Ammassalik Island" it refers to, as there could be confusion
    with areas around Tasiilaq in Greenland. Additionally, population data can vary
    depending on the source and the time the data was collected, which could lead
    to different answers. The question does not provide a specific timeframe or data
    source for the population figures, adding to the ambiguity.
  - The question is asking for a population comparison between Garfield County, Nebraska,
    and Ammassalik Island. While the question seems straightforward, it is ambiguous
    because the names refer to specific geographic entities that may not be universally
    recognized or consistently defined. Garfield County, Nebraska, is a clearly defined
    administrative region in the United States. However, Ammassalik Island could refer
    to an island in Greenland, but there might be confusion about what exactly is
    being compared, such as the island itself or a specific settlement on the island.
    Additionally, population data can vary depending on the source and the time at
    which the data was collected, adding another layer of ambiguity to the question.
  - The question asks for a comparison of population between Garfield County, Nebraska,
    and Ammassalik Island. However, the question is ambiguous due to a lack of specificity
    regarding the time frame for the population data, and the fact that Ammassalik
    Island is not a standard administrative division, but part of the larger Sermersooq
    municipality in Greenland. Additionally, the population can vary over time, and
    different data sources might provide different figures. Therefore, the question
    can lead to multiple interpretations and answers based on different assumptions
    or sources.

    as it asks which of the two places has a larger population. However, the question
    can be considered ambiguous because it does not specify the time frame for the
    population data being compared. Population figures can change over time due to
    various factors such as migration, birth rates, and administrative changes. Without
    a specified time frame or source for the population data, the question could be
    interpreted differently based on different data sets or years.'
  - The question asks whether the Municipality of Piran is more populous than Mollendo.
    To answer this, one would need current population data for both locations. However,
    the question itself is clear in its intent and does not admit multiple interpretations.
    It specifically asks for a population comparison between two distinct places.
    Therefore, the question is straightforward and would have a single correct answer
    based on the available population data.
  - 'The question asks whether the Municipality of Piran is more populous than Mollendo.
    This question is clear in its request for a comparison of population sizes between
    two specific places: the Municipality of Piran and Mollendo. There is no ambiguity
    in the phrasing, as it specifically asks for a population comparison, which is
    a factual query. Therefore, the question admits only one interpretation and has
    a definitive answer based on population data.'
  - 'The question asks whether the Municipality of Piran is more populous than Mollendo.
    The question is comparing the populations of two specific places: Piran and Mollendo.
    The interpretation of the question seems straightforward as it seeks a comparison
    based on population figures. However, potential ambiguity arises from the lack
    of specified time frame or data source. Population figures can change over time,
    and without a specified date or source, the question might yield different answers
    based on different datasets or times of reference. Therefore, the question could
    be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the context of the data used.'
  - The question asks whether the Municipality of Piran is more populous than Mollendo.
    The question is straightforward in its request for a comparison of population
    sizes between two specific locations. However, the ambiguity arises from the fact
    that population data can vary depending on the source and the date of the data.
    Additionally, the term "Municipality of Piran" might refer to different geographical
    definitions (e.g., city center vs. entire administrative area), and similarly,
    "Mollendo" might have different population figures depending on the context. Without
    specific population data or definitions, the question could be interpreted differently,
    leading to different answers.
  - 'The question asks whether the Municipality of Piran is more populous than Mollendo.
    This requires comparing the population sizes of two specific locations: the Municipality
    of Piran and Mollendo. However, the question is ambiguous because it does not
    specify the time frame for the population data, which could vary over time. Additionally,
    the term "Municipality of Piran" could refer to different administrative boundaries
    or updates in geographic definitions, leading to different interpretations. Furthermore,
    without a specific data source or year, the population figures can differ depending
    on the source used.'
  - 'The question is asking for a comparison of the populations of two specific locations:
    the Municipality of Piran and Mollendo. However, it is ambiguous because it doesn''t
    specify which point in time the population data should be considered, and populations

    data that could give slightly varying figures. Therefore, without a clear specification
    of the time and data source, this question can lead to different interpretations
    and answers.'
  - The question asks whether the Municipality of Piran is more populous than Mollendo.
    This is a straightforward comparison between the populations of two specific locations.
    The question is clear in its intent, seeking a direct comparison of population
    sizes. However, without additional context such as a specific year or data source
    for the populations, the question assumes current or generally accepted figures.
    This does not introduce ambiguity in the interpretation of the question itself,
    only in how the answer might be determined depending on the data source. Therefore,
    the question is considered to have one interpretation.
  - The question asks about the population comparison between the Municipality of
    Piran and Mollendo. While the question seems straightforward, it can be considered
    ambiguous because it does not specify the time frame for the population data.

  - The question asks for a comparison of the population sizes of Comacchio and Clifton,
    Bristol. However, there is ambiguity because "Clifton, Bristol" could refer to
    either a specific ward or a broader area within Bristol, which can have different
    population figures. Additionally, the question does not specify a particular point
    in time for the population comparison, which could affect the answer due to changes
    in population over time. These factors make the question open to multiple interpretations.
  - The question is asking for a comparison of population sizes between Comacchio
    and Clifton, Bristol. However, there are multiple interpretations possible here.
    First, "Clifton, Bristol" could refer to a specific ward or district within the
    city of Bristol, or it could be seen as part of the city itself, which would affect
    the population size being referred to. Similarly, the question does not specify
    which Comacchio is being referred to, although it is likely to mean Comacchio
    in Italy, it leaves room for ambiguity if there were other places named Comacchio.
    Additionally, population figures can change over time, and the question does not
    specify a date or year for the population comparison. These different interpretations
    can lead to different answers regarding which place is more populous.
  - 'The question asks about the population comparison between Comacchio and Clifton,
    Bristol. This appears to be a straightforward question, but it could be interpreted
    in two ways: 1) Comacchio as a whole municipality compared to the district or
    ward of Clifton within Bristol, or 2) Comacchio compared to the entire city of
    Bristol. These different interpretations could lead to different answers, as the
    populations of these areas can vary significantly depending on the scope considered.
    Therefore, the question is ambiguous because it does not specify which part of
    Clifton, Bristol is being compared to Comacchio.'
  - The question asks whether Comacchio is more populous than Clifton, Bristol. While
    the question appears straightforward, it is ambiguous because "Clifton, Bristol"
    is a district within the city of Bristol, UK, and its population can be defined
    in various ways depending on the boundaries considered. Additionally, the population
    of Comacchio, a town in Italy, can also be subject to varying data depending on
    the source and date. Without specifying the exact boundaries or the year for the
    population data, the question admits more than one interpretation, potentially
    leading to different answers.
  - "The question is asking for a comparison of population size between Comacchio\
    \ and Clifton, Bristol. However, the question is ambiguous for a couple of reasons:\
    \ \n\n1. \"Clifton, Bristol\" could be interpreted in multiple ways. Clifton is\
    \ a suburb of Bristol, England, but the boundaries of what constitutes \"Clifton\"\
    \ may vary. It could refer to the specific ward, the broader area known colloquially\
    \ as Clifton, or even the electoral division, each potentially having different\
    \ population sizes.\n\n2. Additionally, population data can vary depending on\
    \ the source and the year it was collected, which is not specified in the question.\
    \ \n\nTherefore, without specific definitions or context, the question could lead\
    \ to different interpretations and answers."
  - The question asks for a comparison of population sizes between Comacchio and Clifton,
    Bristol. To determine if this question is clear or ambiguous, we must assess whether
    the information required to answer it is readily available and unambiguous. "Comacchio"
    refers to a town in Italy, and "Clifton" is a suburb of Bristol, UK. The ambiguity
    arises because "Clifton" might not be consistently defined in terms of population
    data, as it is a part of a larger city and its boundaries might not be clear.
    Additionally, population data can vary depending on the source and the date it
    was collected. Without a clear definition or context for what is meant by "Clifton,"
    this question could lead to different interpretations and answers. Therefore,
    the question admits more than one interpretation and could lead to different answers
    depending on these factors.
  - "The question asks whether Comacchio is more populous than Clifton, Bristol. To\
    \ determine if this question is clear or ambiguous, we need to consider the specificity\
    \ and availability of data regarding the populations of these places. \n\nComacchio\
    \ is a town in Italy, while Clifton is an area within the city of Bristol in the\
    \ United Kingdom. The population of Comacchio can be found as a distinct figure\
    \ because it is a separate municipality. However, the population of Clifton might\
    \ be more challenging to determine precisely, as it is part of a larger city,\
    \ and population data might not be readily available specifically for Clifton\
    \ as opposed to the entire city of Bristol.\n\nThe question could be considered\
    \ ambiguous because the population of Clifton might not be clearly defined or\

    \ potential difficulty in obtaining a definitive population figure for Clifton\
    \ as a distinct entity separate from Bristol, the question admits more than one\
    \ interpretation regarding the population data sources and definitions used."
  - The question asks whether Comacchio is more populous than Clifton, Bristol. This
    question could be considered ambiguous for a couple of reasons. First, Clifton
    is a suburb of Bristol, and population data might not be readily available or
    consistent, as it could be measured at different levels (e.g., the specific area
    of Clifton, the ward, or the entire city of Bristol). Second, the population of
    places can change over time, so without a specific timeframe, the comparison might
    lead to different answers. Thus, the lack of specificity and potential for multiple
    interpretations regarding the geographic and temporal context makes the question
    ambiguous.
  - The question asks for a comparison between the populations of Comacchio and Clifton,
    Bristol. However, it is ambiguous because "Clifton, Bristol" could refer to the

    population data can vary over time and depending on the source, which adds to
    the potential for different interpretations and answers.
  - 'The question asks whether Comacchio is more populous than Clifton, Bristol. This
    requires a comparison of the populations of two places: Comacchio, a town in Italy,
    and Clifton, a suburb in Bristol, UK. The ambiguity arises because Clifton is
    not a standalone city or town with a clearly defined population; it is a part
    of the larger city of Bristol. The population of Clifton could be interpreted
    differently depending on whether one considers the specific district, the electoral
    ward, or another measure. Additionally, the population figures for each place
    may vary depending on the source or the date of the data. Therefore, the question
    admits more than one interpretation, leading to different possible answers.'

    of data at a specific time. Population figures can change over time due to various
    factors such as census updates, migration, and demographic changes. Without specifying
    a particular time or dataset for comparison, the question could lead to different
    interpretations and answers. Additionally, the entities being compared (an Upazila
    and a Province) might not have directly comparable population data available,
    adding another layer of ambiguity.
  - The question asks for a comparison of the populations between Morrelganj Upazila
    and the Province of Ragusa. While the question seems straightforward, it is ambiguous
    because the Province of Ragusa could refer to the historical Province of Ragusa
    (in Italy) before it was reorganized into Metropolitan City of Ragusa, or it might
    be a misunderstanding with the historical Republic of Ragusa. Additionally, population
    data can vary depending on the time frame or source of the data. Therefore, without
    additional context or specific references, the question could lead to different
    interpretations and answers.
  - 'The question asks for a comparison of the population size between Morrelganj
    Upazila and the Province of Ragusa. To classify the question, we need to consider
    whether it admits multiple interpretations or if it is straightforward.


    1. **Morrelganj Upazila**: This is a specific administrative region in Bangladesh,
    and its population can be determined from official statistics.


    2. **Province of Ragusa**: This might refer to a historical region, as Ragusa
    was a historical name for Dubrovnik in Croatia, or it could refer to an administrative
    region in Italy (Ragusa is a province in Sicily). The ambiguity arises from the
    potential historical or geographical context intended by the question.


    Given the possibility of interpreting "Province of Ragusa" in different ways (either
    as a historical area or a current administrative region in Italy), the question
    admits more than one interpretation. This could lead to different answers depending
    on which interpretation is chosen.


    Thus, the question is ambiguous because the term "Province of Ragusa" does not
    clearly define which specific region or time period is being referenced, and this
    affects the ability to provide a single correct answer.'

  - 'The question is comparing the population of two places: Fulton, Maryland, and
    Davyd-Haradok. The ambiguity arises because the question does not provide a specific
    point in time for the population comparison, and population figures can change
    over time due to various factors such as migration, birth rates, or administrative
    changes. Additionally, the question does not specify which specific sources or
    criteria should be used for determining the population size, leading to potential
    variations in interpretation based on different data sources or population estimates.'
  - The question asks for a comparison of the population sizes of Fulton, Maryland,
    and Davyd-Haradok. While this seems straightforward, the ambiguity arises from
    the fact that population data can change over time. Additionally, if there are
    multiple places named Fulton or Davyd-Haradok, the question could be interpreted
    differently depending on which specific locations are being referred to. However,
    if we assume that the question refers to the most commonly known locations with
    these names, it could have a clear answer based on the most recent population
    data. Nevertheless, the potential for multiple interpretations due to the lack
    of specific timeframe and possible multiple locations makes the question ambiguous.
  - 'The question is asking for a comparison of population sizes between two places:
    Fulton, Maryland, and Davyd-Haradok. The interpretation of the question is straightforward,

    for the population comparison, which could affect the answer due to potential
    population changes over time. Additionally, the spelling of "Davyd-Haradok" could
    be interpreted in different ways, possibly referring to different places or transliterations,
    which adds to the ambiguity.'
  - The question asks for a comparison of population sizes between Fulton, Maryland,
    and Davyd-Haradok. This question is ambiguous because it depends on the availability
    and accuracy of population data for these two places. Additionally, the question

    affect the answer. Thus, without additional context or up-to-date data, the question
    can lead to different interpretations and answers.
  - The question asks whether Fulton, Maryland is more populous than Davyd-Haradok.
    This question could be considered AMBIGUOUS because it relies on current population
    data, which may vary depending on the source and the time of the data. Additionally,
    the population of a place can change over time, and without specifying a particular
    year or data source, the question may not have a definitive answer. Moreover,
    "Davyd-Haradok" might be spelled differently or refer to different places depending
    on the language or region, adding to the ambiguity.
  - The question asks for a comparison of the population sizes between Fulton, Maryland,
    and Davyd-Haradok. This seems straightforward; however, it can be considered ambiguous
    because it relies on current population data, which can change over time. Additionally,
    the question assumes the reader knows or can easily access current and accurate
    population figures for both locations, which might not be readily available or
    may vary depending on the source of the data. Furthermore, "more populous" could
    also be interpreted in terms of different metrics like metropolitan area population
    or city proper, adding another layer of potential ambiguity.
  - The question asks for a comparison of the population sizes between Fulton, Maryland,
    and Davyd-Haradok. The question is straightforward in that it seeks a specific
    comparison between two locations. However, the potential ambiguity arises from
    the fact that population data can change over time, and the availability of recent
    or accurate data for both locations might affect the answer. Additionally, Davyd-Haradok
    may not be a well-known location, which could lead to different interpretations
    about its population size due to less available information or differing sources.
    Despite these factors, the question itself is specific in its request for a population
    comparison, which suggests it is seeking a factual answer based on available data.
  - The question asks whether Fulton, Maryland is more populous than Davyd-Haradok.
    The question is relatively straightforward, seeking a comparison of population
    sizes between two specific locations. However, it may be considered ambiguous
    because the population data for such locations can change over time, and there
    may be different sources with varying figures. Furthermore, Davyd-Haradok is not
    a widely recognized location and could potentially refer to different places depending
    on transliteration or historical context. Without a clear indication of the specific
    Davyd-Haradok in question, the interpretation could vary.
  - The question asks for a comparison of population sizes between Fulton, Maryland,
    and Davyd-Haradok. This is a straightforward factual query, as it seeks to compare

  - The question asks whether Port Louis District is more populous than Zihuatanejo
    de Azueta. This comparison of population sizes between two specific places is
    straightforward and can be answered by looking at population statistics. The question

    of population numbers. Therefore, it admits one interpretation and one correct
    answer based on the available data.
  - 'The question is asking for a comparison of the population between two specific
    locations: Port Louis District and Zihuatanejo de Azueta. On the surface, it seems
    straightforward as it requests a comparison based on population size. However,
    the ambiguity arises from the fact that the question refers to "Port Louis District,"
    which might be interpreted as either the entire district or just the city of Port
    Louis itself. Furthermore, "Zihuatanejo de Azueta" could be interpreted as the
    municipality or just the city of Zihuatanejo. These different interpretations
    can lead to different population figures being used for the comparison. Therefore,
    the question is ambiguous due to these potential variations in interpreting the
    geographical entities involved.'
  - The question asks about the population comparison between Port Louis District
    and Zihuatanejo de Azueta. On the surface, this seems straightforward; however,
    the ambiguity arises because the question does not specify the time frame for
    the population data. Population figures can change over time due to various factors
    such as migration, birth rates, and administrative changes. Without specifying
    a particular year or time period, the question could lead to different answers
    based on different data sets. Therefore, the lack of a specified time frame makes
    the question ambiguous.
