  - The question asks for a comparison between the lengths of the Eisenhower Tunnel
    and the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line. While the question seems straightforward, it can
    be interpreted in different ways because it doesn't specify whether the comparison
    should be based on the total length of the infrastructure, the length of the tunnel
    portion specifically, or some other measure of "length" (e.g., roadway length

    tunnel of the Channel Tunnel system. However, the term "Chunnel Service Tunnel"
    could also be misunderstood or misinterpreted as referring to a different structure
    or aspect of the Channel Tunnel. Additionally, there might be confusion about
    what is meant by "longer" (e.g., total length, operational length, etc.). Due

    The ambiguity arises from the fact that "Chunnel Service Tunnel" might specifically
    refer to the service tunnel or to the entire system of tunnels, including the

    Tunnel," but without specifying whether it is referring to the length of the entire
    service tunnel or a particular section, there could be confusion. Additionally,

  - The question "Is the Chunnel Service Tunnel longer than the Seikan Tunnel?" is
    AMBIGUOUS because it can be interpreted in more than one way. Firstly, "Chunnel"
    typically refers to the Channel Tunnel between the UK and France, but the question
    specifies the "Chunnel Service Tunnel." The Channel Tunnel has multiple components,
    including the main rail tunnels and a service tunnel, which can lead to different
    interpretations of which part is being compared. Additionally, the comparison
    with the Seikan Tunnel, which is a railway tunnel in Japan, could lead to confusion
    if one is not clear whether the total length, the length of certain parts, or
    the purpose of the tunnels is being compared. This ambiguity in interpretation
    could lead to different answers depending on how one interprets the components
    and purpose of the tunnels involved.
  - The question compares the lengths of the Chunnel Service Tunnel and the Seikan
    Tunnel. The Chunnel (Channel Tunnel) includes multiple tunnels, and the "Service
    Tunnel" specifically refers to one of them. The Seikan Tunnel is a specific and
    well-defined tunnel. However, the ambiguity arises because the question does not
    specify if it is comparing the total length of the service tunnel to the entire
    Seikan Tunnel, or if it is comparing a different aspect. Without additional context,
    there might be confusion about what specific lengths are being compared.

    Tunnel and the Seikan Tunnel. However, the term "Chunnel" typically refers to

    the "Chunnel Service Tunnel," which could be interpreted as a specific part of
    the Channel Tunnel system, while the Seikan Tunnel is a single tunnel. This could
    lead to different interpretations about which specific parts are being compared,
