  - The question asks for the relative location of Eastern Michigan University (EMU)
    in relation to its College of Health and Human Services. The question is inherently
    AMBIGUOUS because both entities are part of the same university and typically
    located on the same campus. The term "east of" could refer to specific buildings
    or offices within the university, which are not universally known or documented
    without specific campus maps. Therefore, without additional context or specific
    addresses, the question cannot be definitively answered. Furthermore, the phrasing
    suggests a misunderstanding, as a college within a university is not typically
    located separately from the university itself.
  - The question is ambiguous because it refers to two locations that are part of
    the same university (Eastern Michigan University) but does not specify distinct,
    separate campuses or addresses that could be compared geographically. The use
    of "east of" implies a directional or geographical relationship that isn't clear
    without further context or specific locations. Additionally, "Eastern Michigan
    University College of Health and Human Services" is a college within the university
    rather than a separate entity with its own location that can be compared directionally
    to the university itself. Without more information, the question can lead to multiple
    interpretations regarding what is being compared geographically.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative locations of two entities: Eastern
    Michigan University (EMU) and Eastern Michigan University College of Health and
    Human Services. However, there is ambiguity because the College of Health and
    Human Services is a part of Eastern Michigan University itself, not a separate
    entity. Therefore, asking if one is located east of the other is unclear because
    they are part of the same institution and generally located in the same area.

    for the specific positioning of buildings or departments within the campus. However,
    without a specific map or campus layout, it''s unclear whether EMU is meant as
    a general term for the entire university and EMU CHHS as a specific building or
    department. Additionally, the use of "east" could refer to a general direction

    is ambiguous because it could refer to different parts of the university's campus
    layout, which may not be well-defined publicly in terms of cardinal directions.
    Without specific geographic coordinates or a detailed map of the campus, the answer
    could vary. Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation regarding
    what is meant by "east of" in this context.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative locations of two entities: Eastern
    Michigan University (EMU) and Eastern Michigan University College of Health and

    be interpreted as either a separate entity or a part of Eastern Michigan University.
    If it''s part of EMU, then it doesn''t make sense to compare the location of EMU
    to one of its colleges in terms of east or west. Additionally, the question assumes

    because the College of Health and Human Services is not a separate geographic
    entity but a part of EMU. Therefore, it is unclear whether the question is asking
    about different campuses, different parts of the same campus, or something else
    entirely. Since EMU and its College of Health and Human Services are part of the
    same institution, the question does not have a clear interpretation regarding
    different locations. Additionally, without specific geographic coordinates or
    campus map references, it is impossible to determine a clear answer about their
    relative locations. Thus, the question is ambiguous as it can lead to different
    interpretations and does not have a definitive answer.'
  - The question asks about the relative location of Eastern Michigan University (EMU)
    in Michigan and its College of Health and Human Services. The ambiguity arises
    because both entities are part of the same university, and the question does not
    specify whether it is asking about different campuses or buildings. Furthermore,
    since EMU's College of Health and Human Services is a part of the main university,
    the question could be interpreted as asking about the location of specific buildings
    within the same campus. Without additional context or specification, it is unclear
    how to determine a meaningful eastward comparison between these entities.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative location of two entities: Eastern Michigan
    University (EMU) and Eastern Michigan University College of Health and Human Services.
    However, it is ambiguous because it is not clear whether "Eastern Michigan University"
    refers to the main campus or another specific location within the university.
    Additionally, the "Eastern Michigan University College of Health and Human Services"
    is part of EMU and likely located on the same campus. Therefore, the question
    could be interpreted in different ways depending on what is meant by "Eastern
    Michigan University" and the specific locations being compared.'
  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographic locations of two entities:
    "Eastern Michigan University, MI" and "Eastern Michigan University College of
    Health and Human Services, MI." However, the question is ambiguous because it
    is unclear if these refer to separate institutions or if the "College of Health
    and Human Services" is a part of Eastern Michigan University. If the latter is
    true, it would not make sense to compare their locations as they are part of the
    same institution. Additionally, without clear geographic coordinates or addresses,
    the question cannot be definitively answered. Therefore, the question admits more
    than one interpretation and could lead to different answers.'

  - 'The question is asking about the geographical location of two entities: the University
    of Georgia and Franklin College of Arts and Sciences. However, there is ambiguity
    because Franklin College of Arts and Sciences is not a separate geographical location;
    it is a part of the University of Georgia. Therefore, the question is essentially
    asking if one part of the University of Georgia is east of the university itself,
    which does not make sense. The question could be interpreted in different ways
    depending on how one understands the relationship between the two entities, leading
    to confusion and multiple interpretations.'
  - The question asks about the relative location of the University of Georgia and
    Franklin College of Arts and Sciences, both of which are in Georgia. However,
    Franklin College of Arts and Sciences is not a separate institution; it is actually
    a part of the University of Georgia, located on its campus in Athens, GA. This
    makes the question inherently ambiguous because it assumes they are distinct entities
    that can be geographically compared. The question could be interpreted as asking
    about different parts of the same university, but without clear information on
    what specific locations are being compared, it remains ambiguous.
  - The question asks if the University of Georgia is located east of Franklin College
    of Arts and Sciences. However, the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences is a
    part of the University of Georgia, both located in Athens, GA. This creates confusion
    as the question does not make sense in terms of location comparison between a
    university and one of its constituent colleges. Therefore, the question is ambiguous
    because it could be interpreted in different ways depending on the understanding
    of the relationship between the two entities mentioned.
  - The question is asking about the relative geographical location of the University
    of Georgia (UGA) in relation to the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences. However,
    the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences is not a separate entity but is actually
    a part of the University of Georgia, which could lead to confusion. If interpreted
    as separate entities, the question could be misleading, but if understood in the
    context that Franklin College is part of UGA, it makes the question nonsensical.
    Due to these interpretations, the question can be seen as ambiguous.
  - The question asks whether the University of Georgia is located east of the Franklin
    College of Arts and Sciences. However, the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences
    is actually a part of the University of Georgia, not a separate entity. This makes
    the question ambiguous because it seems to ask for a geographical comparison between
    two entities that are not distinct. The interpretation could be whether a specific
    part of the campus is located east of another, but this isn't clear from the question.
  - 'The question asks if the University of Georgia, GA is located east of Franklin
    College of Arts and Sciences, GA. The University of Georgia is a specific institution
    that includes the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences as one of its colleges.
    Therefore, the question is asking if one part of the University of Georgia is
    east of another part within the same institution. This can be interpreted in multiple
    ways: it could be asking about the physical locations of the administrative buildings
    or about the general geographic location of departments. The ambiguity arises
    because Franklin College of Arts and Sciences is not a separate entity but part
    of the University of Georgia, and the question does not specify what aspect of
    "location" it refers to, nor does it clarify whether it considers the broader
    campus or specific buildings. Hence, the question admits more than one interpretation,
    which could lead to different answers.'
  - The question is asking about the geographical location of the University of Georgia
    in relation to the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences. However, the Franklin
    College of Arts and Sciences is a part of the University of Georgia, so they are

    of Georgia and Franklin College of Arts and Sciences. However, there is ambiguity
    because Franklin College of Arts and Sciences is actually a part of the University
    of Georgia, not a separate entity. This makes the question inherently ambiguous
    as it could be interpreted as comparing the University of Georgia to a subpart
    of itself, which does not make geographical sense. Additionally, the question
    does not specify if it is referring to the main campus location or a specific
    building within the university, adding further ambiguity.'
  - 'The question is asking about the geographical relationship between two specific
    entities: the University of Georgia and the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences.
    However, the ambiguity arises because the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences

    question could be interpreted as asking about the location of two separate institutions
    or about the internal location within a single institution, leading to confusion.
    This makes the question ambiguous.'
  - The question asks if the University of Georgia is located east of the Franklin
    College of Arts and Sciences. However, there is ambiguity because the Franklin
    College of Arts and Sciences is actually a part of the University of Georgia,
    not a separate location. This could lead to confusion, as the question seems to
    treat them as two distinct entities. The question could be asking about their
    relative positions on the university campus or could be interpreted as asking
    about entirely different locations if not understood that Franklin College is
    part of the University. This ambiguity in the interpretation of locations leads
    to different potential answers.

    of Southern Methodist University".
  - The question asks about the geographical relationship between Meadows School of
    the Arts and Southern Methodist University, both located in Texas. However, Meadows
    School of the Arts is actually a part of Southern Methodist University. This makes
    the question ambiguous because it could be interpreted as asking about a specific
    location within the university or if it is erroneously assuming they are separate
    entities. The ambiguity arises from the phrasing, which could lead to different
    interpretations regarding the relative location of two entities that are essentially
    the same.
  - The question is asking about the geographical relationship between Meadows School
    of the Arts and Southern Methodist University, both located in Texas. The Meadows
    School of the Arts is actually part of Southern Methodist University, which could
    lead to confusion. If the question intends to ask about the location of a specific
    building or area within the university, it is not clearly stated, making the question

    However, the Ipswich Female Seminary is a historical institution that no longer
    exists, which could introduce ambiguity. If interpreted as a historical question
    regarding the past locations of these institutions, it could be clear. However,
    without specifying the timeframe or acknowledging the historical context, it could
    also be seen as ambiguous since it involves a non-existent institution.
  - The question asks if Ipswich Female Seminary in Massachusetts is located east
    of the University of New England in Maine. However, Ipswich Female Seminary is
    a historical institution that no longer exists, as it was operational in the 19th
    century. This could lead to ambiguity because the question might be interpreted
    as asking about the historical location of Ipswich Female Seminary relative to
    the current location of the University of New England. Additionally, since Ipswich
    Female Seminary no longer exists, the question may not have a current real-world
    application or answer, further contributing to its ambiguity.
  - The question asks about the geographical location of Ipswich Female Seminary in
    relation to the University of New England. However, there is an inherent ambiguity
    because Ipswich Female Seminary no longer exists as a functioning institution.
    The seminary was historically located in Ipswich, Massachusetts, but without current
    operational status, its "location" could be interpreted as either its historical
    site or as non-existent. Additionally, the phrasing "east of" could be interpreted
    based on historical locations or current geographic data, leading to potential
    confusion. This ambiguity arises because the question involves a historical institution
    that is no longer present on modern maps or as a current point of reference.
  - 'The question is asking whether Ipswich Female Seminary in Massachusetts is located
    east of the University of New England in Maine. This appears straightforward,
    but there is an issue: Ipswich Female Seminary is a historical institution that
    no longer exists as an operational college. Additionally, the question assumes
    a specific understanding of the geographical locations, which might be clear if
    both were current, recognized institutions. However, due to the historical nature
    of one institution, the interpretation becomes ambiguous, as the question might
    be interpreted as historical inquiry or geographical comparison of non-existing
    and existing institutions.'
  - The question asks about the geographical relationship between Ipswich Female Seminary
    in Massachusetts and the University of New England in Maine. Ipswich Female Seminary
    is a historical institution that no longer exists, so there is an ambiguity regarding
    whether the question refers to its historical location or if it mistakenly assumes
    the institution is still operational. Furthermore, the question does not specify
    which campus of the University of New England is being referred to, as UNE has
    multiple campuses in Maine. These factors introduce multiple interpretations of
    the question, leading to different possible answers.
  - The question asks if Ipswich Female Seminary, MA is located east of the University
    of New England, ME. To determine whether the question is clear or ambiguous, we
    need to consider the specific locations of these institutions. Ipswich Female
    Seminary was a historical institution that no longer exists, and its location
    would have been in Ipswich, Massachusetts. The University of New England is a
    current institution located in Biddeford, Maine. The question involves determining
    the geographical relationship between these two places. Since Ipswich, MA, is
    indeed located to the southwest of Biddeford, ME, geographically, the question
    can be answered definitively based on historical and current geographical data.
    Therefore, the question is asking for a specific geographic comparison that can
    be answered clearly.
  - 'The question asks whether Ipswich Female Seminary in Massachusetts is located
    east of the University of New England in Maine. To determine this, one would typically
    compare the longitudinal coordinates of the two locations. However, Ipswich Female
    Seminary is a historical institution that no longer exists as a college, adding
    ambiguity to the question. The question could be interpreted as asking about the
    historical location of the seminary relative to the present location of the University
    of New England, but this interpretation requires assumptions about the intent
    and context. Additionally, without specific coordinates or current context, the
    question could be seen as seeking historical or geographical information that
    might not be straightforward. Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation:
    it could be about historical geography, or it could be interpreted as a current
    geographical query with insufficient context.'
  - The question asks about the geographical location of Ipswich Female Seminary in
    relation to the University of New England. However, Ipswich Female Seminary is
    a historical institution that no longer exists, which could lead to confusion
    about its current location or relevance. Additionally, the question does not specify
    which campus of the University of New England is being referred to, as it has
    multiple campuses. These factors introduce ambiguity regarding both the historical
    context and the specific location in question.
  - The question is asking about the relative location of Ipswich Female Seminary,
    MA, in relation to the University of New England, ME. The question could be considered
    ambiguous because Ipswich Female Seminary is a historical institution that no
    longer exists, so its exact location might not be commonly known or might be interpreted
    differently depending on the context (historical versus current geographical understanding).
    Additionally, there could be ambiguity in how one interprets "east of" due to
    the curvature of the Earth and the specific points used for the locations. However,
    if we take the historical location of Ipswich Female Seminary and the current
    location of the University of New England, the question could be answered based
    on geographical coordinates.

  - 'The question asks about the relative location of two universities within California:
    Apple University, CA and California South Bay University, CA. The term "east of"
    is a clear directional query. However, the ambiguity arises because "Apple University,
    CA" is not a widely recognized institution, and its location is unclear without
    additional context. Furthermore, there might be multiple institutions with similar
    names or fictional names, leading to uncertainty about which specific locations
    the question refers to. Therefore, the question can be interpreted in multiple
    ways based on different assumptions about the existence and location of "Apple
    University, CA."'
  - The question asks if "Apple University, CA" is located east of "California South
    Bay University, CA." The ambiguity arises because "Apple University, CA" is not
    a well-known institution, and it may not exist, leading to multiple interpretations
    regarding its location. Additionally, the lack of specific geographic markers
    or coordinates makes it difficult to determine relative locations without additional
    context or assumptions. Thus, the question admits more than one interpretation
    depending on assumptions about the existence and location of "Apple University,
    CA."
  - 'The question asks about the relative location of two entities: Apple University,
    CA, and California South Bay University, CA. However, there is ambiguity in this
    question because "Apple University" is not a well-known or commonly recognized

    without specific addresses or known locations for both entities, it is impossible
    to definitively determine their relative positions to each other. This lack of
    clarity in the entities'' locations leads to multiple possible interpretations
    and answers.'
  - This question is asking about the geographical location of two entities, Apple
    University and California South Bay University, both of which are presumably in
    California. The ambiguity arises because "Apple University" is not a widely recognized
    or established institution, making it unclear if it actually exists or where it
    is located. Additionally, without precise locations or definitions of these universities,
    it's impossible to determine if one is east of the other. Furthermore, the question
    does not specify what is meant by "east" (e.g., in terms of longitude, relative
    to a map view, etc.). This lack of clarity regarding the existence and location
    of Apple University and the specific interpretation of "east" makes the question
    ambiguous.
  - The question asks about the relative location of two universities, Apple University,
    CA and California South Bay University, CA. The ambiguity arises from the fact
    that "Apple University" might not be a well-known or recognized institution, and
    its location isn't clear. Furthermore, without specific geographic coordinates
    or a map reference, the relative positioning between the two universities cannot
    be definitively determined. Additionally, the question does not specify which
    "east" direction is meant, whether it's based on a specific geographic orientation
    or another reference point. Therefore, the question is open to multiple interpretations
    and cannot be answered definitively without additional information.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographic location of two entities:
    Apple University, CA and California South Bay University, CA. The ambiguity arises
    because "Apple University" is not a widely recognized or well-documented institution,
    and its exact location might not be known or could refer to different things.
    Additionally, the term "east of" requires precise geographic coordinates to determine
    the relative position, which could vary based on different interpretations of
    where these institutions are located. Without clear, specific information on the
    existence and location of Apple University, the question admits multiple interpretations
    and cannot be answered definitively.'

    impossible to determine whether it is east of California South Bay University,
    CA. Additionally, the reference to "California South Bay University, CA" is unclear,
    as there is no well-known institution by that name, which adds to the ambiguity.
    Without clear identification and established locations of these institutions,
    the question admits more than one interpretation regarding their geographical
    relation.'
  - The question is asking about the geographical location of two institutions in
    California. However, there is ambiguity because "Apple University" could refer
    to a fictional or lesser-known entity, and without specific knowledge of such
    an institution's existence and location, multiple interpretations are possible.
    Furthermore, without clear details about the exact location of "California South
    Bay University," the question could lead to different answers depending on assumptions
    made about these institutions' locations.
  - The question asks about the relative location of two entities, Apple University,
    CA and California South Bay University, CA. The interpretation depends on whether
    these institutions are real and have known locations. Since "Apple University"
    is not a real university with a known campus location, and there could be multiple
    interpretations about what "California South Bay University" refers to (since
    it is not a widely recognized institution), the question admits more than one
    interpretation. Without clear definitions or known locations for these institutions,
    different answers could be provided based on assumptions.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative location of two entities: Apple University,
    CA and California South Bay University, CA. However, "Apple University, CA" does
    not appear to be a widely recognized or real institution, which introduces ambiguity.
    Additionally, without clear geographic markers or known locations for these entities,
    determining which is east of the other is impossible. Therefore, the question
    admits more than one interpretation: it could be a hypothetical question, a question
    about real but obscure places, or simply based on incorrect premises. Each interpretation
    could lead to different answers based on assumptions made about the locations
    in question.'

  - The question is asking whether Northcentral University, located in Arizona, is
    situated east of Wilkes University, also located in Mesa, Arizona. However, the
    question incorrectly states "Wilkes University, Mesa, AZ" which could be misleading
    because Wilkes University is primarily located in Pennsylvania, though it may
    have an extension or a location in Mesa, Arizona. This creates ambiguity about
    the location being referred to. Additionally, Northcentral University is also
    based in Scottsdale, Arizona, and not specifically noted as being in Mesa. The
    geographical interpretation of "east" also depends on specific coordinates, which
    are not provided. These factors contribute to multiple interpretations of the
    question, leading to potential confusion over the exact locations being compared.
  - 'The question is asking about the geographic location of two institutions: Northcentral
    University, AZ, and Wilkes University, Mesa, AZ. However, it presents an ambiguity
    because "Wilkes University, Mesa, AZ" may be mistakenly identified. Wilkes University
    is originally based in Pennsylvania, but it has a campus in Mesa, AZ. The question
    could be interpreted as asking about the main campus of Wilkes University or its
    Mesa campus. Additionally, Northcentral University is primarily an online institution
    headquartered in San Diego, California, with administrative offices in Scottsdale,
    AZ, which might lead to confusion. Therefore, the question could have different
    interpretations based on these ambiguities, leading to multiple possible answers.'
  - "The question asks whether Northcentral University, AZ is located east of Wilkes\
    \ University, Mesa, AZ. However, there is ambiguity in the question due to the\
    \ following reasons: \n\n1. Northcentral University is primarily an online university\
    \ with administrative functions in San Diego, CA, rather than a physical campus\
    \ in Arizona. This makes it unclear what specific location in AZ is being referred\
    \ to.\n2. Wilkes University has a campus in Mesa, AZ, but without a specific reference\
    \ to a location for Northcentral University, it's difficult to accurately determine\
    \ the relative east/west positioning between the two.\n\nBecause of these ambiguities\
    \ in the specific locations being referenced, the question could lead to different\
    \ interpretations and answers. Therefore, the question is AMBIGUOUS."
  - The question asks whether Northcentral University, AZ is located east of Wilkes
    University, Mesa, AZ. It implies that both institutions are in Arizona (AZ), which
    is incorrect because Northcentral University is based in San Diego, California,
    and Wilkes University has a location in Mesa, Arizona. Additionally, the phrase
    "east of" can be interpreted in terms of longitudinal position, but since Northcentral
    University is not in Arizona, the premise of the question is flawed. Given these
    factors, the question admits more than one interpretation and can lead to different
    answers depending on the assumptions made about the locations of the universities.
  - The question is asking whether Northcentral University in Arizona is located east
    of Wilkes University in Mesa, Arizona. However, there is ambiguity because Northcentral
    University is primarily based in San Diego, California, and its presence in Arizona
    is not clearly defined. Additionally, "Wilkes University, Mesa, AZ" could refer
    to a branch or specific program, but Wilkes University is originally based in
    Pennsylvania. The question assumes that both institutions have definitive, singular
    locations in Arizona, which is not necessarily accurate. This could lead to multiple
    interpretations regarding the exact locations being referred to in Arizona.
  - The question asks about the geographical location of Northcentral University in
    relation to Wilkes University in Mesa, AZ. However, there is a fundamental ambiguity
    because Northcentral University is primarily an online institution with administrative
    offices in multiple locations, and its main administrative office is not in Arizona.
    Additionally, Wilkes University is based in Pennsylvania, but it has a location
    in Mesa, AZ, which adds to the confusion. Therefore, the question can be interpreted
    in different ways based on these aspects, leading to different answers.
  - The question asks about the geographical location of Northcentral University in
    relation to Wilkes University, both of which are specified to be in Arizona. However,
    Northcentral University is actually based in San Diego, California, and Wilkes
    University does not have a campus in Mesa, AZ; it is based in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.
    This creates ambiguity as the locations mentioned in the question do not accurately
    represent the institutions' actual locations. Additionally, the phrasing "east
    of" could refer to a general direction or a precise longitudinal comparison, adding
    further ambiguity.
  - The question asks if Northcentral University, AZ is located east of Wilkes University,
    Mesa, AZ. However, there is an ambiguity in the locations mentioned. Northcentral
    University is based in San Diego, California, and not in Arizona, which creates
    confusion. Furthermore, Wilkes University is originally based in Pennsylvania,
    but it has a campus in Mesa, AZ. The question assumes both institutions are in
    Arizona, which is incorrect, leading to multiple interpretations regarding their
    locations. Therefore, the question is ambiguous because of the incorrect geographical
    assumptions and the potential for multiple interpretations based on these misunderstandings.
  - The question is asking whether Northcentral University, AZ is located east of
    Wilkes University, Mesa, AZ. However, there is an ambiguity in the phrasing of
    the question. "Wilkes University, Mesa, AZ" might be interpreted as a branch of
    Wilkes University located in Mesa, AZ. However, Wilkes University is primarily
    based in Pennsylvania, and it's not commonly known to have a campus in Mesa, AZ.
    This could lead to confusion about the geographical locations being referenced,
    making it unclear whether the question is comparing locations in Arizona or involving
    an institution primarily located in another state. Thus, the question can be interpreted
    in more than one way due to the potential misunderstanding of the institutions'
    locations.
  - The question is asking about the relative geographic location of Northcentral
    University in Arizona and Wilkes University in Mesa, Arizona. The use of "east
    of" implies a specific direction on a map. However, there is potential ambiguity
    because Northcentral University is primarily an online institution headquartered
    in San Diego, California, and may not have a physical campus in Arizona. Additionally,
    Wilkes University has an extension in Mesa, Arizona, but its main campus is in
    Pennsylvania. The question does not specify whether it is referring to the physical
    locations of specific campuses or headquarters, leading to multiple interpretations
    of which locations to compare.

  - The question asks whether South University in Georgia is located east of Ralston
    College in Georgia. This question appears to be straightforward, as it is asking
    for a geographical comparison between the locations of two specific institutions.
    Assuming that both institutions are correctly identified by their names and the
    state they are located in, the question should have a clear answer based on geographical
    data. However, if there is any ambiguity about the locations of these colleges
    (e.g., if there are multiple campuses or if the names are not unique), this could
    introduce ambiguity. Given only the information presented in the question, without
    further context, the interpretation seems straightforward.
  - The question asks about the geographical location of South University in relation
    to Ralston College, both presumably in Georgia (GA). The interpretation hinges
    on the assumption that both institutions are indeed located in Georgia. However,
    the ambiguity arises because there could be multiple campuses or locations associated
    with "South University" and "Ralston College," and the question does not specify
    which particular campuses or addresses are being referred to. This could lead
    to different answers depending on the interpretation of which specific locations
    are being compared.
  - The question asks whether South University in Georgia is located east of Ralston
    College in Georgia. To determine if this question is clear or ambiguous, we need
    to assess whether the locations of both institutions are well-defined and widely
    recognized. South University has a known location, but Ralston College does not
    have a widely established physical location as it is an educational project rather
    than a traditional college with a campus. This makes the question ambiguous because
    the interpretation of "Ralston College, GA" can vary, leading to different possible
    answers regarding its geographic relation to South University.
  - The question asks about the relative geographic location of South University,
    GA, in relation to Ralston College, GA. This question is potentially ambiguous
    because it assumes specific, identifiable locations for both institutions. If
    there are multiple campuses or if the locations of the colleges are not well-known
    or easily verifiable, the question could lead to different interpretations. Additionally,
    without specific geographic coordinates or detailed maps, "east" could be interpreted
    differently depending on the scale or context used. Without clear, singular definitions
    or locations for both institutions, the question admits more than one interpretation.
  - 'The question asks about the geographical location of South University in relation
    to Ralston College, both presumably in Georgia (GA), USA. To determine if the
    question is clear or ambiguous, we need to consider the following:


    1. The question assumes the existence of both "South University, GA" and "Ralston
    College, GA."

    2. If there are known locations for both institutions, the question is straightforward
    and can be answered by comparing their longitudinal coordinates or general geographical
    knowledge.

    3. If either or both institutions are not well-defined, or if there are multiple
    campuses or locations for either institution, this could lead to ambiguity.


    Given that the question does not specify the exact campuses or locations and relies
    on the assumption that these institutions are commonly recognized with clear locations,
    without further context or specificity, the question could be interpreted in more
    than one way, especially if there are multiple campuses or if either institution
    is not widely recognized.


    Thus, the question is ambiguous due to potential uncertainties about the specific
    locations being referred to.'
  - The question asks about the geographical location of South University, GA in relation
    to Ralston College, GA. This seems straightforward as it involves determining
    the cardinal direction (east) between two specific locations in Georgia. However,
    the ambiguity arises because "South University, GA" and "Ralston College, GA"
    could refer to multiple campuses or locations within Georgia if there are multiple
    institutions or branches with similar names. Without specific addresses or further
    context, the question could be interpreted differently depending on which campuses
    are being considered. Therefore, the question could lead to different answers
    based on these interpretations.
  - The question asks if South University, GA is located east of Ralston College,
    GA. This question could be classified as AMBIGUOUS because it requires specific
    geographic knowledge and assumes both institutions are well-known and have fixed,
    identifiable locations. Additionally, without specific addresses or coordinates,
    there could be multiple interpretations of what constitutes "east," especially
    if either institution has multiple campuses or if there's any ambiguity in their
    locations within Georgia.
  - The question asks about the relative location of South University, GA, in relation
    to Ralston College, GA. To determine if the question is clear or ambiguous, we
    need to consider whether the locations of these institutions are well-defined
    and universally recognized. South University and Ralston College might have multiple
    campuses or branches, or there might be multiple institutions with similar names.
    Without specific addresses or known locations, the question could be interpreted
    in different ways, leading to different answers depending on which campuses or
    branches are considered. Thus, the question admits more than one interpretation,
    making it ambiguous.
  - 'The question asks about the geographical location of South University in relation
    to Ralston College, both presumably in Georgia (GA). The question seems straightforward,
    asking if one is east of the other. However, there are potential ambiguities:


    1. There might be multiple campuses or locations for these institutions, which
    could lead to different interpretations depending on which locations are being
    referenced.

    2. Without specific addresses or coordinates, determining the exact eastern position
    could be ambiguous.

    3. The names "South University" and "Ralston College" might refer to different
    institutions in various contexts, leading to ambiguity about which specific institutions
    are being compared.


    Given these potential sources of ambiguity, the question could admit more than
    one interpretation and lead to different answers depending on the context or additional
    information provided.'
  - The question asks whether South University in Georgia is located east of Ralston
    College in Georgia. The question seems straightforward as it asks for a geographic

  - The question is asking for a geographical comparison between the locations of
    the Naval Postgraduate School and Tri-Valley University in California. The direction
    "east" is a specific geographic term, and the question implies a straightforward
    comparison of the two locations on a map. However, the question could be considered
    ambiguous because it doesn't specify which aspect of the institutions (main campuses,
    specific departments, etc.) should be compared if they have multiple locations.
    Additionally, the reference to "Tri-Valley University" could be problematic, as
    it was an unaccredited institution that closed, which may lead to confusion about
    its exact location. Despite these potential ambiguities, the primary interpretation
    seems to focus on the main campuses or known locations of these institutions.
  - The question is asking whether the Naval Postgraduate School in California is
    located east of Tri-Valley University in California. This question can be interpreted
    in a straightforward geographic context, where one would determine the longitudinal
    positions of both institutions to see which one is further east. However, the
    question assumes knowledge of both the exact locations of these institutions and
    the possibility that there may be more than one campus or location associated
    with either name. Despite this, the question primarily revolves around a geographic
    fact that can be resolved by checking a map for the longitudinal coordinates of
    the specific main campuses of each institution. Thus, the question admits only
    one interpretation in terms of geographic location.
  - 'The question is asking for a geographical comparison between two locations: the

    refer to a different entity or have changed its status over time, leading to potential
    ambiguity in identifying its exact location. Without a clear, established location
    for Tri-Valley University, the question could lead to different interpretations
    regarding which entities are being compared and where they are located.'
  - 'The question is asking about the relative location of two institutions: the Naval
    Postgraduate School and Tri-Valley University, both in California. The question

  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographical locations of two institutions
    in California: the Naval Postgraduate School and Tri-Valley University. It appears
    to be a straightforward question about their locations. However, the question
    is ambiguous because "east of" can depend on the specific points of reference
    used for each institution. Additionally, Tri-Valley University does not have a
    widely recognized physical campus, as it was involved in a visa fraud scheme and
    was not a legitimate educational institution. This adds further ambiguity because
    without a specific and legitimate location for Tri-Valley University, the question
    cannot be definitively answered.'
  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographical location of two institutions
    in California: the Naval Postgraduate School and Tri-Valley University. To determine
    if the question is CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS, we need to consider if there is only one
    way to interpret the location comparison.


    The Naval Postgraduate School is located in Monterey, CA. However, Tri-Valley
    University is a defunct institution that was once located in Pleasanton, CA. The
    question asks if the Naval Postgraduate School is "east of" Tri-Valley University.
    This is a straightforward geographical question, as "east of" is a clear directional
    term that does not have multiple interpretations. Therefore, the question has
    one clear interpretation and can be answered by comparing the longitudinal coordinates
    of Monterey and Pleasanton.


    Since Monterey is located west of Pleasanton, the answer to the question is "No,
    the Naval Postgraduate School is not located east of Tri-Valley University."


    Thus, the question admits only one interpretation and has one correct answer.'
  - The question asks whether the Naval Postgraduate School in California is located
    east of Tri-Valley University in California. This requires determining the geographical
    positions of both institutions relative to each other. The question is clear in

    which is a single interpretation. Therefore, it admits one interpretation and
    one correct answer based on the geographic locations of the two institutions.
  - The question asks about the geographical location of the Naval Postgraduate School
    in relation to Tri-Valley University within California. The interpretation hinges
    on the physical locations of these two institutions. The Naval Postgraduate School
    is located in Monterey, CA, while Tri-Valley University was based in Pleasanton,
    CA. Since Monterey is south of Pleasanton, the question is straightforward in
    terms of geographical direction and can be answered definitively based on their
    locations. Therefore, the question does not admit more than one interpretation.
  - 'The question is asking about the relative location of two institutions in California:
    the Naval Postgraduate School and Tri-Valley University. The question appears
    to be straightforward as it involves determining the geographical orientation
    (east or not) between two fixed locations. However, there is potential ambiguity
    due to the existence of multiple "Tri-Valley" regions in California, which might
    lead to different interpretations regarding the specific location of Tri-Valley
    University, CA. Without specifying the exact location or address of Tri-Valley
    University, the question admits more than one interpretation depending on which
    "Tri-Valley" is considered.'
  - 'The question is asking about the relative geographical location of two specific
    institutions within California: the Naval Postgraduate School and Tri-Valley University.
    The Naval Postgraduate School is located in Monterey, CA. Tri-Valley University,
    however, is known to have been a fraudulent institution and does not have a clear,
    legitimate location. Due to the lack of a specific, recognized location for Tri-Valley
    University, the question is ambiguous because it is not possible to definitively
    determine if the Naval Postgraduate School is east of Tri-Valley University when
    the latter''s location is unclear or non-existent.'
