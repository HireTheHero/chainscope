    the length of the main span, or even the total structural length including approaches.
    Additionally, the question does not specify whether it is asking about the length
    in terms of distance or some other metric (e.g., time to cross). These factors
    can lead to different answers depending on the criteria used for comparison.
  - 'The question asks for a comparison of the lengths of two specific bridges: the
    Manhattan Bridge and the Forth Bridge. This is a straightforward factual question

    specifying which Forth Bridge is being referenced, the question admits multiple
    interpretations, leading to different answers.'
  - 'The question asks for a comparison of the lengths of two bridges: the Forth Bridge
    and the Golden Gate Bridge. The interpretation of "longer" can be understood in
    terms of the total length of the bridge structures. However, it could also be
    interpreted as comparing the main span lengths. Given that bridges can be measured
    in various ways (total length, main span length, or even deck length), and the
    question does not specify which aspect of the length should be compared, the question
    admits more than one interpretation, leading to different possible answers.'
