  - The question asks whether Tubac, AZ is more populous than Brickerville, PA. The
    question is clear in its intent, seeking a comparison of the populations of two
    specific locations. However, it is ambiguous because it assumes that both places
    have populations that are commonly known or comparable, which may not be the case.
    Tubac, AZ is a census-designated place, while Brickerville, PA is an unincorporated
    community. The lack of clear population data for Brickerville could lead to different
    interpretations or difficulty in providing a definitive answer.
  - 'The question is asking for a comparison between the populations of two specific
    locations: Tubac, AZ, and Brickerville, PA. The question is straightforward in
    its request for a factual comparison based on population size. However, the ambiguity
    arises from the nature of the locations being compared. Tubac is a census-designated
    place, while Brickerville is an unincorporated community. The definition and boundaries
    of such places may vary, leading to potential differences in how population data
    is reported. Moreover, if one were to consider surrounding areas or differing
    definitions of what constitutes the "city" area, it might lead to different interpretations
    of the population figures. Thus, the question can admit more than one interpretation
    based on these nuances.'

  - 'The question asks whether Slippery Rock University in Pennsylvania is more populous
    than Bluewell, West Virginia. The question compares the population of a university
    with a town, which is an unconventional comparison and may lead to different interpretations:
    1) It could mean comparing the student population of the university with the population
    of Bluewell, or 2) it could mean comparing the population of the town where the
    university is located with Bluewell. Since the question does not specify what
    aspect of the university''s population is being compared, it leads to ambiguity.'
  - The question is asking for a comparison of the population between Slippery Rock
    University in Pennsylvania and Bluewell, West Virginia. However, the question
    is ambiguous because it compares a university, which is an institution and does
    not have a population in the same sense as a city or town, to a census-designated
    place, Bluewell. This could lead to different interpretations regarding whether
    the question is asking about the student population, faculty, or some other measure
    at the university compared to the population of Bluewell. Additionally, the question
    does not specify the context of "more populous" clearly, leading to potential
    multiple interpretations.
  - The question is asking whether Slippery Rock University, located in Pennsylvania,
    is more populous than Bluewell, West Virginia. The ambiguity arises from the fact
    that Slippery Rock University is not a city; it is an institution. The question
    could be interpreted as asking about the population of the university community
    or the town of Slippery Rock, PA, itself, compared to Bluewell, WV. This leads
    to different interpretations and potentially different answers based on what is
    being compared to Bluewell, WV.
  - The question asks whether Slippery Rock University, PA is more populous than Bluewell,
    WV. The ambiguity arises from the mention of "Slippery Rock University, PA," which
    could refer to the university itself or the town of Slippery Rock, PA, where the
    university is located. Since the university is an institution and typically not
    compared in population to towns or cities, this could lead to confusion. Additionally,
    if the question intends to compare the population of the university's student
    body to the population of Bluewell, WV, this interpretation would also differ.
    Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation, leading to different
    answers.
  - The question asks whether Slippery Rock University, PA is more populous than Bluewell,
    WV. The ambiguity arises from comparing a university to a town, as they are inherently
    different entities. If the intent is to compare the population of the university's
    campus to the population of Bluewell, or the population of the town where the
    university is located to Bluewell, these are different interpretations and could
    lead to different answers. Without clarification, it's unclear which comparison
    is intended.
  - The question asks for a comparison between the population of Slippery Rock University,
    PA, and Bluewell, WV. The ambiguity arises from the fact that Slippery Rock University
    is an educational institution, not a city or town, while Bluewell is a census-designated
    place. The question could be interpreted as asking for the population of the university's
    campus (which isn't typically a population measure) versus the town, or it could
    be looking for the population of Slippery Rock, the town in which the university
    is located. These different interpretations could lead to different answers.
  - This question is ambiguous because it involves a comparison between a university
    and a city. Slippery Rock University is an educational institution, not a city,
    whereas Bluewell, WV is a community. The comparison should be between similarly
    categorized entities, such as between two cities or two universities, to have
    a clear interpretation and answer.
  - The question asks for a comparison of population between Slippery Rock University
    in Pennsylvania and Bluewell, West Virginia. The ambiguity arises because Slippery
    Rock University is an educational institution, not a city or town, while Bluewell
    is a census-designated place. The question could be interpreted as asking for
    the population of the university's student body compared to the population of
    Bluewell, or it could be mistakenly asking for a comparison of two towns or cities.
    This leads to different possible interpretations and answers.
  - The question asks whether Slippery Rock University in Pennsylvania is more populous
    than Bluewell, West Virginia. This question is ambiguous because it involves comparing
    a university (which is not a city or a typical population entity) with a town.
    The population of a university typically refers to the number of students, faculty,
    and staff, while the population of a town refers to its residents. These are different
    types of entities, and comparing their populations without further context or
    clarification could lead to different interpretations.
  - The question compares the population of Slippery Rock University, PA, with that
    of Bluewell, WV. The ambiguity arises because Slippery Rock University is not
    a city, but an educational institution, whereas Bluewell is a census-designated
    place. The question may be intended to compare the population of the university
    campus or its student body with the population of Bluewell, WV. Since it's unclear
    whether the comparison is between the university's student population or the geographical
    location where the university is situated and Bluewell, the question admits more
    than one interpretation.

    This can be answered with population data, and there is no ambiguity in the request
    for a comparison between these two specific locations.'
  - The question asks whether Brookside, DE is more populous than East Cleveland,
    OH. On the surface, it seems straightforward, comparing the populations of two
    specific locations. However, the ambiguity arises from the fact that "Brookside,
    DE" and "East Cleveland, OH" might not be universally recognized or might refer
    to different areas depending on context (e.g., census-designated places versus
    broader metropolitan areas). Without specific definitions of the geographic boundaries
    or contexts of these locations, the question could lead to different interpretations
    of what exactly is being compared.
  - The question asks whether Brookside, Delaware is more populous than East Cleveland,
    Ohio. While it seems straightforward, it is ambiguous because the population data
    could vary depending on the source or the year of the data. Additionally, there
    might be confusion about which Brookside is being referred to, as multiple places
    with the same name could exist in different states. However, given the specific
    mention of "DE" and "OH," it is likely referring to those specific locations.
    Nonetheless, the potential for variability in data and interpretation of what
    constitutes "more populous" (e.g., based on the latest census, estimates, etc.)
    makes this question ambiguous.
  - 'The question is asking for a comparison between the populations of Brookside,
    DE, and East Cleveland, OH. The question is clear in its intent, as it specifies

  - The question asks whether White Horse, NJ is more populous than Bardmoor, FL.
    While the question seems straightforward, it is ambiguous due to the lack of specificity
    about the time frame or the source of population data. Population figures can
    change over time, and different sources might provide slightly different numbers.
    Without specifying the year or source of the population data, the question could
    lead to different interpretations and answers. Furthermore, White Horse could
    refer to a census-designated place or an unincorporated community, which adds
    another layer of ambiguity. Thus, the question admits more than one interpretation.
  - 'The question is asking for a comparison of the populations of two specific locations:
    White Horse, NJ, and Bardmoor, FL. The query is straightforward in seeking a single
    piece of information: which of the two is more populous. While the question is
    clear in its request, it could be considered ambiguous because it presupposes
    that both locations are well-defined and that population data is readily available
    for comparison. If there were multiple places named White Horse in NJ or Bardmoor
    in FL, or if the population data was not easily accessible or outdated, this could
    complicate the answer. However, assuming the places are unique and data is available,
    the question itself remains clear in its intent.'

    or source for the population data, the question could lead to different interpretations.
    Thus, the question could be considered ambiguous due to the potential for multiple
    interpretations regarding the specifics of the locations and the time frame of
    the population data.
  - 'The question asks for a population comparison between two specific locations:

    could be interpreted in multiple ways. Additionally, there may be different sources
    or estimates of population data, which could provide different answers. Therefore,
    the question admits more than one interpretation and could lead to different answers
    depending on the time frame or data source considered.

    NJ" is typically known as a neighborhood or a section within a township rather
    than an independent city. Without clear definitions or boundaries, the population
    comparison could vary depending on how these locations are interpreted or defined
    for the purpose of obtaining population statistics. Additionally, the source and
    date of the population data could affect the answer. Thus, the question could
    lead to different answers based on these interpretations.

  - The question asks for a comparison of the population sizes between Gantt, SC,
    and Bradley Gardens, NJ. It is straightforward as it seeks a specific factual
    answer about population numbers. However, the question could be considered ambiguous
    because "Gantt, SC" and "Bradley Gardens, NJ" might refer to different types of
    places (e.g., Gantt could refer to a census-designated place or a neighborhood,
    and Bradley Gardens could be a neighborhood within a larger township). Additionally,
    population figures can change over time, so the question might be interpreted
    as asking for current data or for data from a specific year. Despite these considerations,
    the question is primarily seeking a factual comparison, so it is more clear than
    ambiguous.
  - The question asks whether Gantt, SC is more populous than Bradley Gardens, NJ.
    The question could be considered AMBIGUOUS because it does not specify a particular

    because "Gantt, SC" could refer to different census-designated places or unincorporated
    communities with similar names, and "Bradley Gardens, NJ" might not be a well-defined
    or widely recognized entity in terms of population statistics. Additionally, populations
    change over time, and without specifying a particular year or data source, the
    question can lead to different answers based on the data used. Therefore, the
    question admits more than one interpretation and could lead to different answers
    depending on these variables.
  - The question is asking for a population comparison between Gantt, SC, and Bradley
    Gardens, NJ. However, there is ambiguity in the question because it is not specified
    which Gantt (there are multiple places named Gantt in the US) or which time frame

    might not be well-known, which could lead to confusion about their locations or
    the need for specific definitions of the areas being compared.
  - 'The question asks for a comparison between the populations of two specific locations:

  - 'The question asks whether Randall, MN is more populous than Alex, OK. The question
    is specific in terms of what it is asking: a comparison of population sizes between
    two explicitly named locations. However, the potential ambiguity arises from the
    possibility that there could be multiple places named Randall or Alex within the
    United States. Nevertheless, the question does specify the states (MN for Randall
    and OK for Alex), which helps narrow it down to a single interpretation. Assuming
    that Randall, MN and Alex, OK are unique locations within their respective states,
    the question can be interpreted clearly as a straightforward population comparison.'
  - 'The question asks whether Randall, MN is more populous than Alex, OK. This appears
    to be a straightforward comparison between the populations of two specific locations.
    However, the potential issue lies in the identification of the cities: Randall,
    MN could refer to a small city or town in Minnesota, and Alex, OK might be referring
    to a place in Oklahoma. If these names are not commonly recognized or if there
    are multiple places with similar names, this could introduce ambiguity. However,
    assuming the question is about specific known places, it primarily seeks a factual
    comparison of population sizes, which typically has a clear answer based on census
    or population data.'
  - The question asks whether Randall, MN is more populous than Alex, OK. The question
    provides specific locations and seeks a comparison of population size. However,
    the ambiguity arises from the potential existence of multiple places named Randall
    or Alex within the United States, and it is unclear if the question is referring
    to cities, towns, or other types of populated areas. Without additional context
    or clarification on which Randall or Alex is being referred to, the question can
    lead to different interpretations and answers.
  - The question asks whether Randall, MN is more populous than Alex, OK. The question
    is specific in comparing the population sizes of two particular locations. However,
    the ambiguity arises from the fact that population data can change over time,
    and without a specific date or year, the question could be interpreted differently
    depending on when it is being asked. This lack of temporal specificity makes it
    ambiguous, as the answer could vary with different population data sources or
    updates.
  - 'The question compares the populations of two specific locations: Randall, MN
    and Alex, OK. The question is clear in its intent, as it seeks to determine which
    of the two locations has a larger population. However, the question assumes the
    existence and recognition of these locations, and the answer depends on factual
    population data. The interpretation is straightforward, as it does not present
    any inherent ambiguity in terms of what is being asked.'
  - The question asks whether Randall, MN is more populous than Alex, OK. While it
    seems straightforward, the ambiguity arises from the potential for multiple interpretations
    regarding the specific time frame or data source for population figures. Without
    specifying when or according to which data source the populations should be compared,
    the question could lead to different answers. Additionally, "Randall, MN" and
    "Alex, OK" could refer to different places if not clarified, though this is less
    likely. Therefore, the lack of context about the time or data source makes the
    question ambiguous.
  - 'The question asks whether Randall, MN is more populous than Alex, OK. This question
    seems to be straightforward as it requests a comparison between the populations
    of two specific locations: Randall in Minnesota and Alex in Oklahoma. However,
    there might be ambiguity due to the fact that "Randall, MN" could refer to a township
    or a city, and similarly "Alex, OK" might have different interpretations depending
    on whether it refers to a city or another type of settlement. The specific entities
    being compared need to be clearly defined to provide an accurate answer. Since
    the question could lead to different interpretations based on the definitions
    of "Randall, MN" and "Alex, OK", it is classified as ambiguous.'
  - 'The question asks whether the city of Randall in Minnesota is more populous than
    the city of Alex in Oklahoma. The question is clear in its intent to compare the

    data.'
  - 'The question asks whether Randall, MN is more populous than Alex, OK. It is clear
    in its intention, seeking a straightforward comparison of population sizes between
    two specific locations. The interpretation is singular: it requires demographic
    data to determine which city has a larger population. Thus, the question admits
    one interpretation and aims for one correct answer based on population statistics.'
  - The question asks whether Randall, MN is more populous than Alex, OK. The question
    seems straightforward at first glance, as it compares the populations of two specific
    cities. However, it is ambiguous for several reasons. First, the names "Randall"
    and "Alex" could potentially refer to multiple places, especially since they are
    not commonly known cities. This could lead to different interpretations depending
    on which specific locations the person is thinking of. Additionally, population
    data can vary depending on the source and the year it was collected. Without a
    specific data source or year, there could be different answers based on different
    datasets. Therefore, the question is open to multiple interpretations and could
    lead to different answers.

  - The question asks whether Thruston, KY is more populous than Effort, PA. This
    appears to be a straightforward comparison of population sizes between two specific
    locations. However, it is ambiguous for several reasons. Firstly, Thruston, KY
    and Effort, PA might not be widely recognized places, and their population data
    might not be readily available or could vary based on different sources or definitions
    of city boundaries. Secondly, the names of the places might be mistaken or misinterpreted,
    leading to confusion about what specific locations are being referred to. Finally,
    the question assumes that these locations are comparable in terms of being cities,
    which might not be the case if one or both are unincorporated communities or different
    types of administrative regions.
  - The question asks about the population comparison between two locations, Thruston,
    KY, and Effort, PA. However, there is ambiguity in the question because Thruston
    and Effort might not be well-known cities, and their population data might not
    be readily available. Additionally, if either location does not have an official
    population count or if there are multiple places with the same name, it could
    lead to different interpretations or answers.
  - 'The question is asking for a comparison of the population sizes of two places:
    Thruston, KY and Effort, PA. However, the question is ambiguous for a couple of
    reasons: 1) The names Thruston and Effort might refer to neighborhoods, towns,
    or other types of settlements, and without additional context, it is unclear if
    they are referring to the same type of entity. 2) The populations of these places
    can change over time, so the time frame of the population data being compared
    is not specified. Due to these factors, the question admits more than one interpretation,
    leading to different possible answers depending on the assumptions made.'
  - The question asks whether Thruston, KY is more populous than Effort, PA. The question
    is straightforward in that it seeks a comparison of population sizes between two
    specific locations. However, the ambiguity arises from the fact that Thruston,
    KY is not a well-known city, and Effort, PA is actually a village in Pennsylvania.
    Additionally, the question does not specify which particular population metric
    should be considered (e.g., city limits, metropolitan area). Therefore, without
    additional context, the question could be considered ambiguous due to potential
    confusion about the locations and the exact population metrics being compared.
  - This question is AMBIGUOUS because it asks about the population comparison between
    two places, Thruston, KY and Effort, PA, but there are several factors that contribute
    to the ambiguity. Firstly, the question assumes the existence of both places without
    verifying their status as cities or towns. Secondly, it does not specify the time
    frame for the population data being referenced, which is crucial for answering
    questions about population since it can change over time. Additionally, if either
    of these locations does not exist or is not recognized as a distinct population
    center, it would be impossible to provide a definitive answer.
  - The question is AMBIGUOUS because it asks whether Thruston, KY is more populous
    than Effort, PA. However, there is no clear or well-known information available
    about the population sizes of these specific places, and they may not be officially
    recognized as cities. Furthermore, the comparison involves locations that might
    not have readily available or comparable data, which could lead to different interpretations
    of what constitutes a city or how population should be measured.
  - 'The question asks for a comparison of population sizes between two locations:
    Thruston, KY, and Effort, PA. However, it is ambiguous because "Thruston, KY"
    and "Effort, PA" are not widely recognized as major cities, and their status as
    cities or towns is unclear. The question does not specify the context or source
    of population data, which could vary. Additionally, without a standardized definition
    or source for what constitutes "more populous," different interpretations or sources
    could lead to different answers.'
  - The question asks whether Thruston, KY is more populous than Effort, PA. However,
    it is ambiguous because there is no widely recognized city named "Effort" in Pennsylvania.
    Furthermore, Thruston is not a city but an unincorporated community in Kentucky.
    Due to these factors, the question admits multiple interpretations, such as questioning
    the existence of these places or assuming they are places other than cities. This
    ambiguity could lead to different answers based on the interpretation of the entities
    involved.
  - The question asks about the population comparison between Thruston, KY and Effort,
    PA. However, the question is ambiguous because it assumes the existence of both
    places as cities, and there may be uncertainty about the current population data

  - The question asks about the population comparison between Dorr, MI and County
    Center, VA. However, it is ambiguous because "County Center, VA" does not correspond
    to a well-defined or commonly recognized city or census-designated place. It could
    refer to an administrative or commercial center within a county, which is not
    specific enough for a clear comparison. Additionally, the lack of specific data
    or context for these locations makes it impossible to provide a definitive answer.
    Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation regarding the location
    and could lead to different answers depending on the interpretation of "County
    Center, VA."
  - The question asks whether Dorr, MI is more populous than County Center, VA. While
    the question seems straightforward, it is actually ambiguous due to the lack of
    clarity about "County Center, VA." There is no widely recognized place known as
    "County Center" in Virginia, which could mean it refers to a local government
    office, a non-incorporated area, or simply a generic term for a central county
    location. Without further specification, the comparison cannot be made accurately,
    leading to multiple interpretations and potential answers.
  - 'The question is asking for a comparison of population sizes between two locations:
    Dorr, MI, and County Center, VA. However, there is some ambiguity here. Firstly,
    Dorr is a community in Michigan, but it''s not a city; it''s part of a larger
    township. County Center, VA, isn''t a standard name for a city or town, and it
    could refer to a central area within a county or a specific community that isn''t
    well-defined as a city or town. This makes it difficult to determine the exact
    entities being compared. The lack of clarity regarding what exactly "County Center,
    VA" refers to introduces multiple interpretations. Therefore, the question could
    lead to different answers depending on how one defines these locations.'
  - The question asks whether Dorr, MI is more populous than County Center, VA. However,
    there is ambiguity because "County Center, VA" is not a well-defined location.
    It could refer to a central area within a specific county in Virginia, and without
    specifying which county, the question could refer to multiple places. This makes
    it difficult to determine the population comparison accurately.
  - The question asks whether Dorr, MI is more populous than County Center, VA. This
    question is AMBIGUOUS because "County Center, VA" is not a widely recognized or
    specific name for a place, and it could refer to multiple locations or administrative
    centers within Virginia counties. Without a clear reference to a specific city
    or census-designated place, the question lacks a single interpretation, leading
    to potential confusion and different answers based on assumptions about what "County
    Center" refers to.
  - The question asks for a comparison of the population sizes between Dorr, MI, and
    County Center, VA. The question seems straightforward in asking which of the two
    locations has a larger population. However, there is ambiguity in the question
    because "County Center, VA" is not a well-defined place name. It could refer to
    a central area within a specific county in Virginia, but without specifying which
    county, the question lacks clarity. Additionally, "Dorr, MI" is an unincorporated
    community, which might not have easily accessible population data, adding another
    layer of potential ambiguity regarding the data sources or definitions used. Therefore,
    the question admits more than one interpretation regarding the exact locations
    being compared, leading to different possible answers.
  - The question asks whether Dorr, MI is more populous than County Center, VA. This
    question is ambiguous because "County Center, VA" is not a well-defined or commonly
    recognized city or census-designated place. It could refer to a governmental or
    administrative region within a county, but without more specific information,
    it is unclear what population data should be compared. Additionally, if "County
    Center" were to refer to a central area within a specific county, the lack of
    a specific county name makes it impossible to determine the population size. Therefore,
    the question admits more than one interpretation and could lead to different answers
    depending on the interpretation of "County Center, VA."
  - The question asks about the population comparison between Dorr, MI, and County
    Center, VA. However, there is ambiguity in the phrasing. "County Center, VA" is
    not a well-defined place and could refer to different things, such as a central
    administrative area within a county or a specific location within Virginia that
    is not widely recognized as a city or town. Without a clear definition of what
    "County Center, VA" refers to, the question admits more than one interpretation
    regarding what location is being compared to Dorr, MI, leading to potentially
    different answers based on the interpretation of "County Center, VA."
  - The question asks whether Dorr, MI is more populous than County Center, VA. However,
    there is an ambiguity here because "County Center, VA" could refer to any central
    administrative area within a county in Virginia, and without specifying which
    county, it is unclear what location is being compared. Additionally, the population
    of these areas could be interpreted at different points in time, leading to potential
    discrepancies in answers. Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation.
  - The question asks whether Dorr, MI is more populous than County Center, VA. However,
    there are several ambiguities present. Firstly, "County Center, VA" is not a widely
    recognized name for a city or census-designated place, which introduces uncertainty
    about the location being referred to. It could potentially refer to a county administrative
    center, which is not a standardized location for population comparison. Additionally,
    without specific population data or a defined time frame, the question could be
    interpreted in various ways. Therefore, the question admits more than one interpretation.

  - The question asks whether Ridgebury, CT is more populous than Experiment, GA.
    However, Ridgebury is not a recognized city or town in Connecticut; it is actually
    a neighborhood in the town of Ridgefield. Similarly, Experiment is a census-designated
    place in Georgia, not an incorporated city. The ambiguity arises from the fact
    that the question references these locations as if they were cities, which could
    lead to confusion about what is being compared. Additionally, population data
    for neighborhoods and census-designated places might not be readily available
    or directly comparable to city population data, making the question open to interpretation
    regarding what data should be used to answer it.
  - 'The question asks for a comparison between the populations of two locations:
    Ridgebury, CT, and Experiment, GA. While the question is straightforward in structure,
    it is potentially ambiguous due to the nature of the locations mentioned. Ridgebury,

    not have distinct population data readily available. Similarly, Experiment, GA,
    is a census-designated place rather than an incorporated city. The ambiguity arises
    from the potential lack of direct population data for these specific areas, as
    well as the interpretation of what constitutes "more populous" when distinct data

    data should be used to answer it.'
  - 'The question is asking for a comparison of the population sizes of two specific
    locations: Ridgebury, CT, and Experiment, GA. However, the question is ambiguous
    for several reasons. First, Ridgebury is a locality in Connecticut, but it is

    is a large man-made lake in North Carolina, and Catawba is a county in North Carolina.
    Additionally, the question does not specify the criteria for comparison (e.g.,
    city limits, metropolitan area, etc.). Without a clear definition of what constitutes
    "Lake Norman of Catawba," the question can lead to different interpretations and
    answers.
  - The question is asking for a comparison of the populations of Lake Norman of Catawba,
    NC, and Cascades, VA. This question could be considered ambiguous for a couple
    of reasons. First, "Lake Norman of Catawba, NC" is not a city but a region around
    Lake Norman, which could include several towns or communities, making it unclear
    which specific population should be considered. Second, without specific definitions
    or boundaries of these areas, the question could be interpreted in various ways
    regarding what populations are being compared. Therefore, there is more than one
    way to interpret the entities involved, leading to potentially different answers.
  - 'The question asks for a comparison of population between two specific locations:
    Lake Norman of Catawba, NC, and Cascades, VA. However, the question is ambiguous
    because "Lake Norman of Catawba" refers to a region around Lake Norman that could

    is being referred to. Additionally, Cascades, VA, is a census-designated place,
    and its population might not be well-known without specific data. The ambiguity
    arises from unclear definitions of the geographic areas being compared, leading
    to potential multiple interpretations.
  - 'The question is comparing the population of two specific places: Lake Norman
    of Catawba, NC, and Cascades, VA. However, there is ambiguity in the naming and

  - 'The question asks for a comparison of population sizes between two locations:
    "University of California-Santa Barbara, CA" and "La Homa, TX." However, there
    is an inherent ambiguity in the question. "University of California-Santa Barbara"
    refers to a university and not a city, while "La Homa, TX" is a census-designated
    place. Comparing a university to a census-designated place is not straightforward,
    as they are fundamentally different entities. Furthermore, the population typically
    considered for cities refers to the number of residents, whereas a university
    population might refer to students, staff, or faculty. This difference in interpretation
    could lead to varying answers based on how one defines "population" in this context.'
  - The question is asking for a comparison of the population sizes between the University
    of California-Santa Barbara, CA, and La Homa, TX. The ambiguity arises because
    "University of California-Santa Barbara, CA" refers to a university, not a city,
    while La Homa, TX, is a census-designated place. Therefore, the question is comparing
    two entities that are not directly comparable as cities or population centers.

    comparison of the populations associated with the locations, but the entities
    themselves are not equivalent in terms of being cities.
  - 'The question is asking for a comparison of population sizes between two specific
    locations: University of California-Santa Barbara, CA, and La Homa, TX. However,

    the university itself, which would typically be much smaller than a city''s population.

    not a city and does not have a population in the same sense as a city. Alternatively,
    it might refer to the city of Santa Barbara, CA, but the phrasing does not make
    this clear. This ambiguity in what "University of California-Santa Barbara, CA"

    other surrounding area. Additionally, La Homa, TX is a census-designated place,
    not a city, which could lead to different interpretations of what specific area

  - 'The question is asking for a comparison of the populations of two places: University

    the city of Santa Barbara, CA, where the university is located, compared to La

  - The question asks about the population comparison between University of California-Santa
    Barbara, CA and La Homa, TX. The University of California-Santa Barbara is an
    institution and not a city, while La Homa, TX is a census-designated place. The

    interpretation. One could interpret the question as asking about the population
    of the university's campus area, or it could be misinterpreted as referring to
    the city of Santa Barbara, CA, where the university is located. Each interpretation
    could lead to different answers depending on whether one compares the student
    population, the city population, or another metric.
  - 'The question is asking for a comparison of population sizes between University
    of California-Santa Barbara, CA, and La Homa, TX. The ambiguity arises from the

    the population of the area surrounding the university (e.g., the city of Santa
    Barbara, CA) to that of La Homa, TX, this is not clear from the wording. Thus,
    the question can be interpreted in multiple ways: as a comparison between a university
    and a community, or between two communities, leading to different answers depending
    on the interpretation.'

  - 'The question compares the population sizes of two places: Yonah, GA and Danube,
    MN. The interpretation hinges on whether "Yonah, GA" and "Danube, MN" are recognized
    as specific cities or towns. However, "Yonah" is not a city or town in Georgia;
    it is a mountain, and there is no recognized city or town by that name. Similarly,
    "Danube" is a city in Minnesota, but without a comparable entity in Georgia, the
    question lacks a clear basis for comparison. Given this context, the question
    is ambiguous due to the potential misunderstanding of what "Yonah, GA" refers
    to, leading to different interpretations (e.g., whether considering a non-existent
    city or an unrelated geographical feature). Therefore, the question admits more
    than one interpretation regarding what is being compared.'
  - The question asks whether Yonah, GA is more populous than Danube, MN. However,
    there is ambiguity here because "Yonah" and "Danube" might not be widely recognized
    as cities or towns, and their status as such could be subject to different interpretations.
    Additionally, without specific and well-known demographic data readily available
    for these places, the question might be interpreted differently depending on sources
    or definitions of what constitutes a "city." This ambiguity in identifying these
    places and their population data leads to the potential for multiple interpretations
    and answers.
  - 'The question is asking for a comparison of population sizes between two locations:
    Yonah, GA and Danube, MN. However, the question is ambiguous because Yonah, GA
    is not a recognized city or town in the United States. Yonah typically refers
    to Mount Yonah in Georgia, which is a geographical feature rather than a populated
    area. This makes the question unclear as it could be interpreted in different
    ways, such as considering it a misspelling or referring to an unincorporated area.
    Without a clear definition of Yonah, GA as a populated place, the question does
    not have a straightforward interpretation or answer.'
  - The question asks if Yonah, GA is more populous than Danube, MN. To answer this,
    one would typically compare population statistics for the two locations. However,
    the question is ambiguous because Yonah, GA is not a recognized city or town;
    instead, Yonah is a mountain in Georgia, not a populated place. Additionally,
    Danube, MN is a city, but without clarity on what Yonah refers to, the comparison
    is not straightforward. Thus, the question admits more than one interpretation
    based on the understanding of what Yonah refers to, leading to different potential
    answers.
  - 'The question is asking for a comparison of population sizes between two places:
    Yonah, GA, and Danube, MN. However, there is an ambiguity in the question because
    "Yonah" is not clearly identified as a city or town, while "Danube" is a known
    city in Minnesota. Without a clear identification of what "Yonah" refers to, this
    question could lead to different interpretations regarding what specific locations
    are being compared. Additionally, the population data for these places might not
    be readily available or commonly known, adding to the potential ambiguity in answering
    the question accurately.'
  - The question asks about the relative population sizes of Yonah, GA, and Danube,
    MN. However, the phrasing "Yonah, GA" is ambiguous because there is no city or
    town officially named "Yonah" in Georgia. This could refer to a geographic feature
    like Yonah Mountain or a community that is not officially recognized as a city
    or town. Without a clear reference to a specific, recognized populated place,
    the question admits multiple interpretations based on what "Yonah, GA" could mean.
    Therefore, the question is ambiguous due to the unclear reference to a location
    that might not exist as an official entity.
  - The question is asking for a comparison of the population sizes between Yonah,
    GA and Danube, MN. It seems straightforward at first; however, the ambiguity arises
    from the fact that "Yonah" is not a well-known city or town in Georgia, and it
    could be a reference to a geographic feature or a smaller community that might
    not be officially recognized as a city. Without clear and widely recognized city
    status for Yonah, GA, the question becomes ambiguous, as it depends on what "Yonah,
    GA" is interpreted to mean. On the other hand, Danube, MN is a recognized city
    in Minnesota. This lack of clarity about Yonah's status as a city leads to multiple
    interpretations and potential answers based on different assumptions. Therefore,
    the question is ambiguous.
  - The question asks whether Yonah, GA is more populous than Danube, MN. It seems
    to be asking for a straightforward comparison of the populations of two specific
    places. However, there is a potential issue with the interpretation of the locations
    mentioned. Yonah, GA is not a recognized city; it refers to Mount Yonah in Georgia,
    which is a geographic feature rather than a populated area. Danube, MN is a small
    city in Minnesota. The ambiguity arises from the reference to Yonah, GA as a city,
    which it is not, thus creating confusion about what exactly is being compared.
    This could lead to different answers based on the interpretation of what Yonah,
    GA refers to. Therefore, the question is ambiguous due to the unclear reference
    to Yonah, GA as a city.
  - The question asks whether Yonah, GA is more populous than Danube, MN. However,
    there is an ambiguity regarding the places mentioned. "Yonah" typically refers
    to a mountain or natural feature in Georgia, rather than a city or town. Similarly,
    "Danube" is a river in Europe and not a recognized city or town in Minnesota.
    Without clear reference to specific cities or towns, the question is ambiguous
    as it could be interpreted in multiple ways, such as referring to unincorporated
    communities or other geographic features that might not have population data available.
  - 'The question asks for a comparison of population sizes between two specific places:
    Yonah, GA, and Danube, MN. The question seems straightforward as it asks for a

    ambiguous because "Yonah, GA" could refer to different geographical entities or
    regions (e.g., a community, a mountain area, or another place with similar names)
    within Georgia, and it''s unclear without additional context which specific "Yonah"
    is being referred to. This ambiguity could lead to different interpretations and
    answers depending on the specific location being compared. Thus, the question
    does not meet the criteria for having only one interpretation and one correct
    answer.'

  - This question is asking for a comparison of population sizes between Bangor Base,
    WA, and Willis, TX. The question is straightforward in its request for a comparison
    of population sizes, which is a quantifiable measure. However, there is a potential
    issue with interpretation. "Bangor Base, WA" may refer to Naval Base Kitsap-Bangor,
    a military installation, which might not have a standard population count like
    a city. If the question is interpreted to mean the broader area around Bangor
    Base, the answer could differ. The ambiguity arises from the interpretation of
    what constitutes "Bangor Base, WA" as a population entity. Additionally, if Bangor
    Base is considered as part of a larger city or area, the answer may vary based

  - The question asks for a population comparison between Bangor Base, WA, and Willis,
    TX. This appears straightforward, but it contains ambiguity. "Bangor Base, WA"
    likely refers to Naval Base Kitsap - Bangor, which is not a city but a naval base,
    while Willis, TX, is a city. The question's interpretation depends on whether
    the comparison involves the populations of the base and the city or the surrounding
    areas. The ambiguity arises from not specifying what is meant by "populous" in
    the context of a naval base versus a city.
  - The question asks about the population comparison between "Bangor Base, WA" and
    "Willis, TX." There is potential ambiguity here because "Bangor Base, WA" may
    refer to a specific military base, Naval Base Kitsap - Bangor, rather than a city
    or town, which typically have population statistics readily available. Additionally,
    "Willis, TX" is a small city in Texas. The question could be interpreted as asking
    for a comparison between a military base population and a city population, which
    is not a standard comparison and may require clarification. Furthermore, the term
    "Bangor Base" could also be misinterpreted if not widely recognized. Due to these
    factors, the question can be seen as having more than one interpretation, leading

  - The question is asking for a comparison of the population size between Mount Ephraim,
    NJ, and Sawgrass, FL. However, it is ambiguous because the name "Sawgrass" can
    refer to different locations, such as a community in Florida or a part of a larger
    area like Sawgrass Mills, a large shopping center in Sunrise, FL. Without specifying
    which "Sawgrass" is being referred to, the question can lead to different interpretations
    and answers.
  - The question asks for a comparison of the population sizes between Mount Ephraim,
    NJ, and Sawgrass, FL. To determine whether this question is clear or ambiguous,
    we need to consider the specificity of the locations mentioned. Mount Ephraim,
    NJ, is a specific borough in Camden County, New Jersey, so it is clear what location
    is being referred to. However, "Sawgrass, FL" is ambiguous because it could refer
    to a few different places in Florida, including areas within the city of Sunrise
    in Broward County, or it could be a non-incorporated area or development. Due
    to the lack of specificity and the potential for multiple locations being referred
    to by "Sawgrass, FL," the question admits more than one interpretation regarding
    the exact location being compared to Mount Ephraim, NJ.

    it might be referring to a region or development known by that name. Without a
    clear definition or official recognition of Sawgrass, FL as a city or census-designated
    place, the question admits more than one interpretation regarding what specific
    population data should be considered. This makes the question ambiguous because
    it is unclear what exactly is meant by "Sawgrass, FL." Additionally, the populations
    of small communities or regions might not be readily available or comparable,
    adding to the ambiguity.'
  - 'The question is asking for a comparison of population between two specific locations:

    is a straightforward comparison of the populations of two specific cities. The
    question provides clear criteria for comparison (population) and specifies the
    entities involved (Lone Grove, OK and Baxley, GA). There is only one interpretation
    of this question, and it can be answered definitively by examining population
    data for both cities.
  - 'The question is asking for a comparison of the population sizes between two specific
    locations: Lone Grove, OK, and Baxley, GA. The question is straightforward and
    seeks a factual answer based on population data. It does not present any ambiguity
    in terms of what is being asked or how it could be interpreted differently. Therefore,
    it admits one interpretation and one correct answer based on the latest available
    population statistics.'

  - 'The question is asking for a comparison of the populations of two specific locations:
    Lone Grove, Oklahoma, and Baxley, Georgia. The question is clear in its request
    for a population comparison between these two cities. The interpretation is straightforward,
    as it seeks factual data regarding the population sizes of the named cities. There

  - 'The question is asking for a comparison of the population sizes between Oakton,
    VA, and Elmont, NY. The question is specific and only admits one interpretation:
    it seeks to know which of the two places has a greater population. This can be
    answered definitively with demographic data, making the question clear.'
  - The question asks whether Oakton, VA is more populous than Elmont, NY. This question
    could be considered CLEAR if population data is readily available and unchanging
    for both locations. However, population figures can vary depending on the source,
    the year of the data, and the definition of the area being measured (e.g., city
    proper, metropolitan area). Without specific context or a specified time frame,
    the question could lead to different answers based on different data sources or
    interpretations of the area boundaries.
  - The question asks whether Oakton, VA is more populous than Elmont, NY. This question
    appears to be straightforward as it is asking for a comparison of population sizes
    between two specific locations. However, the ambiguity arises from the potential
    for changes in population data over time and differences in data sources. Without
    specifying the time frame or the source of population data, the question could
    lead to different answers based on when or how the population is measured. Thus,
    the question is ambiguous because it lacks specificity regarding the data reference
    point.
  - The question asks if Oakton, VA is more populous than Elmont, NY. This question
    is straightforward in that it seeks a comparison between the populations of two
    specific locations. However, the ambiguity arises from the lack of a specified
    time frame or data source, which could lead to different answers if population
    data from different years or sources is considered. Therefore, the question can
    be interpreted in multiple ways depending on these factors.
  - 'The question is asking for a comparison of population sizes between two specific
    locations: Oakton, VA and Elmont, NY. The question is straightforward and does
    not admit multiple interpretations. It seeks a factual answer based on demographic
    data. There is only one correct answer depending on the current population statistics
    of the two places.'
  - "The question asks whether Oakton, VA is more populous than Elmont, NY. This seems\
    \ to be a straightforward comparison of population sizes between two specific\
    \ locations. However, the question can be considered ambiguous for a couple of\
    \ reasons: \n1. It does not specify the time frame for the population data, which\
    \ could affect the answer if population sizes have changed over time.\n2. Population\
    \ can be measured in different ways, such as total population or population density,\
    \ and the question does not specify which measure to use.\n\nBecause of these\
    \ possible interpretations, the question could lead to different answers depending\
    \ on the assumptions made about the time frame and the measure of population."
  - The question asks whether Oakton, VA is more populous than Elmont, NY. While the
    question seems straightforward, it could be considered ambiguous due to several
    factors. Firstly, the population of cities can change over time, so the question
    might depend on which year's data is being considered. Secondly, the definitions
    of "Oakton, VA" and "Elmont, NY" might vary based on whether one is considering
    just the town proper or the greater metropolitan area. Without specifying these
    details, the question may lead to different interpretations and answers.
  - 'The question asks for a comparison of the population sizes of two specific locations:
    Oakton, VA, and Elmont, NY. While the question is straightforward in asking which
    location has a larger population, it is ambiguous because the term "more populous"
    could be interpreted in terms of different data points, such as different years
    or estimates. Moreover, the populations of such small areas might not be widely
    known or readily available, potentially leading to different answers depending
    on the source of the population data.'
  - The question asks for a comparison of population sizes between Oakton, VA, and
    Elmont, NY. This seems straightforward at first, but it is ambiguous because it
    does not specify the time frame for the population data. Population sizes can
    change over time due to various factors, and without a specified date or data
    source, the question admits multiple interpretations (e.g., 2020 census data,
    current estimates, etc.), each potentially leading to different answers.
  - The question asks whether Oakton, VA is more populous than Elmont, NY. This question
    is clear in its intent as it seeks a direct comparison between the populations
    of two specific locations. The population of a place is a quantifiable and objective
    measure, and thus, there is only one correct answer based on current population
    data. Therefore, the question does not admit multiple interpretations.
