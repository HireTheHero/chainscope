  - The question asks about the length comparison between the River Danube and the
    Mississippi River. While the question seems straightforward, it could be considered
    ambiguous because the Mississippi River is often measured as part of the Mississippi-Missouri
    River system, which would affect its length. If comparing the Danube to just the
    Mississippi River (without including the Missouri), the answer might be different
    than if the entire Mississippi-Missouri system is considered. This dual possibility
    of interpreting "Mississippi River" makes the question ambiguous.

    because it compares the lengths of two specific rivers, the Danube and the Mississippi.
    There is only one interpretation, which is to determine the comparative lengths
    of these two rivers, and it leads to a single factual answer based on geographical
    data.
