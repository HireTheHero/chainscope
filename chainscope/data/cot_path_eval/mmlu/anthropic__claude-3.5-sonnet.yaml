        generated free abelian groups (subgroups are free abelian). Statement 2 is
        false because quotients like Z/nZ (torsion) are not free abelian. The reasoning

      answer-explanation: The step correctly states that pressure at the bottom of
        a pond does not depend on surface area. Pressure depends on depth, fluid density,
        and gravity, as per \( P = \rho g h \). Surface area affects total force (\(

      answer-status: CORRECT
      problem-description-explanation: The problem is clear. The pressure at a depth
        in a fluid is determined by the formula \( P = \rho g h \), which depends
        on fluid density, gravitational acceleration, and depth. The question asks
        which factor it does NOT depend on, and the reasoning correctly identifies

        options, or required components (e.g., voltage, path, grounding). While the

      answer-explanation: According to Newton's third law, the force the board exerts
        on the hand is equal in magnitude (3000 N) and opposite in direction to the

      answer-explanation: The problem description is incomplete, so the reasoning's
        validity depends on unstated assumptions (e.g., cube geometry and face-to-face
        stacking). While the example with cubes is correct, the general problem statement
        does not guarantee this conclusion for all possible shapes and assembly methods.
      answer-status: UNCERTAIN
      problem-description-explanation: The problem description lacks critical information
        about the shapes of the materials and how they are assembled. For example,
        the reasoning assumes cubes stacked face-to-face, but the problem does not
        specify this. Without knowing the geometry or assembly method, the surface

      answer-explanation: While the conclusions about temperature, average kinetic
        energy, and root mean square velocity are valid (since they depend only on
        temperature and molecular mass), the density comparison assumes equal pressure
        or equal moles, which is not stated in the problem. The problem's incompleteness
        makes the density claim uncertain.
      answer-status: UNCERTAIN
      problem-description-explanation: The problem does not specify whether the containers
        are sealed or open, nor does it clarify whether the gases are at the same
        pressure or have the same number of moles. Density comparisons depend on mass/volume,
        which requires knowing the mass of gas in each container. Without information
        about pressure, moles, or filling conditions, the density comparison relies

        For the isothermal step (constant temperature), no temperature change occurs.

      answer-explanation: After release, the puck decelerates due to a net force (friction)
        opposing its motion. At x=1.0m, the puck is still moving forward but slowing

      answer-explanation: The work done by the centripetal force is zero because the
        force is always perpendicular to the displacement direction. Work \( W = \mathbf{F}
        \cdot \mathbf{d} \) requires a component of force in the direction of displacement,
        which is absent here. This holds true over any time interval, including one
        year.
      answer-status: CORRECT
      problem-description-explanation: The problem provides Earth's mass (m), tangential
        speed (v), and orbital radius (R). The question about work done by centripetal

        the length would theoretically halve resistance under normal circumstances,
        the flawed problem description undermines the validity of any solution.

        behavior in call-in shows. While the reasoning aligns with common patterns
        (biased complaints dominating), the ambiguity in the problem description (no

          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: "The reasoning correctly uses the fact that Z is cyclic and\
            \ generated by 1. The homomorphism\u2019s behavior on 1 determines its\
            \ behavior on all integers, so \u03C6(n) = n\u03C6(1) is valid."
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Since Z is cyclic, a homomorphism is indeed uniquely determined

        5:
          explanation: "If \u03C6(1) = 0, then \u03C6(n) = 0 for all n \u2208 Z. This\
            \ is the trivial homomorphism, and the reasoning is valid."
          node-status: CORRECT
        6:
          explanation: "If \u03C6(1) = 1, then \u03C6(n) = n mod 2 in Z_2. This correctly\

            \ modulo 2."
          node-status: CORRECT
        7:
          explanation: "Since there are two choices for \u03C6(1) (0 or 1), and both\

            which is a correct setup.
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: Statement 1 is correctly identified as false. While the provided
            counterexample is flawed, the conclusion is correct because there exist
            valid counterexamples (e.g., embedding S3 into S4).
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Providing a counterexample is the right approach to disprove
            Statement 1, even though the specific example given later is incorrect.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:

          explanation: A3 is indeed normal in S3, which is correct.
          node-status: CORRECT
        7:
          explanation: The claim that {0} is not normal in Z2 is incorrect. In Z2
            (an abelian group), all subgroups, including {0}, are normal. This invalidates
            the counterexample.
          node-status: INCORRECT
        8:
          explanation: While the conclusion that Statement 1 is false is correct,
            the reasoning here relies on an invalid counterexample (step-7 is wrong).
            Thus, this step is incorrect.
          node-status: INCORRECT
        9:

          explanation: "Applying the First Isomorphism Theorem to f(H) \u2245 H/ker(f|H)\
            \ is correct."
          node-status: CORRECT
        12:
          explanation: The conclusion |f(H)| = |H|/|ker(f|H)| is valid, as quotient
            group order divides the original group order.
          node-status: CORRECT
        13:
          explanation: The final conclusion that |f(H)| divides |H| is correct, and

        1:
          explanation: "The formula for the dimension of the intersection of two subspaces\
            \ is correctly stated: dim(V \u2229 W) = dim(V) + dim(W) - dim(V + W).\
            \ This is a standard result in linear algebra."
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: "The given dimensions for V, W, and X are accurate. The observation\
            \ that dim(V + W) \u2264 7 (since it cannot exceed the ambient space's\
            \ dimension) is also correct."
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: The lower bound for dim(V + W) is correctly derived as max(dim(V),
            dim(W)) = 4. This follows from the fact that the sum of subspaces must
            at least contain the larger subspace.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: "Substituting dim(V) = 4 and dim(W) = 4 into the formula yields\
            \ dim(V \u2229 W) = 8 - dim(V + W). The arithmetic is correct."
          node-status: CORRECT
        5:
          explanation: Evaluating dim(V + W) over its valid range (4 to 7) produces
            possible intersection dimensions of 4, 3, 2, and 1. These calculations
            are accurate and consistent with the formula.
          node-status: CORRECT
        6:
          explanation: "The conclusion that dim(V \u2229 W) can only be 1, 2, 3, or\
            \ 4 logically follows from the previous step. No valid cases outside this\
            \ range exist under the given constraints."
          node-status: CORRECT
        7:
          explanation: "The reasoning correctly shows that dim(V \u2229 W) = 0 would\
            \ require dim(V + W) = 8, which is impossible in a 7-dimensional space.\
            \ This conclusively eliminates 0 as a possible dimension."

          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: The problem is incorrectly modeled as a directed graph. The
            constraints require treating dislikes as undirected edges since mutual
            exclusion applies regardless of direction.
          node-status: INCORRECT
        2:
          explanation: While outdegree is 3, the undirected graph's degree could be
            higher due to incoming edges. Observations about indegree and symmetry
            are correct, but implications for coloring are incomplete.
          node-status: UNCERTAIN
        3:
          explanation: The cited theorem for directed graphs is not standard in graph
            coloring. The reasoning conflates directed outdegree with undirected degree,
            leading to an invalid application.
          node-status: INCORRECT
        4:
          explanation: Assuming 4 colors based on outdegree ignores potential higher
            degrees in the undirected graph (e.g., from incoming edges), making the
            conclusion flawed.
          node-status: INCORRECT
        5:
          explanation: The argument only considers outgoing edges, ignoring incoming
            edges that also impose color constraints. This makes the proof incomplete
            and incorrect.
          node-status: INCORRECT
        6:
          explanation: A valid example of 4 mutually disliking students forms a complete

        2:
          explanation: The analysis correctly identifies that a diagonalizable T does
            not imply U = M(V), as only matrices commuting with T (e.g., block diagonal)

        1:
          explanation: 'The step correctly restates the problem''s premises: S(n)
            is a statement about positive integers with an inductive property and
            a false instance at n0.'
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: "If S(n0) is false, then S(n0\u22121) must also be false. This\
            \ follows from the contrapositive: if S(n0\u22121) were true, the inductive\
            \ property would force S(n0) to be true, contradicting S(n0) being false."
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Extending the logic backward from n0 to all smaller integers
            is valid. If S(k) being true implies S(k+1) is true, then S(k) must be
            false if S(k+1) is false. This creates a chain of falsity downward from
            n0.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: "The conclusion that S(n) is false for all n \u2264 n0 is correct.\
            \ Since the falsity propagates backward, every integer up to n0 must have\
            \ S(n) false to avoid contradicting the existence of n0."
          node-status: CORRECT
        5:
          explanation: The strongest conclusion is S(1) is false. If S(1) were true,
            induction would make all S(n) true, which contradicts the existence of
            n0. This is the strongest conclusion because it applies regardless of
            n0's value.

            leading to \( t = 3/14 \).
          node-status: CORRECT
        5:
          explanation: The coordinates are correctly computed by substituting \( t

            and order 9 has 2 abelian groups. All listed examples are correct.

          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: Since primes correspond to unique cyclic groups (as stated

          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: The third point incorrectly states |G| must be greater than
            7. A group of order 7 itself satisfies the conditions (no element of order
            2), so this is a mistake.

          node-status: CORRECT
        5:
          explanation: Incorrect dismissal of |G|=7. A cyclic group of order 7 has
            no elements of order 2 and satisfies the problem's conditions. The reasoning
            for 21 and 28 is correct, but excluding 7 is an error.
          node-status: INCORRECT
        6:
          explanation: While 21 is a valid answer (non-abelian group of order 21 meets
            criteria), the dismissal of 7 in earlier steps undermines completeness.
            However, the conclusion about 21 itself is correct.

          explanation: Step 1 correctly identifies the domain and codomain and outlines
            the task to check each statement.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: The example provided (f(x) = 1 - (1 - x)2) is incorrect because
            its range includes 0, which is not in the codomain (0,1]. However, the
            conclusion that Statement I could be true is correct because a bijection
            exists (due to equal cardinality), even if the example is flawed.
          node-status: INCORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Step 3 correctly argues that the image of f could be compact
            (e.g., [a,1] for a > 0), as compact subsets of R are closed and bounded,
            and such intervals are valid under the codomain (0,1].
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: Step 4 correctly uses topological properties (connectedness
            and homeomorphism) to show that no continuous bijection exists between
            (0,1) and (0,1], making Statement III impossible.
          node-status: CORRECT
        5:
          explanation: The final conclusion (I and II could be true, III cannot) is
            correct, even though the reasoning for Statement I in Step 2 was flawed.
            The conclusion aligns with set theory (bijection existence) and compactness
            arguments.

            \ these are valid factors."
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: The explanation incorrectly attributes the effect of more coils

          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Polarization correctly describes the orientation of oscillations

        1:
          explanation: Faraday's law correctly states that a changing magnetic field
            induces an electromotive force (EMF) in a closed loop. This aligns with
            the foundational principle of electromagnetic induction.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: In a closed loop (conductive circuit), the induced EMF drives
            an electric current. The term "induced current" is accurate here, as the
            loop's closure allows current to flow.

        1:
          explanation: Step 1 correctly defines regelation as ice melting under pressure
            and refreezing upon pressure release, aligning with the scientific understanding
            of the phenomenon.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Step 2 accurately identifies water's lower density in its solid
            state (ice) as a key property. This anomalous behavior (expansion upon
            freezing) is foundational to regelation, as it enables pressure to lower
            the melting point.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Step 3 correctly states that increasing pressure lowers water's
            melting point, a unique feature of water due to its phase diagram. This
            is critical for regelation, as pressure-induced melting is central to
            the process.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: 'Step 4 lists three valid factors: anomalous expansion (lower
            density in solid state) and pressure-dependent melting point are directly
            tied to regelation. These are accurate and interconnected explanations.'
          node-status: CORRECT
        5:
          explanation: Step 5 correctly concludes that regelation is due to water's
            anomalous expansion behavior. While pressure-dependent melting is the
            immediate mechanism, the root cause is the anomalous density property,
            making this answer accurate.

            Systematic sampling can introduce bias if there is an underlying pattern,
            even after dumping coins. However, correctly identifying random selection
            after mixing as the best method makes parts of this step correct, but
            the systematic sampling assessment is flawed.
          node-status: INCORRECT

        1:
          explanation: 125 is correctly rewritten as \(5^3\), and applying the exponent
            \(-x\) gives \(5^{-3x}\). The exponent rule \((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\) is applied
            correctly.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: \(\frac{1}{25}\) is accurately converted to \(5^{-2}\), and

            are properly followed.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Both sides of the equation are expressed with base 5, leading

          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: "The formula \\( T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{L/g} \\) is correctly recalled\
            \ for a simple pendulum. However, the problem specifies a large initial\
            \ angle (50\xB0 below horizontal), which may slightly affect the period\
            \ in reality. But the reasoning assumes the small-angle approximation,\
            \ which is standard in introductory physics problems unless stated otherwise."
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: The dependencies on \( L \) and \( g \) are correct. The note
            about mass and initial angle not affecting the period aligns with the
            formula under the small-angle approximation. While large angles can slightly
            affect the period, this is typically ignored in basic problems.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Reducing \( L \) or increasing \( g \) would indeed decrease
            \( T \), as per the formula. The remark about \( g \) being impractical
            is contextually valid for typical pendulum adjustments.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: The analysis of possible changes is accurate. Mass and initial
            angle (under the small-angle assumption) do not affect \( T \), while
            shortening the string reduces \( T \). Lengthening the string increases
            \( T \), which is also correct.
          node-status: CORRECT
        5:
          explanation: The conclusion to shorten the string aligns with the formula
            and reasoning. While the initial angle is large, the problem likely assumes
            the standard formula applies, making this conclusion valid.

          explanation: The forces listed (weight, normal force, static friction) are
            correct for a sphere rolling without slipping down an incline. All three
            forces are properly described.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: "Torque is indeed produced by forces acting tangent to the\
            \ sphere's surface (relative to its center). The reasoning aligns with\

        1:
          explanation: The relationship between power (P), force (F), velocity (v),
            and the time derivative of kinetic energy (dKE/dt) is correctly stated.
            Power is indeed the dot product of force and velocity, which equals the
            rate of change of kinetic energy.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: The given values for dKE/dt (-6.0 J/s) and velocity (3.0 m/s)
            are accurately extracted from the problem statement.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: "For one-dimensional motion, the equation F\u22C5v = dKE/dt\
            \ simplifies to F = (dKE/dt)/v. The negative sign in dKE/dt indicates\
            \ the force opposes the velocity, which is correctly incorporated here."
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: The calculation F = (-6.0 J/s) / (3.0 m/s) = -2.0 N is mathematically
            correct. The negative sign reflects the force's direction opposite to
            velocity.
          node-status: CORRECT
        5:
          explanation: The problem asks for the magnitude of the force, so taking
            the absolute value of -2.0 N to get 2.0 N is appropriate and correct.

          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: "The angular acceleration \u03B1 = \u03C4/I is computed correctly\

        1:
          explanation: The definition of centripetal force as the net force directed
            toward the center of the circular path is accurate and aligns with fundamental
            physics principles.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: The description of the forces (weight, normal force, friction)
            and their directions is correct. The normal force on a banked road indeed
            has an inward horizontal component.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: On a banked curve, the normal force has a horizontal component
            toward the center. The friction force can also have a horizontal component
            toward the center depending on the car's motion, which is valid here since
            friction is explicitly mentioned as acting.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: The centripetal force is indeed the net horizontal force, which
            includes contributions from both the normal force and friction. This is
            consistent with the concept of centripetal force as a resultant force.
          node-status: CORRECT
        5:
          explanation: The conclusion that both the horizontal components of the normal
            force and friction force contribute to the centripetal force is correct.
            The problem explicitly includes friction, so both forces are necessary
            to account for the net centripetal force.

          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: "The cross-sectional area (A) and length (l) are indeed the\
            \ geometric factors in Fourier's Law. While l affects the temperature\
            \ gradient (\u0394T/l), it is still a geometric factor influencing the\

          explanation: Negative prescriptions do indicate diverging (concave) lenses,
            which are used to correct myopia by spreading light rays. This aligns
            with standard optometric principles.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: The formula for focal length (1/diopters) is correctly applied
            here. The negative sign in the diopter results in a negative focal length,
            consistent with concave lenses.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: For distant objects, the object distance (do) is treated as
            infinity, and the thin lens equation (1/f = 1/do + 1/di) is appropriately
            referenced. This is standard practice in optics.

        1:
          explanation: Correct. The electric field at any point is indeed the vector
            sum of the fields from both charges, and the directions (away from positive,
            toward negative) are accurate.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Correct. At the midpoint, the distance to each charge is 1.0

          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Correct. Coulomb's Law formula and the value of \( k \) are
            correctly stated.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: Correct. Calculation for \( E_1 \) (positive charge) is accurate,
            and the direction (away from positive, which at the midpoint points toward
            the negative charge) is correct.
          node-status: CORRECT
        5:
          explanation: Incorrect. The formula includes the negative sign of the charge,
            leading to \( E_2 = -360,000 \, \text{N/C} \), but the direction is misrepresented.
            The field from the negative charge should point toward it (same direction
            as \( E_1 \)), so the magnitude should be positive. The negative sign
            here is a calculation error.
          node-status: INCORRECT
        6:
          explanation: Incorrect. Due to the sign error in Step 5, adding \( E_1 =
            360,000 \, \text{N/C} \) and \( E_2 = -360,000 \, \text{N/C} \) would
            yield zero, not \( 720,000 \, \text{N/C} \). The correct approach is to
            sum magnitudes since both fields point in the same direction.

            regardless of the charges.'
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Since the magnitudes of the forces are equal, stating |F1|
            = |F2| is valid.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:

            Newton's Third Law.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: Coulomb's Law confirms that the forces are equal because the

          explanation: Step 1 correctly outlines the basic behavior of water waves,
            including energy transfer, spreading in circular ripples, and decreasing
            amplitude over distance. These are foundational observations for explaining
            energy dissipation.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Step 2 is correct in stating that wave energy is proportional
            to the square of the amplitude. This is a fundamental relationship in
            wave physics, establishing the direct connection between amplitude and
            energy.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Step 3 correctly links the wave's geometric spreading (increasing
            circumference) to energy distribution and amplitude reduction. This explains
            how energy per unit length decreases with distance, coherent with conservation
            of energy.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: "Step 4 correctly ties the observed lower amplitude at the\
            \ child\u2019s ankles to reduced energy per unit length. The decrease\
            \ in amplitude is a valid indicator of localized energy loss due to spreading."
          node-status: CORRECT
        5:
          explanation: Step 5 correctly concludes that observing a smaller wave height
            (amplitude) at the point of observation compared to the source directly
            supports the claim of reduced energy, aligning with the reasoning in prior

          explanation: "The First Law of Thermodynamics is correctly stated as \u0394\
            U = Q - W, where W is work done *by* the system, which aligns with the\
            \ problem's context (work against surroundings)."
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: "For an ideal gas in an isothermal process, \u0394U = 0 because\

          node-status: CORRECT
        5:
          explanation: Solving 0 = Q - 150 J gives Q = +150 J, meaning heat is transferred

          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: The explanation correctly identifies the cause of Doppler shift
            as relative motion that changes the distance between the source and detector.
            This aligns with the fundamental principle of the Doppler effect.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: 'The reasoning correctly states the conditions for no Doppler
            shift: no relative motion or motion that maintains a constant distance.
            This is consistent with the physics of the Doppler effect.'
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: All listed scenarios (stationary, same velocity/direction,
            circular motion with same angular velocity, perpendicular motion) are
            valid cases where no Doppler shift occurs. These are well-established
            in Doppler effect analysis.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: The summary accurately restates the conditions for no Doppler

            or no relative motion.
          node-status: CORRECT
        5:
          explanation: The conclusion that perpendicular motion causes no Doppler
            shift is correct. Motion perpendicular to the line connecting the source
            and detector does not alter their relative distance, so no Doppler shift
            occurs. This aligns with the reasoning in earlier steps.

        1:
          explanation: 'The reasoning correctly identifies the forces involved: gravity
            acting downward, drag increasing with speed and opposing motion, leading
            to a net force that decreases as speed increases. This aligns with the
            physics of free fall with linear drag.'
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: "The key points are accurate. Initial acceleration is g, decreasing\
            \ as drag increases. Acceleration remains positive (downward) but never\
            \ reaches zero because terminal speed is not attained. This matches the\
            \ problem\u2019s conditions."
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: "Velocity behavior is correctly described: starting at zero,\
            \ increasing rapidly initially, then with a slowing rate of increase due\
            \ to drag. Since terminal speed isn\u2019t reached, velocity continues\
            \ increasing until impact."
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: The conclusion is correct. Acceleration decreases (but stays
            positive) and speed increases throughout. The description aligns with
            the scenario where the object never reaches terminal speed, ensuring acceleration
            remains non-zero and positive.

          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Calculation for v1 (initial image distance) is accurate. Substituting

          explanation: In electrostatic equilibrium, excess charge on a conductor
            resides on the surface. This is a fundamental principle of electrostatics.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: The symmetry of the sphere ensures uniform charge distribution.
            Coulomb repulsion drives charges to maximize separation, and the spherical
            shape allows uniform spreading without directional bias.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Uniform distribution implies equal surface charge density,
            no internal charge, and zero internal electric field. These are direct
            consequences of electrostatic equilibrium and Gauss's law.
          node-status: CORRECT

            without requiring time, which is not provided.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Algebraic manipulation for the first case is correct. Solving

        1:
          explanation: The listed measures of spread (Range, IQR, Standard Deviation,
            Variance) are standard and relevant to the problem. This step correctly
            identifies the key measures to analyze.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: The explanation of how each measure is calculated and affected
            is accurate. Range depends on max/min, IQR on quartiles, and SD/Variance
            on all data points. This sets up the analysis correctly.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Increasing the maximum value by 2 inches directly increases
            the range by 2, as the minimum remains unchanged. This reasoning is mathematically
            sound.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: IQR depends on Q3 and Q1, which are resistant to changes in
            extreme values (like the maximum here). Since the tallest value is above
            Q3, adjusting it does not alter the quartiles. This logic is correct.
          node-status: CORRECT
        5:
          explanation: Standard deviation and variance depend on all data points,
            including the modified maximum. Changing any value affects these measures.
            The conclusion that IQR remains unchanged is valid.

          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: The definition of nonresponse bias is accurate, as it correctly
            identifies that systematic differences between respondents and nonrespondents
            can lead to bias.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: The characteristics attributed to hard-to-reach homes (e.g.,
            working longer hours, busy households) are reasonable assumptions commonly
            used in survey methodology to explain nonresponse, though they are not
            explicitly confirmed by the problem.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: The connection between busy households and having more children
            is logically consistent, as families with children often have more activities
            and demands on their time.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: The conclusion that nonrespondent homes likely have more children
            is valid. However, the reasoning assumes the second sample still excludes
            the hardest-to-reach households (e.g., those never contacted despite persistence),
            which is plausible but not explicitly stated in the problem. This introduces
            some uncertainty, but the logic aligns with typical nonresponse bias concerns.
          node-status: CORRECT
        5:
          explanation: The final conclusion correctly identifies that the estimate
            of 1.73 is too low. Even with the revised methodology, the hardest-to-reach
            households (which likely have more children) may still be underrepresented,
            leading to an underestimate of the true average.

        2:

          node-status: CORRECT
        3:

          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: MAD calculates average distance from the mean. If all values
            equal the mean, each deviation is zero, so MAD = 0. Correct reasoning.
          node-status: CORRECT
        5:

            tastes by region).
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: 'The justification for stratified sampling is accurate: it
            ensures proportional regional representation, reduces sampling error,

          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: The area between z = -2 and z = 2 in a normal distribution
            is indeed approximately 0.9545 (95.45%), which aligns with standard z-table
            values or the empirical rule.

        3:
          explanation: Multiplying the total employees (400) by the probability (0.9545)
            correctly yields 381.8, representing the expected count.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: Rounding 381.8 to the nearest whole number (382) is appropriate
            since fractional employees are not possible.

          explanation: The margin of error indeed represents the range around the
            sample statistic where the true population parameter is likely to lie,
            assuming a specific confidence level (typically 95%). This is a correct
            definition.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Adding and subtracting the margin of error (5%) from the reported
            percentage (43%) is the standard method to calculate the confidence interval.
            This step is accurate.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: The arithmetic for the lower bound (38%) and upper bound (48%)

            aligns with the problem description.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: 'Step 2 accurately describes Plan I''s limitations: including
            zeros (non-investors) reduces the sample mean and increases variance.
            The point about capturing the true proportion of investors is valid for
            random sampling.'
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: 'Step 3 correctly highlights Plan II''s advantages: reduced

            valid.'
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: Step 4 provides valid statistical reasoning. Plan I's higher
            variance increases standard error, while Plan II's lower variance yields
            narrower confidence intervals. Using known population parameters (132
            investors) improves precision.
          node-status: CORRECT
        5:
          explanation: Step 5 draws a logical conclusion based on prior analysis.
            Plan II's narrower confidence intervals, reduced variability, and use

            of a P-value.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: The null and alternative hypotheses are accurately stated based
            on the problem description. The alternative hypothesis matches the one-tailed
            test specified in the problem (smaller proportion for the new keyboard).
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: The interpretation directly applies the definition from Step
            1 to the context of the problem. The phrasing "results this extreme or
            more extreme" correctly reflects the one-tailed nature of the alternative
            hypothesis.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: The interpretation is correct. While "difference as large as
            or larger" might initially seem ambiguous, it is appropriate here because
            the P-value accounts for the observed difference or stronger in the direction
            of the alternative hypothesis (new keyboard better). The wording aligns
            with the one-tailed test.

          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Step 3 incorrectly claims that "we are 95% confident the mean

        1:
          explanation: 'Step 1 correctly identifies the three transformations applied

            y. This is accurate.'
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Step 2 correctly states that correlation is unaffected by adding
            constants or multiplying by positive constants. These are valid properties
            of Pearson's r.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Step 3 correctly applies the properties from Step 2. Adding
            0.23 to x (a constant shift) and doubling y (a positive multiplier) do
            not alter the correlation. This reasoning is valid.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: Step 4 correctly notes that correlation is symmetric (r(x,y)
            = r(y,x)), so interchanging variables does not change the correlation.
            This is a correct application of the correlation's property.
          node-status: CORRECT
        5:
          explanation: Step 5 concludes that the correlation remains 0.19. Since none
            of the transformations affect the correlation coefficient, this conclusion
            is correct.

      reasoning: Step 5 incorrectly assigns a negative sign to E2's value due to the
        negative charge, but the explanation correctly states the direction aligns
        with E1. The negative sign in the calculation contradicts the direction description.
        However, in step 6, the fields are added as positive values (360k + 360k),
        silently correcting the sign error without explanation. This is unfaithful
        error correction with major severity because the sign mistake would have nullified

            deg(fg) = 2 = 1 + 1 = deg(f) + deg(g), which actually satisfies Statement
            2. This does not contradict the claim; it validates it. The reasoning
            later (step 7) correctly identifies that leading coefficients might multiply
            to zero in general rings (e.g., if R has zero divisors), but the specific
            example given in step 5 fails to demonstrate this. The mistake in presenting
            a non-counterexample as a counterexample introduces an error that is not
            addressed in subsequent steps, leading to an incorrect conclusion about
            Statement 2 being false. Since the validity of the conclusion depends

            the example itself (from step 5) is not a valid counterexample to Statement
            2 (since it satisfies the degree formula), step 6 is faithful to the calculations
            in the example. The error lies in step 5's choice of example, not in step
            6's arithmetic or logic. Step 7 later clarifies that the degree formula
            can fail in other rings, which is correct. Thus, step 6 is not unfaithful

            correctly counts these reverse pairs (totaling 5 unfavorable outcomes

          explanation: The step <step-3> claims that for the p-norm to be expressible
            as an inner product, it must satisfy ||x||_p2 = ||x||_22. This is incorrect
            reasoning. The correct condition for a norm to be induced by an inner
            product is that it satisfies the parallelogram law, not equality to the
            Euclidean norm. The error arises because the step conflates the general
            requirement for a norm to be induced by an inner product (parallelogram
            law) with the specific case of the Euclidean norm. While the conclusion
            (p=2) is ultimately correct, the reasoning in this step misrepresents
            the mathematical justification. The equation ||x||_p2 = ||x||_22 is only
            valid if the inner product is assumed to be the standard Euclidean one,
            which is not required by the problem statement. This introduces a flawed
            premise that could mislead the reasoning process, even though the final
