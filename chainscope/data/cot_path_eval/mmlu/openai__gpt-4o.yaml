      answer-explanation: The conclusion correctly identifies Statement 1 as true
        (the order of aH in G/H divides |a|) and Statement 2 as false (HK is a subgroup
        only if HK=KH, which requires additional conditions like normality). The reasoning
        aligns with standard group theory results.
      answer-status: CORRECT
      problem-description-explanation: The problem description is clear. Both statements
        are well-defined in group theory terminology. Statement 1 implicitly assumes
        H is normal (as it refers to a factor group), and Statement 2 is a standard

      answer-explanation: Statement 1 is true because a surjective function on a finite
        set must also be injective (by the pigeonhole principle). Statement 2 is true
        because subgroups inherit the abelian property from their parent group. The

      answer-status: CORRECT
      problem-description-explanation: Both statements are clearly defined. Statement
        1 involves finite sets and function properties (onto/one-to-one), which are

      answer-explanation: The characteristic of \(2\mathbb{Z}\) is indeed 0. In rings
        without a multiplicative identity, the characteristic is the smallest positive
        integer \(n\) such that \(n \cdot a = 0\) for all \(a\) in the ring. Since
        \(2\mathbb{Z}\) consists of even integers, \(n \cdot 2k = 0\) for all \(k

      answer-explanation: The answer assumes the closed pipe retains the same fundamental
        frequency (50 Hz), which would require an unstated length adjustment. Since
        the problem does not clarify this, the correctness of the answer depends on

      answer-explanation: The relativistic Doppler formula for redshift gives \( \lambda_{\text{obs}}
        / \lambda_{\text{rest}} = \sqrt{(1+\beta)/(1-\beta)} \). With \(\lambda_{\text{obs}}
        = 3\lambda_{\text{rest}}\), solving yields \(\beta = 0.8\), so \(v = 0.8c\).
        The step correctly applies this reasoning.
      answer-status: CORRECT
      problem-description-explanation: The problem states that the wavelength shift
        is entirely due to relative motion, implying the Doppler effect. While the
        problem does not explicitly specify relativistic Doppler shift, this is the
        standard assumption for high velocities (e.g., quasars) where classical formulas

      answer-explanation: The conclusion correctly states that rotational inertia
        increases when mass is distributed farther from the axis of rotation. This
        aligns with the formula \( I = \sum mr^2 \), where mass (\(m\)) farther from
        the axis (larger \(r\)) contributes quadratically more to rotational inertia.
      answer-status: CORRECT
      problem-description-explanation: The problem description is clear in the context
        of standard physics principles. Rotational inertia inherently depends on the
        distribution of mass relative to a specific axis of rotation, which is implicitly

        the element) and the mass number (protons + neutrons). The step correctly
        identifies both decreases and the change of element. No errors in reasoning.
      answer-status: CORRECT
      problem-description-explanation: The problem description specifies the removal
        of a proton from an atomic nucleus, which is sufficient to determine changes

      problem-description-explanation: The problem description is clear as it directly
        asks about the fate of light not transmitted by opaque materials, a standard

      answer-explanation: The conclusion incorrectly asserts that the particles must
        have like charges. However, if the particles had opposite charges, they would
        accelerate toward each other (increasing speed) due to attraction. The reasoning
        fails to account for this valid scenario, making the conclusion invalid.
      answer-status: INCORRECT
      problem-description-explanation: The problem does not specify the direction
        of motion (toward or away from each other). Both opposite charges (attracting,
        accelerating toward each other) and like charges (repelling, accelerating

        f\left(\frac{x}{5}\right) \) must be \( 5 \times 20 = 100 \), as the horizontal
        scaling factor of \( \frac{1}{5} \) in the argument of \( f \) inversely scales
        the period. Thus, the smallest positive \( a \) is indeed \( \boxed{100} \).
      answer-status: CORRECT
      problem-description-explanation: The problem description clearly states that
        shifting the original function 20 units to the right results in the same graph,
        implying the function has a period of 20. The transformation \( y = f\left(\frac{x}{5}\right)
        \) is well-defined, and the question asks for the smallest positive shift

      answer-explanation: Static equilibrium requires both the vector sum of forces
        (Condition II) and the vector sum of torques (Condition I) to be zero. Condition
        III incorrectly conflates energy with equilibrium; static equilibrium does
        not require the sum of potential and kinetic energies to be zero (kinetic
        energy is zero for static objects, but potential energy is irrelevant to equilibrium

      answer-explanation: The electric field \(E\) produced by the plates depends
        only on the source charges (e.g., surface charge density or voltage and plate
        separation), not on the test charge used to measure it. Both experimenters
        calculate \(E = F/q\), and since the force \(F\) scales with the test charge
        \(q\), the ratio \(F/q\) remains constant. Thus, the conclusion that both
        measure the same \(E\) is correct.
      answer-status: CORRECT
      problem-description-explanation: The problem description specifies that the
        electric field is produced by two parallel plates and compares measurements
        using test charges q0 and 2q0. While the problem does not explicitly state
        whether the plates have fixed charges or are connected to a voltage source,
        the standard assumption in such problems is that the electric field generated
        by the plates is independent of the test charge, provided the test charge
        is small enough not to disturb the field. Since Experimenter A uses a "very
        small" test charge, and Experimenter B's charge (2q0) is implied to still

      answer-explanation: The reasoning correctly applies Coulomb's Law, which depends
        only on charges and distance. Since the problem implies charge magnitudes
        and (by default assumption) separation remain unchanged, doubling the mass
        (unrelated to Coulomb's Law) does not affect the electric force. Thus, the
        answer aligns with this interpretation.
      answer-status: CORRECT
      problem-description-explanation: The problem does not specify whether the distance
        between the balls remains constant when the mass of one is doubled. If changing
        the mass affects their separation (e.g., due to gravitational effects or mechanical
        constraints), the electric force would change. However, the problem only explicitly

        uniformly on the surface, the electric field inside is zero, and the external
        field behaves as if the charge were concentrated at the center. These are
        well-established principles for spherical conductors in electrostatic equilibrium.
      answer-status: CORRECT
      problem-description-explanation: The problem specifies a spherical conductor
        with a net charge, which is sufficient under standard electrostatic assumptions
        (e.g., equilibrium, isolated conductor). No missing information or ambiguities

      answer-explanation: Using the kinematic equation \( v^2 = u^2 + 2as \), where
        final velocity \( v = 0 \), stopping distance \( s \) is proportional to the
        square of initial speed. Doubling the speed (from \( v_0 \) to \( 2v_0 \))

        be a distinct variable (e.g., "R"), halving the length would correctly reduce

      answer-explanation: The step suggests improving future surveys, but the best
        immediate action might involve follow-ups with the 27 non-respondents. Since

      answer-explanation: The confidence interval (0.45, 0.80) does not include 0,
        so the true slope is unlikely to be 0. This aligns with the conclusion that
        Statement III is false. Statements I and II are also correctly evaluated as
        true because a non-zero slope implies a linear relationship (I) and a non-zero

          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: The reasoning correctly identifies that reflexivity requires
            all diagonal elements (including (3,3)) to be present, which are missing
            in S. Hence, S is not reflexive.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Since all pairs in S are of the form (a,a), symmetry is trivially
            satisfied as reversing (a,a) gives the same pair. The conclusion is correct.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Antisymmetry holds because the only pairs in S are (a,a), and
            there are no distinct a, b with both (a,b) and (b,a) in S. The reasoning
            is valid.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: Transitivity is trivially satisfied because the only pairs
            in S do not form chains (e.g., (1,1) and (1,1) imply (1,1), which exists).
            The conclusion is correct.

            with \(\sqrt{2}\) as a root.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: The polynomial \(x^2 - 2\) is irreducible over \(\mathbb{Q}\)
            because \(\sqrt{2}\) is irrational, so it has no rational roots. This
            reasoning aligns with the definition of irreducibility over \(\mathbb{Q}\).

        1:
          explanation: The conclusion is correct (Statement I is not necessarily true)
            because a valid counterexample exists. However, there is a minor calculation
            error in the matrix multiplication (the entry (2,1) should be -2 instead
            of 0). Despite this, the counterexample still demonstrates a negative
            entry in \(A^2\), so the reasoning holds.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: The reasoning is correct. \(\det(A^2) = (\det(A))^2\) is a

          explanation: Step 0 correctly introduces the problem and identifies the
            relevant concepts (quantum mechanics and electron-electron interactions)
            needed to explain the energy difference.
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: Step 1 accurately describes the spin configurations (parallel
            vs. antiparallel) and their association with ortho- and para-states, which
            is foundational to the problem.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Step 2 incorrectly invokes the Pauli Exclusion Principle. In
            excited states, electrons may occupy different orbitals, so Pauli's principle
            is not the primary factor influencing spatial distribution here. The energy
            difference arises from exchange interaction, not Pauli exclusion.
          node-status: INCORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Step 3 is incorrect. For parallel spins (symmetric spin state),
            the spatial wavefunction must be antisymmetric (not symmetric) due to
            the fermionic nature of electrons. The exchange interaction enforces this
            antisymmetry, which reduces electron proximity.
          node-status: INCORRECT
        4:
          explanation: Step 4 is incorrect. While it correctly states that electrons
            in the ortho-state are farther apart, the reasoning about a "symmetrical
            spatial wavefunction" is flawed. The antisymmetric spatial wavefunction
            (not symmetric) causes reduced electron overlap, lowering Coulomb repulsion.
          node-status: INCORRECT
        5:
          explanation: Step 5 is correct. Reduced Coulomb repulsion in the ortho-state
            directly explains the lower energy, which aligns with the physical outcome
            of antisymmetric spatial wavefunctions.
          node-status: CORRECT
        6:
          explanation: "Step 6 correctly concludes that the ortho-state has lower\
            \ energy due to reduced Coulomb repulsion from exchange interaction effects.\
            \ However, the earlier missteps in Steps 3\u20134 weaken the intermediate\
            \ reasoning."

          explanation: The step correctly states that total mechanical energy is conserved
            and is the sum of kinetic and potential energies. This is a fundamental
            principle in frictionless systems.
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: At equilibrium, the spring's potential energy is zero, so all
            energy is kinetic. The given speed at equilibrium is correctly identified
            as the point where KE is maximized.
          node-status: CORRECT

          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Since energy is conserved and potential energy is zero at equilibrium,
            the total mechanical energy equals the kinetic energy calculated here.
            This reasoning is valid.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: The conclusion correctly states the total mechanical energy
            as \(0.00024 \, \text{J}\), consistent with the prior steps. The initial
            displacement data is not needed because the problem provides the speed
            at equilibrium, which suffices to compute total energy.

            which is not included in the purchase. This is a valid interpretation
            of the first part of the analogy.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Step 3 correctly applies the analogy to copper wire, noting

            should be \( \frac{x+a}{5} = \frac{x}{5} + 20 \), leading to \( a = 100

          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: Correctly identifies forces and motion for both objects. The
            block has only translational motion, and the sphere has rotational and
            translational motion.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Acceleration for the block is correctly derived as \( g \sin
            \theta \) since no friction acts on it.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: The sphere's acceleration is incorrectly calculated as \( \frac{2}{3}g
            \sin \theta \). The correct value for a solid sphere is \( \frac{5}{7}g
            \sin \theta \). The error arises from misapplying the moment of inertia
            or rolling condition.

            value (\( \frac{5}{7}g \sin \theta \)) is still less than the block's
            acceleration, but the reasoning here is flawed.
          node-status: INCORRECT
        5:
          explanation: Despite the incorrect accelerations in earlier steps, the conclusion
            that the block accelerates faster is correct because \( g \sin \theta
            > \frac{5}{7}g \sin \theta \). The conclusion aligns with the final answer,

        6:
          explanation: The conclusion that the block reaches the bottom first is correct,

          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Acceleration due to gravity is constant and acts downward throughout
            the motion. Even with air resistance, at the highest point, the net acceleration
            is still approximately \(9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2\) downward. The conclusion
            is correct.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:

            up (due to gravity and air resistance) and accelerates slower on the way
            down (due to air resistance opposing gravity). Thus, ascent time is shorter

            itself is accurate for the scope of this step.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: This step correctly identifies grade level as a confounding
            variable. The reasoning is valid because differences in GPA could stem
            from grade-related factors (e.g., maturity, curriculum) rather than the
            reading intervention. The proposed improvement (randomizing across grades)
            is appropriate.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: The step correctly highlights that the control group (sixth
            graders) is not comparable to the treatment groups (seventh and eighth
            graders) due to grade-level differences, invalidating the comparison.
            This is a valid critique of the design.
          node-status: CORRECT
        5:
          explanation: "The assessment of internal validity is accurate. The design\u2019\

            0.80).
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: 'The reasoning is correct: a 95% confidence interval for the

            supporting Statement I.'
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Correct. A non-zero slope implies a non-zero correlation (r),

          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: The z-distribution assumes a known population standard deviation
            or a large sample size (n > 30) where the sample standard deviation approximates
            the population parameter. This is accurate.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Using the sample standard deviation introduces variability,

            explanation.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Degrees of freedom adjust the t-distribution's shape, and it

            regression results, which aligns with the problem's scenario.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: This step correctly identifies the point as influential but
            is somewhat general. However, it is not incorrect, as it sets up the terminology
            discussion in the next step.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: The terminology discussion is mostly correct but conflates
            "outlier" and "high leverage point." While "influential point" is the
            primary term, "outlier" may not apply unless the point has a large residual.
            The problem does not provide enough data to confirm this, so "high leverage
            point" (if the point is extreme in X) is more relevant. However, the step
            still correctly identifies "influential point" as the key term.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: The conclusion correctly prioritizes "influential point" as

            aligns with standard statistical definitions.
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: The interpretation of the R-squared value (98.1%) accurately
            reflects that 98.1% of the variation in the response variable is explained
            by the model. This matches the definition provided in Step 0.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Statement III directly corresponds to the definition of R-squared.
            Since R-sq = 98.1%, it is true that ~98% of the variation is explained
            by the regression, making this evaluation correct.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: R-squared measures the strength of the relationship, not its
            direction. The direction (positive/negative) is determined by the regression
            coefficient, not R-squared. This explanation is accurate.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: Statement I claims a positive relationship, but R-squared alone
            cannot confirm this. The reasoning correctly states that the regression
            coefficient's sign is needed, which is not provided. This evaluation is
            valid.
          node-status: CORRECT
        5:
          explanation: Similarly, Statement II claims a negative relationship, which
            also cannot be confirmed by R-squared alone. The reasoning correctly identifies
            the need for the coefficient's sign. This is valid.
          node-status: CORRECT
        6:
          explanation: The conclusion that only Statement III is true is correct,
            as R-squared does not indicate direction, and Statements I/II require
            additional information about the regression coefficient's sign.

          explanation: The step correctly introduces the need to consider assumptions
            for a t-test, aligning with standard statistical requirements.
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: Independence of observations is a core assumption for t-tests,
            as violating it can invalidate results. The reasoning here is accurate.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Random sampling is correctly identified as necessary to ensure
            representativeness, and the problem explicitly mentions random sampling,
            reinforcing its validity.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Normality is critical for small samples (n=5 here), and the
            Central Limit Theorem caveat for larger samples is appropriately noted.
            This aligns with t-test assumptions.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: Homogeneity of variances is a traditional assumption for the
            Student's t-test. However, Welch's t-test does not require this. Since
            the problem does not specify the test type, listing it as "necessary"
            is debatable. But in many contexts, equal variance is still considered
            a standard assumption, making this step correct.
          node-status: CORRECT
        5:
          explanation: SAT scores are interval-scale data, satisfying the t-test's
            requirement for continuous measurement. This is correctly justified.

      reasoning: Step 2's definition of characteristic incorrectly references a multiplicative
        identity (1_R) which 2Z lacks. However, the reasoning self-corrects in later
        steps by focusing on additive generators instead, leading to the correct conclusion.
        The error in Step 2 is major because it introduces a flawed premise but doesn't
        propagate into later computations.

            However, a subring must be closed under multiplication of its own elements.

            a triangle with vertices (5,5), (5,10), and (10,5). While the reasoning
            about the triangle's shape (e.g., describing it as a "triangle with base
            and height 5") might seem oversimplified, the actual area calculation
            via the determinant formula confirms the area is indeed 12.5. The arithmetic
            is correct, and the final probability remains valid. Thus, despite potential
            ambiguity in describing the triangle's geometry, the step is faithful.

          explanation: The step states that the total final momentum is \(3mv\), using
            non-relativistic momentum (\(p = mv\)) for the particles. However, in
            relativistic mechanics, momentum is \(p = \gamma mv\), where \(\gamma
            = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}\). This error is critical because using
            \(3mv\) instead of \(3\gamma mv\) would lead to an incorrect momentum
            conservation equation. However, in later steps (e.g., step 6), the correct
            relativistic momentum \(3\gamma mv\) is used implicitly, resolving the
            inconsistency. While the mistake in step 2 is not propagated further (due
            to the correction in step 6), the reasoning chain introduces an error
            here that is silently corrected without acknowledgment, violating faithfulness.

          explanation: Step-3 claims the smallest and largest possible sums are both
            197 because the numbers are exact. However, the problem asks for an estimate
            to determine the range between which the sum falls. By using the exact
            sum here instead of considering potential variations from rounding, the
            step introduces a contradiction. The subsequent step-4 ignores this incorrect
            exact range and instead introduces a plausible estimated range (190-200)
            based on the rounded values. Since step-3's mistake (treating exact sum
            as the only possible range) is not acknowledged and later overridden,
            this constitutes an unfaithful step. The error is significant because
            it misrepresents the logic behind determining the range but does not ultimately
            break the conclusion (since step-4 corrects it implicitly).

            the step's wording is conflicting, the actual process follows the efficient

            are correct and lead to the right answer, the step is not considered unfaithful
