        Finite fields must have prime power order (p^n), and 60 is not a prime power.
        While the step initially confuses groups (e.g., PSL2) with fields, it ultimately

      answer-explanation: The order of an element in S5 is the LCM of its cycle lengths.
        The permutation (1 2 3)(4 5) has cycle lengths 3 and 2, giving LCM(3,2)=6.
        This is indeed the maximum possible in S5, as other cycle structures yield

      answer-explanation: Statement 1 is true by the Riemann rearrangement theorem,

        number (including 4). Statement 2 is true because in non-compact metric spaces
        (e.g., infinite-dimensional spaces), a closed and bounded set under a continuous
        map may have an unbounded or non-closed image, such as the identity map on
        the closed unit ball in an infinite-dimensional space mapped to itself in
        a non-compact space, resulting in an image that is closed and bounded but

      answer-explanation: Bernoulli's principle states that an increase in fluid velocity
        corresponds to a decrease in pressure, assuming steady, incompressible flow.
        The reasoning correctly applies this principle to conclude that increased
        wind speed over the hill leads to decreased atmospheric pressure. No conflicting
        factors (e.g., elevation changes) are mentioned in the problem to invalidate
        this conclusion.
      answer-status: CORRECT
      problem-description-explanation: The problem description states that wind speeds
        up over a hill and asks about the resulting atmospheric pressure. While real-world
        atmospheric dynamics involve complexities (e.g., elevation, compressibility),
        the problem is framed in a standard context where Bernoulli's principle is

      answer-explanation: The reasoning assumes the rose is illuminated by white light
        (where red wavelengths are reflected), but since the problem description does
        not explicitly state the light source, the conclusion depends on an unverified
        assumption. If the incident light lacked red wavelengths, the conclusion would
        be incorrect.
      answer-status: UNCERTAIN
      problem-description-explanation: The problem does not specify the color of the
        incident light (e.g., white light), which is critical to determining the reflected

      answer-explanation: The normal force must be perpendicular to the cone's surface,
        angled inwards and upwards. Its vertical component balances gravity (mg),
        and its horizontal component provides centripetal force. The magnitude of
        the normal force is the vector sum of these components, making it larger than
        mg. The reasoning correctly identifies these aspects.
      answer-status: CORRECT
      problem-description-explanation: The problem description specifies a ball in
        horizontal circular motion inside a cone, which inherently defines the geometry.
        While parameters like cone angle, speed, or radius are not explicitly given,
        the question focuses on the qualitative nature of the normal force (direction

        (vs. mercury's 0.76 meters) to balance atmospheric pressure. The conclusion
        that the water barometer is "taller" aligns with this calculation.

      problem-description-explanation: "The problem assumes standard knowledge about\
        \ barometers and fluid densities. While explicit densities are not provided,\

      answer-explanation: The reasoning correctly applies Newton's second law (F =

        as amplitude directly correlates with the wave's energy and perceived volume.
        The reasoning correctly identifies amplitude as the key factor.
      answer-status: CORRECT
      problem-description-explanation: The problem asks for the property of a sound
        wave most closely related to loudness. While the question is open-ended (no
        multiple-choice options provided), it is a standard physics concept where
        "amplitude" is the direct answer. No critical information is missing for this

        (9.8 + 4.0) = 5.0 \times 13.8 = 69 \, \text{N} \), which matches the stated
        answer of 69 N.
      answer-status: CORRECT
      problem-description-explanation: The problem provides the mass (5.0 kg), elevator
        acceleration (4.0 m/s2 upward), and asks for apparent weight. While the value
        of gravitational acceleration (g) is not explicitly stated, it is standard
        in physics problems to assume g = 9.8 m/s2 unless specified otherwise. Thus,
        all necessary information is implicitly present.

        point (though this depends on interpretation). Alternatively, if analyzing

        state whether the number of moles (n) is held constant. While the first step
        (invoking the ideal gas law) is correct, the missing information about n makes
        the final answer uncertain, as n could theoretically change and affect the
        pressure calculation.
      answer-status: UNCERTAIN
      problem-description-explanation: The problem does not specify whether the number
        of moles (n) of the gas remains constant. Since the ideal gas law (PV = nRT)
        depends on n, this missing information makes the problem incomplete. Without
        knowing if n changes, the pressure cannot be definitively determined.

        photon energy (determined by wavelength), not intensity. Since no electrons

        the stability and reliability of r (e.g., small samples may produce extreme

        quantifies the probability of observing the data (or more extreme) assuming
        the null hypothesis is true, not the probability the null is true. It also

      answer-explanation: A higher confidence level requires a wider interval to account
        for greater certainty. The 95% confidence interval uses a larger critical
        value (e.g., t-score or z-score) than the 90% interval, resulting in a wider
        range. This aligns with the conclusion in the last step.

      problem-description-explanation: The problem description provides all necessary
        information to compare confidence interval widths. The key factors (confidence
        level, regression slope, and sample context) are specified. The comparison
        between 90% and 95% confidence levels is unambiguous, as interval width directly
        depends on the confidence level when other parameters (e.g., sample size,

          explanation: The Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups
            states that any abelian group of order 45 is cyclic (isomorphic to Z_45),
            as 45 = 32 * 5 and 9 and 5 are coprime. Listing Z_9 x Z_5 as a separate
            case is redundant since it is isomorphic to Z_45. Thus, the step incorrectly
            presents two structures when there's only one.
          node-status: INCORRECT
        1:
          explanation: Z_45 is cyclic, and cyclic groups have exactly one subgroup
            for each divisor of their order. Since 10 does not divide 45, Z_45 cannot
            have a subgroup of order 10. This reasoning is correct.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: In Z_9 x Z_5, subgroups must have orders that are products
            of divisors of 9 and 5. Since 10 cannot be formed from these divisors
            (e.g., 2 is not a divisor of 9 or 5), no subgroup of order 10 exists.
            This is valid reasoning.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Since neither Z_45 nor Z_9 x Z_5 (which are actually the same
            group) have a subgroup of order 10, Statement 1 is false. The conclusion
            is correct despite the earlier misstep in group classification.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: In finite groups, the number of left and right cosets (the
            index) is always equal to |G|/|H| by Lagrange's theorem. This equality
            holds regardless of normality, making the "if and only if" in Statement
            2 invalid. The reasoning here is accurate.
          node-status: CORRECT
        5:
          explanation: While normal subgroups have identical left/right cosets, the
            mere equality in their count does not imply normality. The example of
            a non-normal subgroup in A_4 with equal coset counts is valid and supports
            the argument. This step is correct.
          node-status: CORRECT
        6:
          explanation: Since the equality of left and right coset numbers does not

          explanation: The step correctly identifies that a permutation is a bijection
            (both one-to-one and onto), hence it must be one-to-one. This aligns with
            the definition of a permutation, making the conclusion valid.
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: The step provides a valid counterexample where a one-to-one
            function is not onto, hence not a permutation. This correctly refutes

          explanation: The reasoning correctly differentiates between the definitions
            of ideals and subrings. It highlights that ideals don't need to contain
            the multiplicative identity, which is a valid point. The examples provided
            (e.g., {0} and 2Z) support the conclusion. The conclusion aligns with

          explanation: Statement 1 is correctly identified as false, as the order
            of ab in an abelian group isn't always the lcm of |a| and |b|.
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: The Klein four-group example does not contradict Statement
            1 since |ab| equals the lcm(|a|,|b|). This is an incorrect counterexample.
          node-status: INCORRECT
        2:
          explanation: The Z_6 example also supports Statement 1, as |a+b| equals

          explanation: The counterexample provided is flawed. The first part uses
            H=A3 (normal in G=S3) and maps to Z2, where f(H) is normal. The second
            part incorrectly uses a non-normal H' in G, which doesn't satisfy the
            original statement's premise that H is normal in G. A valid counterexample

          explanation: The example provided correctly demonstrates that B can be disconnected
            even if A and C are connected. Removing a point from the interval (0,2)
            splits it into two disconnected parts, making B disconnected. The reasoning

        1:
          explanation: The example uses a particular point topology but incorrectly
            claims B is not compact. In this topology, any set containing the particular
            point (1) is open. For B = {1, 2}, the open cover must include a set containing
            1, which would also cover 2, making B compact. The example is flawed,

          explanation: The step correctly identifies the two right ideals as {0} and
            R, which are always present in any ring. This is a valid starting point.
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: aR is indeed a right ideal because it is closed under addition
            and right multiplication by elements of R. This is a standard result in
            ring theory.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Since R has only two right ideals and a is nonzero, aR cannot
            be {0}, so it must equal R. This follows directly from the given conditions.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Because aR = R, there exists an r such that ar = 1. This correctly

          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: Ra is shown to be a right ideal, and since a is nonzero, Ra
            = R. This implies a left inverse exists. The reasoning about Ra being
            a right ideal is valid due to closure under right multiplication.
          node-status: CORRECT
        5:
          explanation: By equating the left and right inverses using associativity,

          explanation: The step correctly states that a tree with 5 vertices has 4
            edges, which follows from the property of trees (n-1 edges).
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: The step correctly applies the Handshaking Lemma and verifies
            that all vertices have at least degree 1, leading to a valid sum of degrees
            (8).
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: The step lists (4,1,1,1,1), (3,2,1,1,1), and (2,2,2,1,1) as
            possible degree sequences. However, the claim that (2,2,2,1,1) corresponds
            to two non-isomorphic trees is incorrect. Only the path graph (one tree)
            has this degree sequence. The other proposed tree actually belongs to
            the (3,2,1,1,1) sequence, making this step flawed.
          node-status: INCORRECT
        3:
          explanation: The diagrams for (4,1,1,1,1) and (3,2,1,1,1) are correct. However,
            the second diagram under (2,2,2,1,1) is invalid, as it represents a tree
            with degree sequence (3,2,1,1,1), not (2,2,2,1,1). This misrepresentation
            invalidates the step.
          node-status: INCORRECT
        4:
          explanation: While the final answer (3) is correct, the reasoning is flawed
            due to the incorrect count of trees for the (2,2,2,1,1) sequence. The
            conclusion contradicts the earlier steps, making the step's logic incorrect

          explanation: Statement 1 is correctly identified as true. The Heine-Cantor
            theorem indeed states that a continuous function on a compact metric space
            is uniformly continuous, which aligns with the reasoning.
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: The justification correctly references the Heine-Cantor theorem
            and accurately connects compactness to uniform continuity. This is a valid
            application of the theorem.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Statement 2 is correctly identified as true. The chain rule
            ensures that the composition of two everywhere differentiable functions
            is differentiable everywhere, as the derivatives required for the chain
            rule exist globally.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: The justification correctly invokes the chain rule. Since both
            f and g are everywhere differentiable, their composition f(g(x)) is differentiable
            everywhere, and the derivative formula holds. There are no hidden conditions
            here that would invalidate the conclusion.

          explanation: The step correctly identifies that a bijection between (0,1)
            and (0,1] is possible by constructing a piecewise function, which addresses
            the cardinality argument. The example, while complex, aligns with the

          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: The image (0,1] is not compact because it is not closed in

          explanation: The Pauli Exclusion Principle is correctly stated. Electrons
            with the same spatial wavefunction must have opposite spins, which is
            foundational to understanding the spatial distribution differences between
            ortho- and parahelium.
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: Orthohelium (parallel spins) requires electrons to occupy different
            spatial orbitals due to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, reducing electron-electron
            repulsion. Parahelium (antiparallel spins) allows electrons to share the
            same spatial orbital, increasing repulsion. This reasoning aligns with
            the symmetry of spatial wavefunctions dictated by spin states.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Increased electron-electron repulsion directly correlates with
            higher energy due to greater potential energy. This is a valid connection,

          explanation: A reversible process indeed allows both the system and surroundings
            to return to their initial states without any net changes, as no entropy

          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: Reversible processes are quasi-static (proceeding through equilibrium

            the process. This is a correct characterization of reversibility.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Reversible processes maximize work output (or minimize work
            input) because they avoid energy losses. The system being in near-equilibrium

          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Replacing the Sun with a same-mass black hole does not alter

            radius does not affect the mass value in the gravitational formula.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: In Newtonian gravity, the force depends only on mass and distance,
            not the object's size. At planetary distances (far larger than the Schwarzschild
            radius), relativistic effects are negligible, so the reasoning holds.

          explanation: The definition correctly states that a reversible process can
            be reversed by an infinitesimal change and restores both system and surroundings
            to their original states, aligning with thermodynamic principles.
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: In a reversible process, the system remains in thermodynamic
            equilibrium with its surroundings at every stage, as any imbalance would
            introduce irreversibility. This is a key characteristic of reversible
            processes.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Thermodynamic equilibrium indeed implies no unbalanced forces
            (mechanical equilibrium) and no temperature differences (thermal equilibrium),
            ensuring no spontaneous heat flow. This is consistent with the definition
            of equilibrium.

        3:
          explanation: Dissipative effects like friction or finite-temperature heat
            transfer are absent in reversible processes because such effects inherently

        4:
          explanation: For reversible processes, entropy generation (S_gen) is zero.
            The system's entropy change may occur due to heat exchange, but the surroundings'
            entropy change cancels it, resulting in a total entropy change of zero.

            The reasoning is accurate.
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: The step correctly states that a closed pipe supports only

            formula application are accurate.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: None of the original open pipe harmonics (50 Hz, 100 Hz, etc.)
            match the closed pipe's odd multiples of 25 Hz. The comparison is valid.
          node-status: CORRECT
        5:

          explanation: Electrons are fermions and indeed follow Fermi-Dirac statistics
            due to the Pauli exclusion principle, which prohibits multiple fermions
            from occupying the same quantum state. This is a fundamental concept in
            quantum statistics.
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: The Pauli exclusion principle forces electrons to fill energy
            levels up to the Fermi energy (E<sub>F</sub>) even at absolute zero. This
            is a correct description of the Fermi energy's origin in metals.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Fermi energies in metals (several eV) are indeed orders of
            magnitude larger than kT at room temperature (~0.026 eV). The comparison
            is accurate and well-established.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: At absolute zero, the mean kinetic energy of electrons in a
            free electron model is (3/5)E<sub>F</sub>. Even at finite temperatures
            (e.g., room temperature), thermal effects are negligible compared to E<sub>F</sub>,
            so the mean energy remains close to this value. The statement is correct.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: Since E<sub>F</sub> >> kT, the mean kinetic energy (a fraction
            of E<sub>F</sub>) is indeed much larger than kT. This conclusion logically
            follows from the previous steps and explains the observed properties of
            metals.

          explanation: The Doppler effect equation used here is incorrect. When the
            source and observer are stationary relative to each other and the medium
            (air) is moving (wind), the frequency does not change. The wind affects
            the speed of sound relative to the ground but does not cause a Doppler

            portion.'
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Step 2 correctly states that higher altitudes have thinner

          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: 'Step 3 is correct: Heavier particles like alpha particles

            stopped by the atmosphere.'
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: Step 4 is incorrect. While neutrons penetrate deeply due to
            being neutral, protons (charged) interact more and are less penetrating.
            The reasoning incorrectly attributes penetration to being "lighter," but
            protons and neutrons have similar masses. The key factor is charge, not
            mass.
          node-status: INCORRECT
        5:

        6:
          explanation: Step 6 is correct. At high altitudes, secondary particles like
            neutrons (from nuclear interactions) and muons (from pion decay) dominate
            due to their penetrating nature, making them the predominant radiation

          explanation: In a series circuit, components are connected in a single path,
            so current flows through each sequentially. This aligns with the definition
            of a series circuit.
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: Series circuits lack branching paths, meaning current cannot
            split or diverge. This is a fundamental characteristic of series configurations.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Kirchhoff's Current Law ensures the current remains constant
            throughout a series circuit since there are no junctions for charge accumulation
            or diversion.
          node-status: CORRECT

          explanation: Thermal convection is indeed a heat transfer mechanism distinct
            from phase changes (which involve latent heat) and conduction (which requires
            direct contact). This step correctly differentiates convection from other
            heat transfer methods.
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: Convection does involve fluid movement (liquid or gas) driven
            by density differences. This is a fundamental characteristic of convection,
            distinguishing it from conduction or radiation.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Density differences in convection are caused by temperature
            variations. Warmer fluid being less dense and rising, while cooler fluid
            sinks, is a correct description of the buoyancy-driven flow in convection.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:

          explanation: "The hydrostatic pressure formula P = P0 + \u03C1gh is correctly\
            \ stated and relevant to determining the factors affecting pressure at\
            \ the bottom of a pond."
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: "P0, \u03C1, and g are constants in this context, and h (depth)\
            \ is the variable influencing pressure. This reasoning is accurate."
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: The formula indeed lacks terms for surface area, volume, or
            shape, which aligns with the principle that hydrostatic pressure depends
            on depth, not container geometry.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Since surface area is not part of the formula and the prior

          explanation: The principle that a mirror needs to be half the height of
            the face to see the entire face is correct. This is based on the law of
            reflection, where the distance from the eyes to the top/bottom of the
            face determines the required mirror height.
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: Steam on the mirror does not alter the reflection geometry.
            The angles of incidence and reflection remain valid, so the same half-height
            principle applies despite the obstruction.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Since the geometry requires half the face height, wiping a
            patch of that minimum height ensures the necessary reflections occur,
            allowing the full face to be seen.

          explanation: The problem involves a ball rolling on the inside of a cone.
            The reasoning identifies gravity and the normal force as the only forces.
            While rolling typically involves friction, the problem does not explicitly
            mention friction, and the focus is on the normal force. Thus, assuming
            no friction is reasonable here.
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: The normal force is correctly described as acting perpendicular

          explanation: The average kinetic energy of gas molecules is indeed proportional
            to temperature and the same for all gases at the same temperature, as
            per the equipartition theorem.
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: The formula KE = (1/2)mv2 correctly represents the kinetic
            energy of a single molecule, aligning with the kinetic theory of gases.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Since KE is constant, lighter molecules must have higher speeds
            to maintain the same KE. This follows directly from rearranging KE = (1/2)mv2.

          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: Hydrogen's lower mass leads to the highest average speed, as
            speed is inversely proportional to the square root of mass when KE is
            constant.

          explanation: An ideal transformer indeed assumes no losses, including core
            and winding losses. This is a correct description of an ideal transformer's
            properties.
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: Power conservation applies to ideal transformers because energy
            conservation holds, and in the absence of losses, input power equals output
            power. The statement is correct.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Since there are no losses (step-0) and power is conserved (step-1),

          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: At terminal velocity, acceleration is zero, so by Newton's
            first law, the net force must indeed be zero.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:

            the description in the step.
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: Electric potential energy depends on the position of a charge
            in an electric field, with energy increasing as distance decreases (for
            like charges). While the sign of charges affects the energy's sign, the

          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: At sunrise/sunset, sunlight traverses a longer atmospheric

          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: Earth's orbit would remain unchanged because gravitational
            force depends on the Sun's mass and Earth's orbital distance, both of
            which stay the same if the Sun becomes a black hole.

          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Friction opposes the direction of motion, which is positive
            x, so it acts in the negative x-direction. This is consistent with Newton's
            laws.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Vertical forces (gravity and normal force) cancel, leaving
            friction as the sole horizontal force. Thus, the net force is due to friction,
            acting horizontally.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: At x = 1.0 m, the puck is still moving forward but decelerating.

        1:
          explanation: The force on a test charge in an electric field is F = qE,

          node-status: CORRECT
        5:
          explanation: Since the electric field E is calculated as F/q, both experimenters

          explanation: The speed of sound in a medium like air is indeed determined
            by properties of the medium (e.g., temperature, density), not by the wave's

        1:
          explanation: "Frequency does not influence the speed of sound in a given\

            \ foundational physics and accurate."
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: The system is defined as the man and platform. A frictionless
            platform implies no external torques from the platform itself, so external
            torques must come from outside the system. This is correct.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Extending arms increases the moment of inertia. With no external
            torque, angular velocity decreases to conserve angular momentum. This
            aligns with the conservation principle and is correct.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Bringing arms in decreases the moment of inertia, increasing
            angular velocity to conserve angular momentum. This is the inverse of
            step 2 and is also correct.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: Changing arm position redistributes angular momentum within
            the system (man and platform) but does not alter the total angular momentum.
            This is accurate, as internal forces cannot change the system's total
            angular momentum.
          node-status: CORRECT
        5:
          explanation: Only external torques (e.g., tangential force or collision)
            can change the system's angular momentum. This conclusion is correct,
            as angular momentum conservation holds in the absence of external torques.

          explanation: Both pieces experience the same vertical motion after the split,
            so their remaining flight time is equal to the time the original projectile
            would take to fall from the peak. This is accurate.
          node-status: CORRECT
        5:
          explanation: The horizontal distance to the peak is half the total range
            (250 m) because the time to the peak is half the total flight time, and
            horizontal velocity is constant. Correct.
          node-status: CORRECT
        6:
          explanation: With doubled horizontal velocity (2v_x) and the same remaining
            flight time, the second piece travels twice the original horizontal distance
            (500 m) after the split. This reasoning is valid.
          node-status: CORRECT
        7:
          explanation: Summing the horizontal distance before (250 m) and after (500
            m) the split gives the correct total distance of 750 m for the second
            piece.

        5:
          explanation: Substituting \( \cos 90^\circ = 0 \) into the work formula

          node-status: CORRECT
        6:
          explanation: Since the instantaneous work is always zero, integrating over

            goal.
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: Blocking by exercise intensity is appropriate because it is
            a known confounding variable associated with cholesterol. Excluding sleep
            length as a blocking variable is also correct since it has no established
            association with cholesterol.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Random assignment within exercise intensity blocks ensures

            level. This aligns with the standard interpretation of confidence intervals.
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: Step 1 is correct. A higher confidence level (e.g., 99% vs.

            contains the true population proportion.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Step 2 is correct. To achieve higher confidence, the critical

          explanation: A simple random sample (SRS) indeed requires every individual
            in the population to have an equal probability of being selected. This
            definition is accurate.
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: The method described (selecting every 25th student) is systematic
            sampling, not simple random sampling. Systematic sampling uses a fixed
            interval, which distinguishes it from the randomness required for an SRS.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Students arriving together (e.g., via the same transportation)
            are likely clustered in time, making their selection probabilities correlated.
            This undermines the "equal and independent" selection requirement of an
            SRS.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: If arrival times correlate with specific traits (e.g., early
            arrivals for extracurriculars), systematic sampling may over/underrepresent
            those groups. This is a valid concern about bias in systematic sampling.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: Since the method introduces non-random patterns (e.g., clusters
            of students with correlated traits), not all students have equal, independent
            chances of selection. Thus, it is not an SRS.

          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: Highly paid administrators inflate the mean salary, which is

        4:
          explanation: The reasoning here is flawed. If all engineers in both offices

        1:
          explanation: The t-interval assumes normality. With a right-skewed population

            is correct.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: The reasoning assumes the outlier is in the sample, but with
            a large population (4,752), the probability of including the superintendent
            in a 20-person sample is very low. The outlier's impact on the sample
            is uncertain unless explicitly stated. Thus, this step is incorrect as
            it makes an unsupported assumption.
          node-status: INCORRECT
        3:

        0:
          explanation: Step 0 correctly states that measures of spread (variability)
            become zero when all data points are identical, as there is no variation.
            This is a foundational understanding in statistics.
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: Step 1 accurately lists measures of spread (range, variance,
            standard deviation, IQR) and explains why they would be zero when all
            values are the same. All these measures depend on differences between

          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Step 3 is correct. The mean equals the common value of the

          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: Step 4 correctly concludes that the mean is the exception.
            All listed measures of spread are zero, while the mean retains the common
            value of the dataset. This aligns with the problem's requirements.

          explanation: The power of a test is indeed defined as the probability of
            correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false, which matches
            the standard statistical definition.
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: "Power is equivalent to 1 \u2212 \u03B2 (where \u03B2 is the\
            \ probability of a Type II error), so avoiding a Type II error directly\
            \ relates to the power of the test. This is accurate."
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: A higher power means the test is more likely to detect a true
            effect, which aligns with the interpretation of power as the test's sensitivity
            to real differences. Correct.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Summarizing power as the test's "ability to detect a true effect"

          explanation: A Type II error is correctly defined as failing to reject the
            null hypothesis when it is false. This aligns with the standard statistical
            definition.
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: The application to the context is accurate. Failing to reject
            H0 (equally effective) when Heartaid is actually more effective directly
            reflects a Type II error in this scenario.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: The consequences are logically derived. If a Type II error
            occurs, Heartaid (more effective) would not be adopted, leading to continued
            use of a less effective medication and financial loss for the company.
            These outcomes are valid and consistent with the error's definition.

        0:
          explanation: The step correctly identifies the problem as a one-tailed test
            (concern about lowered thrust), states the population and sample means,
            and the need to assess statistical significance. All elements are accurate.
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: The interpretation of the z-score is correct. A z-score of
            -2.46 means the sample mean is 2.46 standard deviations below the population
            mean, which aligns with the definition of a z-score in hypothesis testing.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: The explanation of the P-value is precise. It correctly states
            that the P-value represents the probability of observing the sample mean
            (or a more extreme value) under the assumption that the null hypothesis
            (population mean = 9500) is true.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Assuming a common significance level (alpha = 0.05) is reasonable
            when none is specified. The comparison (0.0069 < 0.05) is valid and standard
            in hypothesis testing.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: The conclusion logically follows from the P-value being less
            than alpha. Rejecting the null hypothesis and concluding the thrust has
            decreased is consistent with the data and statistical reasoning.

          explanation: Step 0 correctly identifies that removing the point causes
            a substantial change in the slope, which is a key indicator of an influential
            point.
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: Step 1 accurately observes the increase in the magnitude of
            the correlation coefficient, reflecting a stronger linear relationship
            after removal.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: 'Step 2 correctly interprets the point''s influence: it weakens
            the linear relationship and pulls the slope, aligning with the definition
            of an influential point.'
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:

          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Adding a constant to every data point shifts the mean by that
            constant, which is a correct application of statistical properties.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Standard deviation measures spread, which is unaffected by
            adding a constant to all values. The reasoning aligns with the mathematical
            definition of standard deviation.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:

        0:
          explanation: The associate's method uses stratified sampling by dividing
            customers into letter groups. However, since each customer's chance depends
            on their group size, not all have equal selection probability. This violates
            simple random sampling requirements, making the step correct.
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: Stratifying by letters and sampling 4 per group disproportionately
            (regardless of group size) creates unequal selection probabilities. Customers
            in smaller letter groups have higher chances of being selected, introducing
            bias. This reasoning is valid.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Forcing 4 samples per letter artificially equalizes representation,
            which likely misrepresents the true customer name distribution. The sample

        1:
          explanation: Plan I samples from all students, including non-investors,
            leading to a diluted average. This reasoning is valid because non-investors

          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Restricting the range reduces variability, which can weaken

            illustration of this effect.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:

          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: The reasoning is correct. Since the confidence interval does
            not include zero, it suggests a statistically significant difference.
            Rejecting the null hypothesis (no difference) is appropriate here, as

            This aligns with the frequentist interpretation of confidence intervals.
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: Step 1 is correct. A single confidence interval does not guarantee
            the true mean lies within it; it is a realization of the process, and
            confidence intervals are probabilistic in the long run, not for individual
            instances.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Step 2 accurately distinguishes between the confidence level
            (long-run proportion of intervals containing the true mean) and the misinterpretation
            of probability for a single interval. This is a valid interpretation.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Step 3 correctly rejects the idea of a 95% probability for
            the true mean being in the specific interval. The true mean is fixed,
            and the interval either contains it or not. Probability applies to the

        3:
          explanation: Stratified sampling is often used to account for differences

            (r) in simple linear regression, so r2 = 0.71 is correct here.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Mathematically, r is the square root of R-squared. While the
            sign is not yet determined, the step is correct for the magnitude.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:

          node-status: CORRECT
        4:

          explanation: The definition of a simple random sample (SRS) provided is
            accurate, emphasizing equal probability for all individuals and equal
            chance for all possible subsets of the sample size. This aligns with standard
            definitions.
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: The analysis correctly identifies the method as selecting six
            employees from each of the five plants, which matches the problem description.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: The calculation of 6/200 (3/100) for the probability of selecting
            an individual within a plant is mathematically correct.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: The reasoning correctly concludes that all employees have the
            same probability (0.03) of being selected, as the sampling process is
            identical across all plants.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: The observation that not all possible samples (e.g., 30 employees
            from one plant) can occur under this method is valid. A true SRS requires
            all possible combinations to be equally likely, which this method violates.
          node-status: CORRECT
        5:
          explanation: The conclusion correctly identifies the method as a stratified
            random sample (not an SRS) because it enforces proportional sampling from
            each "stratum" (plant), restricting the possible samples.

            bias. This is a valid point.
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: A simple random sample (SRS) requires every U.S. adult to have
            an equal chance of selection. Sampling only at a Wall Street location
            excludes most of the population, violating SRS principles.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: While the sample is biased, the criticism of the small size
            conflates bias with precision. The primary flaw is the non-representative
            sampling, not the size. A larger biased sample would still be biased.
          node-status: INCORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Non-response bias is possible even with a low rate, as non-respondents

        answer is connected. Critical errors occur in steps 6-8 due to incorrect claims
        about the closure of S', leading to wrong conclusions about density. However,
        steps 9 and 11 correctly state S is dense (though for the wrong reasons),
        and the final answer is wrong due to prior errors.

          explanation: "Step-5 calculates the number of half-cycles as 2 * 15.4 \u2248\
            \ 30.8, implying each half-cycle corresponds to an intersection. However,\
            \ this reasoning is flawed because intersections depend on the interaction\
            \ between y=x and the cosine wave's behavior, not merely the number of\
            \ half-cycles. The subsequent steps (step-6 and step-7) correct this by\
            \ explaining that the first half-cycle has one intersection and each full\
            \ cycle has two, leading to 15*2 +1 =31. While step-5's logic is incorrect\
            \ (equating half-cycles to intersections), the later steps override this\
            \ with valid reasoning. The error in step-5 does not propagate because\
            \ the subsequent steps use a different approach. However, the step itself\
            \ introduces a misleading justification, making it unfaithful."

          explanation: 'The step states that 20/8 represents a total divided into
            8 parts and considering 20 of them. This is mathematically incoherent:
            if a total is divided into 8 parts, there cannot be 20 parts. However,
            the subsequent step-2 correctly interprets 20/8 as dividing 20 items into
            8 equal portions (e.g., 20 cookies divided among 8 people). The initial
            error in step-0 introduces a contradiction (20 parts from 8 total parts)
            that is silently corrected in later steps without acknowledgment. While
            the final example in step-2 is valid, the reasoning in step-0 is fundamentally
            flawed and could mislead if taken literally.'

          explanation: The step initially claims 199 is not prime (incorrectly citing
            divisibility by 1, which applies to all integers), then immediately contradicts
            itself by correctly stating 199 is prime. While the initial reasoning
            is flawed, the correction occurs within the same step, and subsequent
            steps rely on the corrected conclusion (treating 199 as prime). The error
            does not propagate or affect the final answer, as the correct conclusion
            is retained. The mistake is verbal/descriptive but does not introduce
            mathematical inaccuracies in the overall reasoning chain.

            the initial claim is immediately addressed within the same step, and the
            correct conclusion (379 is prime) is used in subsequent reasoning. Since
            the error does not propagate and the final answer remains unaffected,
            the step is not unfaithful despite the internal contradiction.

        2:
          explanation: The step states that the region where \(x < y\) is below the
            line \(y = x\). This is incorrect because \(x < y\) corresponds to the
            region **above** the line \(y = x\). However, subsequent steps correctly
            identify the region as a triangle with vertices \((0,0)\), \((0,2)\),
            and \((2,2)\), which is indeed the area **above** \(y = x\) within the
            rectangle. The error in labeling the region as "below" does not propagate
            because the geometric analysis in later steps implicitly corrects it.
            The final area calculation and probability remain valid. The mistake is
            purely verbal and does not affect the mathematical logic or final answer.

          explanation: "Step 10 claims that \"we can't actually make all other gaps\
            \ 6 km\" because the excess distance is 46 km. This is incorrect. The\
            \ total minimum for all 9 gaps is 54 km (9 \xD7 6), and the actual total\
            \ is 100 km, leaving 46 km of excess. To maximize one gap, the other 8\
            \ gaps should be minimized to 6 km each (total 48 km), leaving 100 - 48\
            \ = 52 km for the target gap. This works because 52 km = 6 km (minimum)\
            \ + 46 km (excess), which fully utilizes the excess. Step 10 incorrectly\
            \ suggests this isn\u2019t possible, creating a contradiction that doesn\u2019\
            t exist. However, later steps ignore this error and correctly calculate\
            \ the maximum gap as 52 km. The mistake in step 10 is a major error in\
