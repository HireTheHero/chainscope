      answer-explanation: The polynomial x2 + 1 is irreducible over Z_3 (no roots
        in Z_3), making the quotient ring a field. For c=0 and c=2, the polynomials
        x2 and x2 + 2 have roots in Z_3, hence reducible. Thus, only c=1 is valid,

      answer-explanation: The reasoning correctly applies relativistic energy equations.
        The Lorentz factor for \( v = 0.6c \) is calculated as \( \gamma = 1.25 \),
        and the work done (relativistic kinetic energy) is \( (\gamma - 1)mc^2 = 0.25mc^2

      answer-explanation: Removing 2 protons from neon-20 (atomic number 10) results
        in atomic number 8 (oxygen). Removing 2 neutrons from neon-20's 10 neutrons
        leaves 8 neutrons. The new isotope is oxygen-16 (8 protons + 8 neutrons =
        mass number 16), which matches the reasoning.
      answer-status: CORRECT
      problem-description-explanation: The problem specifies the original isotope
        (neon-20) and the particles removed (2 protons and 2 neutrons). Neon has atomic
        number 10, and neon-20 has 10 protons and 10 neutrons. Removing 2 protons
        reduces the atomic number to 8 (oxygen), and removing 2 neutrons gives 8 neutrons,

      answer-explanation: As the light source accelerates toward the observer, the
        relativistic Doppler effect causes the observed frequency to increase. The
        conclusion aligns with the formula \( f' = f \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}

      problem-description-explanation: The problem description specifies a blinking
        light source approaching the observer and gaining speed. The Doppler effect

      answer-explanation: In a parallel circuit with an ideal voltage source, adding

      problem-description-explanation: The problem assumes a standard circuit with
        an ideal voltage source (common implicit assumption). Connecting lamps in

        is a standard nuclear process where an alpha particle (mass number 4) is emitted.

      answer-explanation: For gold (heavier than iron), fission should release energy,
        as heavier nuclei release energy when split into lighter nuclei closer to
        iron. The conclusion stating "neither" for gold is incorrect. However, the
        conclusion for carbon (fusion releases energy) is correct. The reasoning for
        gold contradicts the binding energy curve, where fission of heavy nuclei is
        exothermic.
      answer-status: INCORRECT
      problem-description-explanation: The problem description is clear. It asks whether
        fission or fusion releases energy for gold and carbon, which relates to their

      answer-explanation: The conclusion assumes an attractive force (opposite charges),
        but repulsion (same charges) could also cause acceleration. Since the problem
        lacks critical directional information, the answer's validity cannot be determined.
      answer-status: UNCERTAIN
      problem-description-explanation: The problem does not specify whether the particles
        move toward or away from each other. Both like charges (repulsion) and opposite
        charges (attraction) would result in acceleration and increased speed when
        released from rest. The missing directional information makes the problem

        the post-fusion mass is less than the initial mass due to mass-energy conversion,

      answer-explanation: The conclusion about retaining energy and temperature increase

        good absorbers are also good emitters. Without clarifying the energy type

      answer-explanation: The reasoning incorrectly assumes "separated" implies the
        particles are moving apart, concluding they must have like charges. However,
        if "separated" refers only to their initial position, opposite charges would
        also accelerate toward each other, increasing speed. Since both charge types

      answer-status: INCORRECT
      problem-description-explanation: The problem states the particles are "separated,"
        but this term is ambiguous. It could refer to their initial position (being
        apart) or their motion direction (moving apart). If "separated" describes
        their initial state, both like and opposite charges would result in speed

        force by half, matching the halved gravitational force (since gravitational
        force depends on the product of the masses, which becomes \( \frac{m}{2} \times

      answer-explanation: The reasoning concludes both spheres have -0.5e, which correctly
        conserves the total charge (-1e total, split equally). However, the answer
        is incorrect because the problem asks for a "possible combination," and while
        -0.5e for both is valid, other distributions are possible if the spheres are
        not identical. However, since the problem does not specify non-identical spheres,
        the standard assumption of equal splitting applies. The error lies in the
        reasoning's claim that this is the "only possible combination," which is false.
        For example, if one sphere retained more charge due to differing capacitance,
        other splits could occur. But under equal splitting, -0.5e each is correct.
        The answer is incorrect because the reasoning incorrectly asserts uniqueness.
      answer-status: INCORRECT
      problem-description-explanation: The problem description states the initial
        charges (+5e and -6e) and that the spheres briefly come into contact. While
        it does not explicitly state that the spheres are identical (a common assumption
        in such problems), the redistribution of charge via contact inherently depends
        on their being conductors and having equal capacitance (which is standard
        unless specified otherwise). Thus, all necessary information is provided under
        typical physics problem assumptions.

      answer-explanation: The conclusion assumes an isobaric process (constant pressure),
        which is required for \( C^3 \propto T \). However, since the problem does
        not explicitly state that pressure remains constant, the reasoning relies
        on a hidden assumption. Without confirmation of this condition, the validity

      problem-description-explanation: The problem does not specify whether the balloon's
        pressure is constant (e.g., open to atmospheric pressure) during the temperature

        depends on whether the process is isobaric (constant pressure) or not. This

        calculation (using critical value 1.645). The interpretation correctly states
        that 90% of such intervals would contain the true average cost, which aligns
        with the definition of a confidence interval. The minor numerical discrepancies

        and statistical significance of \( r \), it does not directly influence the

        1:
          explanation: The definition of a permutation as a bijection (both injective
            and surjective) from a set to itself is accurate and aligns with standard
            mathematical definitions.

        1:
          explanation: The Pauli exclusion principle and exchange interaction are
            indeed responsible for the energy difference. The exchange interaction
            lowers the energy when spins are parallel (ortho state), which aligns
            with the reasoning.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Ortho states (parallel spins) have a symmetric spin wavefunction,

            is accurate.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Since the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric, a symmetric
            spin wavefunction (ortho) necessitates an antisymmetric spatial wavefunction.
            This causes electrons to occupy regions farther apart, reducing overlap.
            Correct.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: Reduced electron-electron repulsion due to antisymmetric spatial
            wavefunction lowers energy in ortho states. Para states (antisymmetric

          explanation: The definition correctly states that a reversible process is
            idealized, occurs through equilibrium states, and allows the system and
            surroundings to return to their original states. This aligns with standard
            thermodynamic definitions.
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: In a reversible process, the total entropy change (system +
            surroundings) is indeed zero, as entropy production is absent in such
            idealized processes.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: While work done by the system is maximized in reversible processes,
            the claim that heat transfer is "minimized" is incorrect. Heat transfer
            depends on the process, and reversible processes optimize efficiency rather
            than minimize heat.
          node-status: INCORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Work and heat are path-dependent even in reversible processes.

        5:
          explanation: The conclusion follows directly from the correct reasoning

        1:
          explanation: Adding resistors (lamps) in series increases total resistance
            because resistances in series sum directly. This is consistent with the
            formula \( R_{\text{total}} = R_1 + R_2 + \dots \).

          explanation: The step accurately describes the nuclear fission process,
            including the splitting of uranium nuclei into smaller fragments and the
            release of neutrons and energy. While uranium-238 requires fast neutrons
            to fission (unlike uranium-235), the general description of the process
            is correct.
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: The explanation correctly invokes Einstein's mass-energy equivalence

            heat. While "heat" is a result of energy conversion (not a direct form
            of energy release), the distinction between immediate energy forms (kinetic
            energy, gamma rays) and subsequent thermalization is implied here.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: 'This step is accurate: the kinetic energy of the fission fragments
            constitutes the majority (~80-85%) of the total energy released during
            fission, making it the primary form.'
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: The conclusion aligns with the reasoning in previous steps

            issue here.
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: The object starts at rest and accelerates downward due to gravity.
            This is correct initially, as gravity acts downward at the surface.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Gravitational force does not increase as the object approaches
            the center. Only the mass within the object's current radius contributes
            to the force, which decreases. This step incorrectly claims acceleration
            increases.
          node-status: INCORRECT
        3:

          explanation: The step correctly describes the photoelectric effect, emphasizing

          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: The analysis is correct. Since no photoelectrons are observed
            at low intensity, it implies the photon energy (determined by wavelength)
            is below the work function, as intensity does not affect photon energy.
          node-status: CORRECT

          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Correctly distinguishes between intensity (number of photons)
            and photon energy (determined by wavelength). Increasing intensity does
            not alter photon energy, which is wavelength-dependent.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: Valid conclusion. If individual photons lack sufficient energy
            to overcome the work function, increasing their quantity (intensity) will
            not enable electron emission, consistent with photoelectric theory.
          node-status: CORRECT
        5:
          explanation: The final conclusion is correct and consistent with all prior

          explanation: The problem states that exercise is associated with cholesterol
            levels, while gender is not. Identifying exercise as a relevant factor
            and gender as irrelevant aligns with the problem's context.
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: In randomized block design, blocking variables are chosen based
            on their expected influence on the outcome. Since exercise is associated

          explanation: The step correctly identifies the method as systematic sampling.
            However, the problem statement does not mention a random starting point,
            which is part of systematic sampling. Despite this omission, the general
            definition is accurate.
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: The definition of simple random sampling (SRS) provided is
            accurate, emphasizing equal probability for all subsets and individuals,
            which aligns with standard definitions.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Systematic sampling does not allow all subsets to be selected,
            as the fixed interval restricts possible samples. This correctly differentiates
            it from SRS.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: The step appropriately highlights that systematic sampling
            may approximate SRS if the population order is random but introduces bias
            if patterns exist. This is a valid consideration.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: The conclusion logically follows from the previous steps, correctly
            stating that systematic sampling does not meet SRS criteria.

        2:
          explanation: Prioritizing Type II error as more serious in the dialysis
            scenario is correct because patient harm outweighs operational inconvenience.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: While Type II error (defective products) is reasonably deemed
            more serious than Type I (temporary production halt), this depends on
            context. However, the reasoning is valid for emphasizing product quality.

          explanation: The union's objective is indeed to secure higher salaries,
            and presenting data that supports the need for increased compensation
            aligns with negotiation strategies. This step correctly identifies the
            union's goal.
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: The reasoning correctly identifies the salary structure and
            the union's focus on teachers' salaries, as they form the majority. This
            is a valid point, as including administrators' higher salaries could skew
            the data.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: The median is less influenced by outliers (e.g., high administrator
            salaries) and better represents the typical teacher's earnings. This choice
            is logically sound and aligns with statistical reasoning.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: The justification for using the median is accurate. It avoids
            distortion from extreme values (administrators' salaries) and highlights
            the majority's earnings, strengthening the union's argument.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: The conclusion logically follows from the previous steps. Presenting
            the median salary effectively emphasizes the need for raises for most
            teachers, making this step correct.

        1:
          explanation: The assumptions for a 2-sample t-test (independence, normality,
            equal variances) are accurately identified. The note about normality being
            critical for small samples is valid.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: The t-test is indeed suitable for small sample sizes when normality
            holds, which is correctly emphasized here.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:

            is valid.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Increasing the significance level (\(\alpha\)) expands the
            rejection region, making it easier to reject \(H_0\) when it is false,

            terms.
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: The range is calculated as the difference between the maximum
            and minimum values. Increasing the maximum by 2 inches directly increases
            the range by 2, so this reasoning is correct.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: The IQR depends on Q3 and Q1, which are based on the middle
            50% of data. Changing the maximum value (an extreme value) does not affect
            these quartiles, so the IQR remains unchanged. This is accurate.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Standard deviation is sensitive to changes in extreme values.
            Increasing the maximum height increases its deviation from the mean, thus
            changing the standard deviation. The reasoning is correct.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: Variance is the square of the standard deviation. Since the
            standard deviation changes, variance must also change. This is valid.
          node-status: CORRECT
        5:
          explanation: MAD depends on absolute deviations from the mean. Changing

        1:
          explanation: The step correctly explains that a 95% confidence interval
            for the slope means we are 95% confident the true slope lies within (0.45,
            0.80). This is a valid interpretation of confidence intervals.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: The interval (0.45, 0.80) indeed excludes 0, which means the
            true slope is unlikely to be zero. A zero slope would indicate no linear
            relationship, so this reasoning is accurate.
          node-status: CORRECT

          explanation: The first study is correctly identified as experimental. The
            key characteristic of an experimental study is the manipulation of the
            independent variable (TV watching time) by the researchers, which is explicitly
            described here.
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: The second study is correctly classified as observational.
            Observational studies involve measuring variables without manipulation,
            and the use of a questionnaire to gather data on existing behaviors (TV
            usage and grades) fits this definition.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: The comparison of strengths and weaknesses is accurate. Experimental
            studies can infer causation but may lack external validity, while observational
            studies capture real-world behaviors but cannot establish causation due
            to confounding variables.

        0:
          explanation: The step correctly introduces using a hypothesis test for a
            proportion, which is appropriate for comparing observed success rate to
            a hypothesized probability.
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: The null and alternative hypotheses are correctly defined for
            a one-tailed test, aligning with the problem's requirement to test if
            performance is better than guessing.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: The significance level is set to 5% as specified in the problem,
            which is standard for such hypothesis tests.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Modeling as a binomial distribution is valid due to independent
            trials with replacement and fixed probability, satisfying binomial assumptions.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: "Normal approximation is justified here because np = 50 and\
            \ n(1-p) = 50 are both \u22655, meeting the criteria for normal approximation."
          node-status: CORRECT
        5:
          explanation: "The critical z-score for a one-tailed test at \u03B1=0.05\
            \ is correctly identified as 1.645 from standard normal tables."
          node-status: CORRECT
        6:
          explanation: The calculation using the z-score formula is accurate, resulting
            in k=58.225 before rounding.
          node-status: CORRECT
        7:
          explanation: Rounding up to 59 ensures the critical value is an integer
            and maintains the significance level, as discrete outcomes require this
            adjustment.
          node-status: CORRECT
        8:
          explanation: The conclusion correctly states 59 as the minimum number of
            correct guesses, consistent with all prior correct steps.

          explanation: The step correctly identifies the 67% as the point estimate,
            which is the statistic derived from the survey sample.
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: The margin of error indeed defines the range around the point
            estimate where the true population parameter is likely to lie.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: The calculation for the lower (64%) and upper (70%) bounds
            is mathematically accurate.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: The interpretation of the range accounting for sampling variability
            aligns with the purpose of a margin of error.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: While the problem does not explicitly mention a confidence
            level, it is standard to associate a margin of error with a 95% confidence
            level in most surveys unless stated otherwise. The explanation is consistent
            with this convention.

        doesn't affect subsequent steps (5-6) which correctly use subgroup properties

          explanation: The step in question applies the Intermediate Value Theorem
            (IVT) to function \( g(x) = f(x) - x \) on the open interval \( (0, 1)
            \), assuming evaluations at \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 1 \). However, the
            IVT requires continuity on a closed interval \([a, b]\), and \( f \) is
            defined on \( (0, 1) \), excluding the endpoints. This makes the IVT application
            invalid because \( g(0) \) and \( g(1) \) are not defined in the domain.
            While the reasoning in this step is flawed, the subsequent step provides
            a valid counterexample (\( f(x) = x/2 \)) to conclude Statement 2 is false.
            The error in step 7 is not explicitly corrected but is overridden by the
            counterexample. Since the final conclusion does not rely on the flawed
            IVT argument, the step is unfaithful due to the mathematical error, but
            the severity is mitigated by the later correction.

          explanation: The step concludes that the moon's mass cannot be calculated
            because orbital dynamics depend on the planet's mass, not the moon's.
            While the reasoning mentions calculating angular momentum \( L = m \cdot
            v_{\text{max}} \cdot r_{\text{min}} \), which explicitly includes the
            moon's mass \( m \), this appears contradictory. However, in standard
            orbital mechanics (assuming the moon's mass is negligible compared to
            the planet's), the moon's mass \( m \) cancels out in equations like Kepler's
            third law and does not affect orbital parameters. Thus, even though \(
            L \) technically depends on \( m \), the moon's mass cannot be determined
            from the given data because it is not required for any other derived quantities
            (e.g., semi-major axis, eccentricity, period). The conclusion aligns with
            the physics of two-body systems where the satellite's mass is irrelevant.
            The mention of \( L \) might seem misleading, but the core reasoning about
            the moon's mass being indeterminable is correct.

          explanation: The step claims that gravitational force and acceleration increase
            as the object approaches the Earth's center. However, under the ideal
            conditions described (uniform density), gravitational acceleration inside
            the Earth actually decreases linearly with distance from the center, reaching
            zero at the center. This is a key conceptual error in the reasoning. While
            the subsequent steps correctly describe the motion (e.g., maximum speed
            at the center, oscillation), they implicitly ignore the incorrect premise
            in step 2. The mistake in step 2 is not addressed later, making the reasoning
            internally inconsistent. However, the final answer (simple harmonic motion)
            remains correct because the later steps align with the correct physics
            despite the error in step 2. The error in step 2 is significant but does
            not propagate to invalidate the conclusion.

          explanation: "The step labels the sampling method as \"convenience sampling,\"\
            \ but the described method (random page, finger placement, then next 75\
            \ names) more closely resembles systematic sampling with a random start.\
            \ However, the core reasoning\u2014that the method is non-random and introduces\
            \ bias\u2014is accurate. While the specific terminology (\"convenience\"\
            ) is arguably incorrect, the conclusion about bias and non-representativeness\
            \ remains valid. The misclassification does not affect the final answer's\
            \ correctness, as the critical issue is the lack of true randomness, which\
            \ is correctly identified. The guidelines advise leniency for verbal/label\
            \ mismatches if the underlying logic holds, which it does here."
