      answer-explanation: The ambiguity in |aH|'s meaning impacts the evaluation.
        If |aH| refers to the element's order in the factor group, Statement 1 is
        true (as |aH| divides |a|), making the step's conclusion incorrect. If |aH|
        refers to the coset size, the step's analysis of Statement 1 is correct. Statement
        2's analysis is correct, but the overall ambiguity renders the answer uncertain.
      answer-status: UNCERTAIN
      problem-description-explanation: The problem is ambiguous because the notation
        |aH| in Statement 1 is not clearly defined. It could refer to the order of
        the element aH in the factor group (which would relate to |a|) or the size
        of the coset aH (which equals |H|). This ambiguity affects the validity of

        gH=Hg (conjugate elements remain in H) but does not require elements of H

      answer-explanation: The conclusion that S is dense in the unit square is correct.
        The set of points with both coordinates rational is countable and thus has
        closure smaller than the unit square. Since irrationals are dense in [0,1],
        S (requiring at least one irrational coordinate) is dense in the unit square.
        The reasoning about density and measure zero complement aligns with topological
        properties of density.
      answer-status: CORRECT
      problem-description-explanation: The problem description clearly defines the
        subset S as all points (x, y) in the unit square where at least one coordinate

      answer-explanation: The reasoning is correct. Parallel electron spins (ortho-
        state) produce a symmetric spin wavefunction, requiring an antisymmetric spatial
        wavefunction. This antisymmetry reduces the probability of electrons being
        close to each other, lowering the Coulomb repulsion energy. The exchange interaction
        accounts for this energy difference, making the ortho- state lower in energy
        than the para- state. The explanation aligns with quantum mechanical principles

        familiar with nuclear fission concepts. It implicitly relies on the standard
        understanding of mass-energy equivalence (E=mc2) in fission processes, where
        the total mass of the products is less than the original due to energy release.
        While it does not explicitly mention binding energy or mass defect, these
        are foundational elements in nuclear physics problems of this type.

      problem-description-explanation: "The problem description specifies the condition\

      answer-explanation: Gravitational acceleration scales inversely with the square
        of the radius. Reducing the radius to 1/10th (from diameter reduction) increases
        acceleration by (10)2 = 100. Thus, weight (proportional to gravitational force)

      problem-description-explanation: The problem specifies the planet shrinks to

      answer-explanation: In nuclear fission, the majority of the energy released
        is indeed the kinetic energy of the fission fragments, as they repel each
        other due to Coulomb forces. Other forms (e.g., gamma rays, neutrons' kinetic

        must balance the vertical weight (\(mg\)) via its vertical component and provide

      answer-explanation: The normal force on an object on an inclined plane is indeed
        \(N = mg \cos(\theta)\), derived from resolving gravitational force into components.
        Rolling motion does not alter the perpendicular equilibrium, so the conclusion
        is correct even for a rolling ball. The reasoning aligns with standard physics

      answer-status: CORRECT
      problem-description-explanation: The problem description specifies a ball rolling
        down an inclined plane and asks for the normal force. The normal force formula
        \(N = mg \cos(\theta)\) depends only on mass, gravity, and the angle of the

        it impossible to validate the conclusion. The mention of X-rays is context-dependent
        (e.g., temperatures of millions of Kelvin), which is not specified. The missing
        comparison basis ("relatively" to what?) further undermines the conclusion.
      answer-status: UNCERTAIN
      problem-description-explanation: The problem statement is incomplete. It ends
        abruptly with "radiates relatively" without specifying what the comparison
        is relative to (e.g., a low-temperature source) or defining the physical quantity
        being discussed (e.g., wavelength distribution). Key concepts like Wien's
        displacement law or blackbody radiation are implied but not explicitly stated,
        leaving the context undefined.

      answer-explanation: The reasoning provides an accurate general explanation of
        the correspondence principle, but since there is no specific problem defined
        (e.g., calculations, quantitative relationships), the final "answer" is simply
        a restatement of the principle itself rather than a solution to a concrete
        problem. While the statement "Classical physics emerges... at large quantum
        numbers" is correct in isolation, its relevance to an undefined problem cannot
        be evaluated conclusively.
      answer-status: UNCERTAIN
      problem-description-explanation: The problem description only mentions "According
        to the correspondence principle," but does not specify any actual problem
        to solve (e.g., a numerical scenario, comparative analysis, or mathematical
        relationship). There is no explicit question, equation, or measurable outcome

      answer-status: UNCERTAIN
      problem-description-explanation: "The problem does not specify whether the context\

      answer-explanation: The step incorrectly narrows the answer to ultrasound, claiming
        infrasound is "less common." While ultrasound is above 20,000 Hz, infrasound
        (below 20 Hz) is equally inaudible to humans. The exclusion of infrasound
        is unjustified, as the problem does not mention commonality or physical perception.
        The correct answer should include both infrasound and ultrasound.
      answer-status: INCORRECT
      problem-description-explanation: The problem asks for "sound waves that most
        humans cannot hear," which could refer to both infrasound (below 20 Hz) and
        ultrasound (above 20,000 Hz). However, the phrasing "are" (plural) vs. the

      answer-status: UNCERTAIN
      problem-description-explanation: The problem statement "A machine cannot multiply"
        is highly ambiguous. It could refer to mathematical multiplication (arithmetic
        operation), physical replication (self-reproduction), or metaphorical interpretations

      answer-explanation: When the puck is at x = 1.0 m, it is moving to the right
        (from 0.2 m to 1.2 m) but slowing down. By Newton's second law, the net force
        must be opposite to the direction of motion (left) to cause deceleration.
        The reasoning correctly identifies the force direction as opposite to the
        velocity.
      answer-status: CORRECT
      problem-description-explanation: The problem description implies the puck decelerates
        after being released (as it comes to rest), which necessitates a net force
        opposing its motion. While friction is not explicitly mentioned, the scenario

        only on the source charges (plate charge density and configuration), not the

      answer-explanation: The reasoning incorrectly concludes that Statement III is
        true. With air resistance, the time to ascend is actually **shorter** than
        the time to descend. During ascent, air resistance and gravity both oppose
        the motion, causing greater deceleration and a faster stop. During descent,
        air resistance opposes gravity, reducing net acceleration and prolonging the
        fall. Thus, Statement III is false. The correct answer should only include
        Statement I.

      answer-explanation: The last step in the reasoning is correct. It acknowledges
        that traditionally, for a stationary launch, the optimal angle for maximum
        range is around 45 degrees. However, it correctly adjusts this understanding
        for the scenario where the cannon is mounted on a moving truck, suggesting
        that the optimal angle will be less than 45 degrees due to the additional
        forward velocity provided by the truck. This adjustment is based on the principle
        that increased horizontal velocity (in this case, from the truck's motion)
        extends the range, thus requiring a slightly reduced angle of elevation to
        achieve the maximum range. The explanation does not provide a numerical solution
        but offers a sound theoretical basis for understanding how the optimal launch
        angle is determined, recognizing the need for further mathematical steps (such
        as calculus or numerical analysis) to find the exact angle.

        a randomized block design and identifies exercise (a factor associated with
        cholesterol levels) as the relevant blocking variable. While it does not detail
        how exercise levels are categorized (e.g., low/moderate/high), the core requirement
        for selecting the blocking factor (exercise) is explicitly stated, making
        the problem solvable without further assumptions.

      answer-explanation: The answer assumes exercise intensity data is available
        for analysis via ANCOVA. However, the problem does not explicitly state that
        exercise intensity will be measured in the experiment, which is a critical
        prerequisite for the proposed analysis. Thus, the validity of the step depends
        on unstated assumptions.
      answer-status: UNCERTAIN
      problem-description-explanation: The problem description does not specify whether
        exercise intensity will be measured in the experiment. While past studies
        note its association with cholesterol, the current experiment must explicitly
        collect exercise intensity data to control for it. Without this information,
        the design is incomplete, as the proposed statistical control (ANCOVA) requires
        these measurements.

      answer-explanation: The mean is calculated as total sum divided by the number
        of scores (10). Increasing one score by 40 increases the total sum by 40,

        sample biased toward individuals with listed phone numbers, which undermines
        its representativeness. The telephone book method excludes portions of the
        population (e.g., unlisted numbers, cellphone users), leading to potential
        bias in long-distance carrier usage results. The conclusion aligns with standard
        sampling bias critiques.

        1:
          explanation: The analysis for Option I correctly verifies closure under

            be closed under addition, as the sum of two products is not necessarily
            a product of elements from U and V. While the closure under multiplication
            is partially addressed, the conclusion that Option II is not necessarily
            an ideal is valid due to the failure of closure under addition.

        3:
          explanation: The analysis correctly uses the fact that idempotent matrices
            have eigenvalues 0 and 1 and are diagonalizable due to their minimal polynomial
            splitting into distinct linear factors. This is a standard result.

          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: The formula used here is incorrect. The first Doppler shift
            should account for the source (siren) moving toward the wall, not the

        1:
          explanation: Satellites are indeed in continuous free fall, where gravity
            acts as the centripetal force, and their tangential velocity prevents
            them from colliding with Earth. This is a fundamental concept in orbital
            mechanics.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: The phrasing "balancing gravity and velocity" is misleading.
            Gravity is the force providing centripetal acceleration, and velocity
            determines the orbital path. The term "balance" inaccurately implies opposing
            forces rather than a relationship between velocity and gravitational acceleration.
          node-status: INCORRECT
        3:

          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: While satellites maintain altitude due to their velocity, the
            claim that they are "unaffected by Earth's atmosphere" is incorrect for
            low Earth orbit satellites, which experience atmospheric drag. The statement
            is overly generalized.
          node-status: INCORRECT
        5:

          explanation: The statement incorrectly claims that the force applied equals
            the force on the load in an ideal pulley system. This is only true if
            the mechanical advantage (MA) is 1. However, the MA here is 4, so the
            force applied is less than the load. The error here invalidates the initial
            reasoning about force equality.
          node-status: INCORRECT
        2:
          explanation: This step correctly identifies the need to consider mechanical
            advantage to relate force and distance, which is essential for solving
            the problem.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: The reasoning correctly identifies that the mechanical advantage
            must be greater than 1 because the applied force (25 N) is less than the
            load (100 N). This aligns with the definition of MA.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: The calculation of mechanical advantage as MA = 100 N / 25
            N = 4 is accurate and follows directly from the problem's values.
          node-status: CORRECT
        5:
          explanation: This step correctly states that MA relates the distance the
            effort moves to the distance the load moves. Specifically, the distance
            the load moves is the effort distance divided by MA, which is consistent
            with pulley system mechanics.

        1:
          explanation: Front-end estimation uses the first digit without rounding

          explanation: Adjustment calculations are based on incorrect rounding (using
            0.9 instead of front-end 0.8 for 0.892). The reasoning misapplies the
            adjustment logic.
          node-status: INCORRECT
        5:
          explanation: While the conclusion about the estimate being slightly low

          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Step 2 accurately recalls the formula for the product of divisors
            as n^(d/2), where d is the number of divisors. This is a valid formula.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Step 3 correctly applies the condition n^(d/2) = n^6 to derive
            d = 12. The algebra here is correct.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: Step 4 incorrectly identifies the prime factorization forms
            for 12 divisors. The correct forms are p^11, p^5 q, p^3 q^2, or p^2 q
            r. The user lists p^3 q (which gives 8 divisors) and p q r (which gives
            8 divisors), both of which are wrong.
          node-status: INCORRECT
        5:
          explanation: Step 5 is based on the incorrect forms from Step 4. The candidates
            24 (p^3 q) and 30 (p q r) have only 8 divisors each, not 12. The correct
            smallest candidates would be 60 (p^2 q r) or 72 (p^3 q^2).
          node-status: INCORRECT
        6:
          explanation: Step 6 incorrectly verifies n=24 and n=30. For n=24, the product
            of divisors is 24^4, not 24^6. Similarly, n=30's product is 30^4. The
            user's calculations are flawed.
          node-status: INCORRECT
        7:
          explanation: Step 7 concludes n=24 is correct, but this is based on earlier
            errors. The actual product of divisors for n=24 does not equal n^6, so
            the conclusion is invalid.

        3:

        1:
          explanation: The degree of a composition of two polynomials is the product
            of their degrees. Since f is degree 6 and g is degree 3, f(g(x)) has degree
            6*3=18. Correct.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Similarly, g(h(x))'s degree is 3*d where d is h's degree. This
            is correct as composition multiplies degrees.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: h(f(x))'s degree is d*6, which is correct for the same reasoning.
          node-status: CORRECT

        5:
          explanation: Setting 3d=36 or 6d=36 is valid to find possible d values.
            However, the reasoning neglects that d=12 would lead to h(f(x)) being
            72, which contradicts the total degree of 36. But the initial setup is
            correct.
          node-status: CORRECT
        6:
          explanation: While solving 3d=36 and 6d=36 is correct, the step incorrectly
            dismisses d=12. If d=12, h(f(x)) would be 72, exceeding 36. Thus, d=12
            is invalid, making this step incorrect.
          node-status: INCORRECT
        7:
          explanation: Despite the error in step 6, the conclusion d=6 is correct

            \ proportion confidence interval."
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Increasing the confidence level does lead to a higher Z-score,
            as a wider interval is needed to capture more of the population proportion.
            This relationship is correctly explained.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: The Z-scores for 90% (1.645) and 99% (2.576) confidence levels

        5:
          explanation: 'Defining p1 and p2 as "pro-choice" proportions and writing
            H0: p1 = p2 is statistically valid. The choice of "pro-choice" is arbitrary

            correcting the tallest student's height.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: The step identifies common measures of spread (range, variance,
            standard deviation) and later includes IQR, which are all relevant to
            the problem.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Increasing the maximum value (tallest student's height) increases
            the range, as the minimum remains unchanged. This analysis is correct.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: Changing the tallest person's height affects the mean, which
            alters deviations from the mean for all data points, thereby changing
            variance and standard deviation. This reasoning is accurate.
          node-status: CORRECT
        5:
          explanation: IQR depends on Q3 and Q1, which are position-based. Adjusting
            an outlier (tallest student) does not affect quartiles if their position
            relative to the quartiles remains unchanged. This reasoning is correct.

            with the problem statement.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: The experimental design is accurately described as a within-subjects/repeated

            (with/without additive).
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: A paired comparison is appropriate here because the same engine
            types are tested under both conditions, requiring an analysis that accounts
            for paired data.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: The paired t-test (dependent samples t-test) is the correct
            choice for comparing means of paired observations, assuming normality
            and other assumptions are met.
          node-status: CORRECT
        5:
          explanation: Additional analyses like descriptive statistics and non-parametric
            tests (if assumptions fail) are reasonable. ANOVA/regression might be
            less relevant unless examining interactions with engine types, but the
            suggestions are still valid.

          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: The sample being self-selected is accurate. Only individuals

          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: The connection between being reachable and having fewer children
            is not definitively proven, but the reasoning is plausible (e.g., retirees/empty
            nesters being home more often). However, stay-at-home parents might have

          explanation: A positive correlation of 0.30 correctly indicates that as
            self-efficacy increases, job satisfaction tends to increase. This is a
            valid interpretation of the correlation coefficient.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: While 0.30 is a moderate correlation, the problem does not
            provide information about statistical significance (e.g., p-value or sample
            size), so claiming it is "statistically significant" is an assumption
            and not supported by the given data.
          node-status: INCORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Squaring the correlation coefficient (0.302 = 0.09) to calculate
            the coefficient of determination (9% variance explained) is a correct
            application of statistical interpretation.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:

        5:
          explanation: The final conclusion ("Teachers who believe they have more
            control...") correctly restates the correlation. However, the reasoning
            about interventions implying causation (e.g., "may lead to increased job
            satisfaction") oversteps the correlational data, as causation cannot be
            inferred from correlation alone.

            is appropriate.
          node-status: CORRECT
        1:
          explanation: The confidence interval (0.45, 0.80) does not include zero,
            which statistically indicates that the slope is significantly different
            from zero at the 95% level. This supports the existence of a linear relationship,
            making this reasoning correct.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Statement I is correctly assessed as true. The exclusion of
            zero in the 95% confidence interval for the slope provides sufficient
            evidence to reject the null hypothesis of no linear relationship, aligning
            with standard statistical interpretation.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: A non-zero slope (as indicated by the confidence interval)
            directly implies a non-zero correlation (r), since correlation and regression
            slope are mathematically linked. Statement II is properly affirmed as
            true.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: Statement III is false because the confidence interval (0.45,
            0.80) does not contain zero, making it highly unlikely that the true slope
            is zero. The reasoning here is accurate.
          node-status: CORRECT
        5:
          explanation: The conclusion that Statements I and II are true while III
            is false follows logically from the analysis in previous steps, all of

            statistical concepts, including the range and interpretation of the correlation
            coefficient.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: 'Correctly applies the correlation definition: no variation
            in one variable means no linear relationship can exist, leading to zero
            correlation.'

        5:
          explanation: The conclusion that the correlation coefficient is zero is
            valid because one variable has no variation, making covariance and thus
            correlation undefined (effectively zero).

          explanation: The method described is stratified sampling (dividing into
            groups by letter and sampling each), not systematic sampling. Systematic
            sampling involves regular intervals.
          node-status: INCORRECT

        4:
          explanation: The bias would actually be toward overrepresenting customers

            of the total per letter. The reasoning here is inverted.
          node-status: INCORRECT
        5:
          explanation: Random selection within strata improves internal validity but

          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Plan I's inclusion of non-investors (with $0 investments) would
            dilute the average, leading to underestimation. This reasoning is statistically
            sound.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Plan II correctly targets the relevant subpopulation (investors),
            improving accuracy. This is valid, as sampling from the known investors
            reduces irrelevant data.
          node-status: CORRECT

            to illustrate this concept.'
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:
          explanation: The step correctly addresses the common misconception that
            the interval has a 95% probability of containing the true mean. It clarifies
            that the confidence level refers to the method's long-run performance,

          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: Step 2 correctly defines a simple random sample (SRS) as requiring
            every possible subset of the population of the same size to have an equal
            chance of selection. This aligns with the standard definition of SRS.
          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Step 3 correctly observes that the method does not involve
            a single random draw from the entire population of 1000, which is a key
            distinction from SRS.
          node-status: CORRECT
        4:

        5:
          explanation: 'Step 5 is correct: within each plant, the selection of six
            employees is a simple random sample, ensuring equal probability for subsets
            within the subgroup.'
          node-status: CORRECT
        6:
          explanation: 'Step 6 correctly identifies the critical flaw: the method
            restricts the sample to exactly six employees per plant, making many subsets
            (e.g., 7 from one plant) impossible. Thus, not all subsets of 30 have
            equal chance.'

            target population.
          node-status: CORRECT
        2:
          explanation: The sampling method is not a true simple random sample of the

          node-status: CORRECT
        3:
          explanation: Adults at a Wall Street office building are likely overrepresented
            in finance-related professions, making the sample unrepresentative of

          explanation: The explanation correctly introduces confidence intervals and
            their purpose. However, the statement about the confidence level's probability
            is a common simplification. While technically a confidence level refers
            to the long-run frequency of intervals containing the parameter, the simplified
            explanation is acceptable here.

        2:
          explanation: The reasoning correctly identifies that higher confidence levels
            result in wider intervals. This is due to the increased critical value

          explanation: The method described is convenience sampling because the researcher
            uses an easily accessible source (telephone book) and selects the next
            75 names without randomization beyond the initial page. While systematic
            sampling could be a consideration, the reliance on the phone book as the

      reasoning: The initial step-3 incorrectly describes a tree with two vertices
        of degree 2 connected to each other and two leaves, which is actually the
        path graph (correct structure but misrepresented). However, the reasoning
        later corrects this in step 6 by properly identifying the path graph and the
        third valid tree (with a degree 3 vertex). The error in step-3 was part of
        the initial overcount but was self-corrected, leading to the right answer.

      reasoning: "Step 8's example is flawed (f isn't continuous at x=1/2 in X), but\
        \ the conclusion in step 9 remains correct due to existence of valid counterexamples\
        \ (e.g., X=[0,1], Y=R, f(x)=x which maps to [0,1], but this isn't unbounded.\
        \ Wait, no. A correct example would be X as a closed bounded space in a different\
        \ metric. For instance, take X as [0,1] with discrete metric (which is closed\
        \ and bounded), Y=R with standard metric, and f(x)=x. Then X is closed and\
        \ bounded, but f(X)=[0,1] which is closed and bounded. Hmm. Alternatively,\
        \ consider X as the same space but Y with a different metric. Maybe a better\
        \ example is X = [0,1] in R, Y = R2, and f(x) = (x, tan(\u03C0(x - 1/2))).\
        \ But that's more complex. Alternatively, use a function that maps to an unbounded\
        \ set but remains continuous. For example, take X = N with the discrete metric\
        \ (which is closed and bounded because all points are isolated and any set\
        \ is closed), and Y = R. Define f(n) = n. Then X is closed and bounded (since\
        \ every point is an open ball of radius 1/2), but f(X) = N which is not bounded.\
        \ This works. So the original example in step 8 is wrong, but there exists\
        \ a correct example. Therefore, the error in step 8 is major because the example\
        \ is incorrect, but the conclusion is still correct. Since the conclusion\
        \ in step 9 doesn't depend on the flawed example (as other examples exist),\
        \ the error in step 8 is major but doesn't propagate to make the final conclusion\
        \ wrong. Thus, step 8 is incorrect with major severity."

      reasoning: Step 2 incorrectly attributes the energy difference to Hund's rule,
        which applies to electrons in different orbitals (maximizing spin multiplicity),
        not the same orbital. However, step 3 correctly introduces the Pauli exclusion
        principle, which is the actual key factor. The error in step 2 is later corrected,
        but the initial misapplication of Hund's rule could mislead if not for the
        subsequent correction.

          explanation: Step 4 incorrectly states the source frequency remains constant
            from the observer's perspective. This contradicts Doppler effect principles
            where relative motion alters perceived frequency. However, step 5 implicitly
            corrects this by introducing the Doppler effect explanation.

            probability for earlier students. However, this error doesn't propagate
            as later steps correctly focus on non-random arrival order.

          explanation: Step 6 claims that the initial calculation overcounts and needs
            division by 10! and (2!)^10. However, the product in step 5 already inherently
            accounts for (2!)^10 through the combinations (C(n,2) terms). The division
            by 10! would only be correct if professors were indistinct, but the problem
            specifies distinct professors. While step 6 incorrectly introduces division
            by 10!, this error is later corrected in step 9 by explicitly rejecting
            the division by 10!. Thus, step 6 contains a major mathematical error
            (unnecessary division by 10!) that would have led to an incorrect answer
            if not corrected later. However, since the correction happens in step
            9, the final answer remains valid, but the reasoning in step 6 is internally
            inconsistent and unfaithful.

          explanation: Step 10 contains multiple contradictions and errors. It first
            incorrectly claims the valid area is found by subtracting two 12.5-area
            triangles from 25 (which would produce 0 area), then dismisses this approach
            as "incorrectly described." Later in Step 11, it claims the valid area
            is 1/4 of 25 (6.25) without proper justification. The actual valid region
            (x+y >5 with x,y <5) forms a triangle with area 12.5 (1/2 of 25), which
            would lead to 1/2 probability if followed consistently. However, the chain
            overrides this with an unjustified 1/4 claim that matches the known correct
            answer but conflicts with its own geometric reasoning. The mathematical
            error in Step 10 (incorrect area subtraction) would have led to 0 probability
            if not corrected, but the subsequent override in Step 11 introduces a
            new error (claiming 1/4 area without valid derivation). This creates internal
            inconsistency and misrepresents the true geometric relationship.

            This is correct: KE per unit mass is proportional to velocity squared,

          explanation: 'The step in question (Step 4) contains two key errors in analyzing
            the function''s behavior:

            1. **Direction of limits at x=1**: The reasoning incorrectly states that
            as \(x \to 1^-\), \(f(x) \to -\infty\), and as \(x \to 1^+\), \(f(x) \to
            +\infty\). In reality, the opposite is true: approaching 1 from the left
            (values <1) makes \(1-x\) positive and small, so \(f(x) \to +\infty\),
            while approaching from the right (values >1) makes \(1-x\) negative and
            small, so \(f(x) \to -\infty\).

            2. **Behavior at \(x \to +\infty\)**: The reasoning claims \(f(x) \to
            0\) "from above," but \(1-x\) becomes large negative as \(x \to +\infty\),
            so \(f(x) \to 0\) from below (negative side).


            However, these errors **do not affect the final answer** in Step 5. The
            conclusion that the range excludes 0 is correct because:

            - The function still covers all positive values (from \(x < 1\)) and all
            negative values (from \(x > 1\)), regardless of the misattributed direction
            of the asymptotes.

            - The horizontal asymptote at \(y=0\) is never reached, which is correctly
            identified.

            (exponents must be odd) that is later ignored in step 6, where the analysis

          explanation: Step 6 contains a mathematical error in its reasoning. When
            using 12 computers with 2 students each (24 students), there are 2 remaining
            students and 6 leftover computers. The 2 students would occupy 2 computers
            (1 each), leaving 4 computers unused. However, the step incorrectly claims
            these 4 computers can be used by "4 additional students," which is impossible
            since all 26 students are already accounted for (24 + 2 = 26). This introduces
            a false conclusion that 6 students (2 + 4) could have computers to themselves
            in this scenario, when the correct number is 2. While the error is later
            implicitly corrected in subsequent steps (which abandon this line of reasoning),
            the mistake in step 6 itself would have led to an incorrect intermediate

            \ the impulse (\u0394p) is equal and opposite for both objects (as established\
            \ in step 1). Since \u0394p = m\u0394v, the lighter car (smaller m) must\
            \ have a larger \u0394v to achieve the same \u0394p as the truck. The\
            \ reasoning here aligns with physics principles and does not introduce\
            \ a mathematical error. While step 4 later confuses the relationship between\
            \ \u0394p and \u0394v, step 3 itself is accurate and logically consistent.\
            \ The key point is that \u0394p is equal for both objects, and the car's\
            \ greater \u0394v compensates for its smaller mass. There is no internal\
            \ contradiction or mistake in step 3 that would propagate to later steps."

          explanation: The step states that the confidence interval represents the
            difference (Subaru - Toyota), leading to the conclusion that Subaru's
            satisfaction proportion is higher. However, the problem's confidence interval
            is for the difference between Toyota and Subaru (Toyota - Subaru). If
            the interval were truly (Subaru - Toyota), a negative interval would imply
            Subaru's proportion is *lower*, contradicting the conclusion. The mistake
            in labeling the direction of the difference introduces a critical inconsistency.
            However, the conclusion itself (Subaru higher) aligns with the correct
            interpretation (Toyota - Subaru being negative), so the error in reasoning
            does not propagate to the final answer. Despite this, the reasoning step
            contains a major logical flaw that misrepresents the interval's direction,
            which could mislead if followed strictly.

          explanation: "The step-1 incorrectly identifies the sampling method as cluster\
            \ sampling when it should be stratified sampling. Cluster sampling involves\
            \ selecting entire clusters (e.g., districts) and sampling all units within\
            \ them, whereas stratified sampling involves dividing the population into\
            \ strata (districts here) and sampling from each stratum. However, the\
            \ subsequent reasoning (steps 2-5) focuses on district-level representation\
            \ and potential limitations in statewide representativeness, which are\
            \ valid points regardless of the method\u2019s name. The misclassification\
            \ in terminology does not propagate into later steps or affect the final\
            \ conclusion about district representation. The guidelines advise leniency\
            \ for label mismatches if the core logic remains intact, and the error\
            \ here is primarily verbal rather than mathematical or logical."
