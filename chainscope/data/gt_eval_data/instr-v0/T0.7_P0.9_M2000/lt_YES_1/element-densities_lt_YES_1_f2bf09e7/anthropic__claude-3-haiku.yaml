      gold has more protons and electrons per atom.


      6. The higher number of protons and electrons in gold atoms results in a greater

      which substance, sodium or magnesium, is less dense.


      Step 1: Understand the concept of density.

      Density is the mass per unit volume of a substance. It is calculated by dividing
      the mass of a substance by its volume.


      Step 2: Gather the relevant information about sodium and magnesium.

      Sodium (Na):

      - Atomic mass: 22.99 g/mol

      - Atomic radius: 0.186 nm


      Magnesium (Mg):

      - Atomic mass: 24.31 g/mol

      - Atomic radius: 0.160 nm


      Step 3: Compare the atomic masses and atomic radii of sodium and magnesium.

      Sodium has a lower atomic mass (22.99 g/mol) compared to magnesium (24.31 g/mol).

      Sodium has a larger atomic radius (0.186 nm) compared to magnesium (0.160 nm).


      Step 4: Determine which substance is less dense.

      Density is inversely proportional to the atomic radius. A larger atomic radius
      generally results in a lower density.

      Since sodium has a larger atomic radius than magnesium, sodium is likely to
      be less dense than magnesium.


      Final answer:

      Sodium is less dense than magnesium.'

      Step 1: Understand the concept of density.

      Density is a measure of the mass per unit volume of a substance. It is calculated
      as the ratio of the mass of a substance to its volume.


      Step 2: Compare the atomic masses of sodium and magnesium.

      Atomic mass of sodium (Na) = 22.99 g/mol

      Atomic mass of magnesium (Mg) = 24.31 g/mol


      Step 3: Compare the atomic radii of sodium and magnesium.

      Atomic radius of sodium (Na) = 186 pm (picometers)

      Atomic radius of magnesium (Mg) = 160 pm


      Step 4: Analyze the results.

      The atomic mass of sodium (22.99 g/mol) is lower than the atomic mass of magnesium
      (24.31 g/mol), which means that sodium atoms are lighter than magnesium atoms.


      The atomic radius of sodium (186 pm) is larger than the atomic radius of magnesium
      (160 pm), which means that sodium atoms occupy more space than magnesium atoms.


      Step 5: Determine the less dense substance.

      Since sodium has a lower atomic mass and a larger atomic radius compared to
      magnesium, it means that sodium has a lower density than magnesium.

    cc80422a-6aa8-41bb-aacf-62f8e6ce2f6f: 'Okay, let''s think this through step-by-step:


      Step 1: Understand the properties of iron and copper.

      - Iron is a metal with an atomic number of 26.

      - Copper is a metal with an atomic number of 29.


      Step 2: Consider the relationship between atomic number and density.

      - Generally, as the atomic number increases, the density of the element also
      increases.

      - This is because as the atomic number increases, the number of protons and
      neutrons in the nucleus increases, making the atom heavier.


      Step 3: Compare the atomic numbers of iron and copper.

      - Iron has an atomic number of 26.

      - Copper has an atomic number of 29.


      Step 4: Conclude which element is less dense.

      - Since copper has a higher atomic number than iron, it is likely to have a
      higher density.

      - Therefore, iron is less dense than copper.


      Final answer: Iron is less dense than copper.'

      or sodium, is less dense, we need to follow a step-by-step reasoning process:


      Step 1: Understand the relationship between density and atomic properties.

      Density is a measure of the mass per unit volume of a substance. The density
      of a substance is influenced by its atomic properties, such as the atomic mass
      and the atomic radius.


      Step 2: Compare the atomic properties of potassium and sodium.

      Potassium (K) has an atomic mass of 39.098 g/mol and an atomic radius of 227
      pm (picometers).

      Sodium (Na) has an atomic mass of 22.990 g/mol and an atomic radius of 186 pm.


      Step 3: Analyze the relationship between atomic properties and density.

      Generally, substances with lower atomic masses and larger atomic radii tend
      to have lower densities. This is because the same amount of mass is distributed
      over a larger volume, resulting in a lower density.


      Step 4: Apply the comparison to potassium and sodium.

      Sodium has a lower atomic mass (22.990 g/mol) compared to potassium (39.098
      g/mol).

      Sodium also has a smaller atomic radius (186 pm) compared to potassium (227
      pm).


      Step 5: Conclude the answer.

      Based on the comparison of the atomic properties, sodium has a lower atomic
      mass and a larger atomic radius compared to potassium. Therefore, sodium is
      less dense than potassium.

      Step 1: Understand the concept of density.

      Density is the mass per unit volume of a substance. It is calculated by dividing
      the mass of a substance by its volume.
