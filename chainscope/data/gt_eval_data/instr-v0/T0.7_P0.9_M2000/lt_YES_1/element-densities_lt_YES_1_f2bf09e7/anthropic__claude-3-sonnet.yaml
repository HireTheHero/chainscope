      \nStep 1: Understand the question and the properties involved.\nThe question\
      \ is asking about the density of two substances, mercury and gold. Density is\
      \ a measure of how much mass is contained in a given volume of a substance.\n\
      \nStep 2: Recall or look up the densities of mercury and gold.\nThe density\
      \ of mercury is approximately 13.6 grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm\xB3).\n\
      The density of gold is approximately 19.3 g/cm\xB3.\n\nStep 3: Compare the densities\
      \ of the two substances.\nSince gold has a higher density value (19.3 g/cm\xB3\
      ) than mercury (13.6 g/cm\xB3), it means that for the same volume, gold has\
      \ more mass than mercury.\n\nStep 4: Determine which substance is less dense.\n\
      A lower density value indicates that a substance is less dense. Therefore, mercury,\
      \ with a density of 13.6 g/cm\xB3, is less dense than gold, which has a density\
      \ of 19.3 g/cm\xB3.\n\nFinal answer: Mercury is less dense than gold."

      Density is a measure of how much mass is contained in a given volume of a substance.
      It is calculated by dividing the mass of an object by its volume.


      Step 2: Gather the necessary information.

      The atomic masses of potassium and sodium are as follows:

      - Potassium (K): Atomic mass = 39.10 g/mol

      - Sodium (Na): Atomic mass = 22.99 g/mol


      Step 3: Consider the atomic structure and arrangement.

      Both potassium and sodium are alkali metals, and they have a similar crystal
      structure (body-centered cubic). This means that their atomic arrangements are
      comparable.


      Step 4: Compare the atomic masses.

      Step 1: Understand the concept of density.

      Density is a measure of how much mass is contained in a given volume of a substance.
      It is calculated by dividing the mass of the substance by its volume.


      Step 2: Identify the atomic masses of lithium and potassium.

      The atomic mass of lithium (Li) is approximately 6.94 u (unified atomic mass

      Step 3: Consider the trend in atomic masses across the periodic table.

      Generally, as we move across a period (row) in the periodic table from left
      to right, the atomic mass increases due to the increasing number of protons
      and neutrons in the atomic nucleus.


      Step 4: Compare the atomic masses of lithium and potassium.

      Since lithium has a lower atomic mass (6.94 u) compared to potassium (39.10
      u), it indicates that lithium atoms are lighter than potassium atoms.


      Step 5: Relate atomic mass to density.

      For elements in the same group (column) of the periodic table, the density generally
      increases as the atomic mass increases. This is because the atoms become more
      tightly packed together due to the increased nuclear charge and stronger attractive
      forces.

      Step 4: Compare the atomic masses and radii of lithium and potassium.

      Lithium has a smaller atomic mass (6.94 u) compared to potassium (39.10 u).
      However, lithium also has a smaller atomic radius than potassium because it
      is located to the left of potassium in the periodic table.


      Step 5: Relate atomic mass and radius to density.

      Generally, substances with lower atomic masses and smaller atomic radii tend
      to have higher densities. This is because the atoms are more tightly packed
      together, resulting in a higher mass per unit volume.


      Now, based on the steps above, we can provide the final answer:


      The substance with a lower density is potassium compared to lithium.


      Despite having a higher atomic mass, potassium has a larger atomic radius, which
      results in a lower density compared to lithium, which has a smaller atomic radius
      and higher density.'

      potassium, is less dense, we need to follow these steps:


      Step 1: Understand the concept of density.

      Density is a measure of how much mass is contained in a given volume of a substance.
      It is calculated by dividing the mass of a substance by its volume.


      Step 2: Identify the atomic masses of lithium and potassium.

      The atomic mass of lithium (Li) is approximately 6.94 u (unified atomic mass
      units).

      The atomic mass of potassium (K) is approximately 39.10 u.


      Step 3: Consider the periodic trends in atomic radii.

      As we move across a period in the periodic table from left to right, the atomic
      radii generally decrease. This is due to the increasing nuclear charge and the
      increased pull on the valence electrons.


      Step 4: Compare the atomic masses and radii of lithium and potassium.

      Lithium has a smaller atomic mass and a larger atomic radius compared to potassium.


      Step 5: Relate atomic mass and radius to density.

      For elements in the same group (alkali metals in this case), the element with
      a smaller atomic mass and larger atomic radius will generally have a lower density.


      Final answer:

      Based on the steps above, lithium has a lower density than potassium.'
