      1. Great Wall of China (Ming Dynasty section):

      - The Ming Dynasty ruled from 1368 to 1644

      - Most of the stone and brick Great Wall we see today was built during this
      period

      - Significant wall construction happened between late 14th to early 17th centuries


      2. Taj Mahal:

      - Construction began in 1632

      - Completed around 1653

      - Built during the Mughal Empire by Shah Jahan


      3. Comparing timelines:

      - Ming Dynasty Great Wall construction: Late 14th to early 17th centuries

      - Taj Mahal construction: 1632-1653

      - This means the Great Wall was already being built before the Taj Mahal''s
