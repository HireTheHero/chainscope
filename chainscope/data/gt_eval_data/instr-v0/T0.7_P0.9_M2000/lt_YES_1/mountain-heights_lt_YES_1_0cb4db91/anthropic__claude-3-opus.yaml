      step:


      1. Mount Kilimanjaro is located in Tanzania, Africa, while Mount Denali (formerly
      known as Mount McKinley) is located in Alaska, United States.


      2. Mount Kilimanjaro is known for being the highest mountain in Africa, with
      a summit elevation of 5,895 meters (19,341 feet) above sea level.


      3. Mount Denali is the highest mountain in North America, with a summit elevation
      of 6,190 meters (20,310 feet) above sea level.


      4. Comparing the elevations, Mount Denali is 295 meters (969 feet) higher than
      Mount Kilimanjaro.


      Final answer: Mount Kilimanjaro is lower than Mount Denali.'
    0bccd720-4aeb-4da3-9c98-bc12cbe2ba7a: 'To determine which mountain is lower, Mount
      Kilimanjaro or Mount Denali, let''s follow these steps:


      Step 1: Identify the location of each mountain.

      - Mount Kilimanjaro is located in Tanzania, Africa.

      - Mount Denali (formerly known as Mount McKinley) is located in Alaska, United
      States.


      Step 2: Find the elevation of each mountain.

      - Mount Kilimanjaro has an elevation of 5,895 meters (19,341 feet) above sea
      level.

      - Mount Denali has an elevation of 6,190 meters (20,310 feet) above sea level.


      Step 3: Compare the elevations of the two mountains.

      - Mount Kilimanjaro: 5,895 meters (19,341 feet)

      - Mount Denali: 6,190 meters (20,310 feet)


      Final Answer:

      Mount Kilimanjaro, with an elevation of 5,895 meters (19,341 feet), is lower
      than Mount Denali, which has an elevation of 6,190 meters (20,310 feet).'

      - The Matterhorn is located on the border between Switzerland and Italy, in
      the Alps.

      - Mont Blanc is located on the border between France and Italy, also in the
      Alps.


      Step 2: Determine the height of each mountain.

      - The Matterhorn stands at 4,478 meters (14,692 feet) tall.

      - Mont Blanc is 4,808 meters (15,774 feet) tall.


      Step 3: Compare the heights of the two mountains.

      - Mont Blanc is 330 meters (1,082 feet) taller than the Matterhorn.

      1. Mount Kangchenjunga and Mount K2 are both very high mountains, but to determine
      which one is lower, we need to know their exact heights.


      2. Mount Kangchenjunga is the third highest mountain in the world, with an elevation
      of 8,586 meters (28,169 feet) above sea level.


      3. Mount K2, also known as Mount Godwin-Austen or Chhogori, is the second highest
      mountain in the world, with an elevation of 8,611 meters (28,251 feet) above

      4. Comparing the elevations, we can see that Mount Kangchenjunga is 8,586 meters
      tall, while Mount K2 is 8,611 meters tall.


      5. Since 8,586 meters is less than 8,611 meters, Mount Kangchenjunga is lower
