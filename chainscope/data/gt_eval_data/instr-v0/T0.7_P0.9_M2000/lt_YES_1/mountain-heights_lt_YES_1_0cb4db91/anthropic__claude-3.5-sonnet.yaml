    27f6ff53-e9a0-4c98-95b6-b10618990db8: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, I need to recall the heights of both mountains:

      - Mount Kilimanjaro is approximately 5,895 meters (19,341 feet)

      - Mount Denali is approximately 6,190 meters (20,310 feet)


      2. To compare them, I should use the same unit of measurement

      - Both heights are already in meters, so I can compare directly


      3. Comparing the numbers:

      - 5,895 m < 6,190 m

      - Therefore, Kilimanjaro is shorter than Denali


      Answer: Mount Kilimanjaro is lower than Mount Denali.'

      2. To compare them, I''ll use the same unit (feet):

      * Kilimanjaro: 19,341 feet

      * Denali: 20,310 feet


      3. 20,310 is greater than 19,341, which means:

      * Denali is higher

      * Therefore, Kilimanjaro is lower


      Final answer: Mount Kilimanjaro is lower than Mount Denali.'

      * Denali is 295 meters higher than Kilimanjaro


      Therefore, Mount Kilimanjaro is the lower of the two mountains.

      1. First, let me recall the heights of these mountains:

      - Mount Whitney is 14,505 feet (4,421 meters) high

      - The Matterhorn is 14,692 feet (4,478 meters) high


      2. To compare them, I should use the same unit of measurement:

      - Both heights are already listed in feet, so I can directly compare

      - Mount Whitney: 14,505 feet

      - Matterhorn: 14,692 feet


      3. Comparing the numbers:

      - 14,692 > 14,505
