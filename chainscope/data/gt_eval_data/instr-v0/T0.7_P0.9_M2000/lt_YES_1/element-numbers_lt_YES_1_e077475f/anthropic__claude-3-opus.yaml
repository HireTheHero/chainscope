      Step 3: Compare the positions of lead and uranium on the periodic table.

      Elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number from left to right
      and top to bottom on the periodic table. Since lead is located in period 6 and
      uranium is located in period 7, lead appears before uranium on the periodic
      table.


      Step 4: Conclude which element has a lower atomic number.

      As lead appears before uranium on the periodic table, it must have a lower atomic
      number than uranium.


      Final answer: Lead (Pb) has a lower atomic number than uranium (U).'

      atomic number between lead and uranium, let''s think through this step by step:


      Step 1: Understand what atomic number means.

      The atomic number of an element is the number of protons in its nucleus. It
      is a unique identifier for each element and determines its position on the periodic
      table.


      Step 2: Recall the arrangement of the periodic table.

      The periodic table is arranged in order of increasing atomic number from left
      to right and top to bottom. This means that elements with lower atomic numbers
      are located towards the top and left of the table, while those with higher atomic
      numbers are found towards the bottom and right.


      Step 3: Locate lead and uranium on the periodic table.

      Lead (Pb) is located in period 6 and group 14 of the periodic table.

      Uranium (U) is located in period 7 and in the actinide series, which is positioned
      below the main body of the periodic table.


      Step 4: Compare the positions of lead and uranium.

      Since uranium is located in a period below lead and is positioned in the actinide
      series, it has a higher atomic number than lead.


      Final answer: Lead (Pb) has a lower atomic number compared to uranium (U).'

      - The atomic number is the number of protons in an atom''s nucleus. It is a
      unique identifier for each element on the periodic table.


      Step 2: Recall the periodic table''s organization.

      - The periodic table is organized in order of increasing atomic number from

      - Uranium (U) is located in period 7 and group 3 (in the actinide series).


      Step 4: Compare the positions of lead and uranium.

      - Lead is located in a higher group (14) than uranium (group 3).

      - However, lead is located in a lower period (6) compared to uranium (period
      7).


      Step 5: Determine which factor takes precedence in determining atomic number.

      - The period number takes precedence over the group number when determining
      the order of elements by atomic number.

      - Elements in lower periods have lower atomic numbers than elements in higher
      periods.


      Final answer: Lead (Pb) has a lower atomic number than uranium (U) because lead
      is located in a lower period on the periodic table.'

      are in the same row.

      - Mercury is located to the right of gold in the periodic table.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on the elements'' positions.

      - Since elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number from left

      elements in lower groups (located more to the left) generally have lower atomic
      numbers than elements in higher groups.


      Final answer: Based on the information gathered, zinc (Zn) has a lower atomic
      number than silver (Ag) because it is located in a lower period (period 4) on
      the periodic table compared to silver (period 5).'

      proton in its nucleus. Therefore, hydrogen''s atomic number is 1.


      3. Helium: Helium is the second element on the periodic table, coming right
      after hydrogen. Since it comes after hydrogen, it must have more protons in
      its nucleus than hydrogen. Helium has two protons in its nucleus, so its atomic
      number is 2.


      4. Comparing atomic numbers: Hydrogen has an atomic number of 1, while helium
      has an atomic number of 2. 1 is less than 2.
