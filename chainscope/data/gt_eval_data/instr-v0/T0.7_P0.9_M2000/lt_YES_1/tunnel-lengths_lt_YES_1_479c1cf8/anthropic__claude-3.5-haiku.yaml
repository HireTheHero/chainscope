      - Located in Zion National Park, Utah

      - Constructed in the 1920s

      - Length is approximately 1.1 miles (5,613 feet)


      2. Locate information about the Queens-Midtown Tunnel:

      - Connects Manhattan and Queens in New York City

      - Opened in 1940

      - Length is approximately 0.89 miles (4,700 feet)


      3. Compare the lengths:

      - Zion-Mount Carmel Tunnel: 1.1 miles

      - Queens-Midtown Tunnel: 0.89 miles
