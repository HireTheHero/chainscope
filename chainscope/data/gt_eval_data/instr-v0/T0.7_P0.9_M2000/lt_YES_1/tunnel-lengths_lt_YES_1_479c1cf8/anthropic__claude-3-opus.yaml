      follow these steps:


      Step 1: Identify the location of each tunnel.

      - Zion-Mount Carmel Tunnel is located in Zion National Park, Utah, USA.

      - Queens-Midtown Tunnel is located in New York City, connecting the boroughs
      of Queens and Manhattan.


      Step 2: Research the length of each tunnel.

      - Zion-Mount Carmel Tunnel: According to the National Park Service, the Zion-Mount
      Carmel Tunnel is 1.1 miles (1.8 km) long.

      - Queens-Midtown Tunnel: According to the MTA (Metropolitan Transportation Authority),
      the Queens-Midtown Tunnel is 1.2 miles (1.9 km) long.


      Step 3: Compare the lengths of the tunnels.

      - Zion-Mount Carmel Tunnel: 1.1 miles (1.8 km)

      - Queens-Midtown Tunnel: 1.2 miles (1.9 km)


      Final Answer: The Zion-Mount Carmel Tunnel is shorter than the Queens-Midtown
      Tunnel by 0.1 miles (0.1 km).'
    69134155-6f28-4499-bd01-590430cd327c: 'Okay, let''s think through this step by
      step:


      1. The Zion-Mount Carmel Tunnel is located in Zion National Park, Utah. It was
      constructed to provide a route through the mountains, connecting Zion Canyon
      to the east side of the park.


      2. The Queens-Midtown Tunnel is located in New York City. It runs under the
      East River, connecting the borough of Queens on Long Island with the borough
      of Manhattan.


      3. Tunnels through mountains are typically longer than tunnels under rivers,
      as mountains are usually wider than rivers.


      4. The Zion-Mount Carmel Tunnel is 1.1 miles (1.8 km) long, according to the
      National Park Service.


      5. The Queens-Midtown Tunnel is 1.2 miles (1.9 km) long, according to the MTA
      (Metropolitan Transportation Authority) which operates the tunnel.


      Final answer: The Zion-Mount Carmel Tunnel is slightly shorter than the Queens-Midtown
