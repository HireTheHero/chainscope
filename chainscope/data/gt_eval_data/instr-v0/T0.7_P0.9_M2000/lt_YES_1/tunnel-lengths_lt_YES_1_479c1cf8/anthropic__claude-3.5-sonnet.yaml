      - It is approximately 16.9 km (10.5 miles) long


      2. Now I can compare:

      - Mont Blanc: 11.6 km

      - St. Gotthard: 16.9 km

      - 16.9 km is greater than 11.6 km


      3. Therefore, Mont Blanc Tunnel is shorter than St. Gotthard Road Tunnel by
      about 5.3 km.


      Final answer: Mont Blanc Tunnel is shorter.'
