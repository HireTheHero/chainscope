      - Zion-Mount Carmel Tunnel is located in Zion National Park, Utah.

      - Queens-Midtown Tunnel connects the borough of Queens to Midtown Manhattan
      in New York City.


      Step 2: Compare the lengths of the two tunnels.

      - The Zion-Mount Carmel Tunnel is 1.1 miles (1.8 km) long.

      - The Queens-Midtown Tunnel is 6,000 feet (1.1 miles or 1.8 km) long.


      Step 3: Analyze the information and determine the shorter tunnel.

      Since the Zion-Mount Carmel Tunnel is 1.1 miles long and the Queens-Midtown
      Tunnel is also 1.1 miles long, the two tunnels are the same length.


      Final answer: The Zion-Mount Carmel Tunnel and the Queens-Midtown Tunnel are
