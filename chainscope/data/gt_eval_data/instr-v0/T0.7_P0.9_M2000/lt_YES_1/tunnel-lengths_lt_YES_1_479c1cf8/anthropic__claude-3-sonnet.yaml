      in Japan. It is 53.85 km (33.46 miles) long, making it the longest and deepest
      operational rail tunnel in the world.


      Step 4: Compare the lengths of the two tunnels.

      The Channel Tunnel is 37.9 km (23.5 miles) long, while the Seikan Tunnel is
      53.85 km (33.46 miles) long.

      - The Channel Tunnel is an underwater rail tunnel that connects the island of
      Great Britain with mainland Europe, running under the English Channel between
      England and France.

      - The Seikan Tunnel is an underwater rail tunnel that links the islands of Honshu
      and Hokkaido in Japan, running under the Tsugaru Strait.


      Step 2: Find the length of each tunnel.

      - The Channel Tunnel is approximately 50.5 km (31.4 miles) long.

      - The Seikan Tunnel is approximately 53.9 km (33.5 miles) long.


      Step 3: Compare the lengths of the two tunnels.

      - The Channel Tunnel is an undersea tunnel that connects France and the United
      Kingdom, running beneath the English Channel.

      - The Seikan Tunnel is an undersea tunnel that connects the islands of Honshu
      and Hokkaido in Japan, running beneath the Tsugaru Strait.


      Step 2: Find the length of each tunnel.

      - The Channel Tunnel has a total length of 50.5 km (31.4 miles), with 37.9 km

      - The Seikan Tunnel has a total length of 53.85 km (33.46 miles), with 23.3
      km (14.5 miles) of that being the undersea portion.


      Step 3: Compare the lengths of the two tunnels.

      - The Channel Tunnel has a total length of 50.5 km.

      - The Seikan Tunnel has a total length of 53.85 km.


      Step 4: Determine which tunnel is shorter.

      - Since 50.5 km is less than 53.85 km, the Channel Tunnel is shorter than the
      Seikan Tunnel.

      - Location: Under the Swiss Alps, connecting the cantons of Uri and Ticino in
      Switzerland.

      - Length: Approximately 16.9 kilometers (10.5 miles).


      Step 3: Compare the lengths of the two tunnels.

      The Mont Blanc Tunnel has a length of approximately 11.6 kilometers (7.2 miles),
      while the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel is longer at approximately 16.9 kilometers
      (10.5 miles).


      Step 4: Determine the shorter tunnel based on the comparison.

      Since the Mont Blanc Tunnel is shorter in length compared to the St. Gotthard
      Road Tunnel, the Mont Blanc Tunnel is the shorter of the two.


      Final Answer: The Mont Blanc Tunnel is shorter than the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel.'

      Step 1: Identify the two tunnels in question.

      - Mont Blanc Tunnel

      - St. Gotthard Road Tunnel


      Step 2: Gather information about the length of each tunnel.

      - The Mont Blanc Tunnel is 11.6 km (7.2 miles) long. It is a road tunnel under
      the Mont Blanc mountain, connecting Chamonix, France, and Courmayeur, Italy.

      - The St. Gotthard Road Tunnel is 16.9 km (10.5 miles) long. It is a road tunnel
      through the Swiss Alps, connecting the cantons of Uri and Ticino in Switzerland.


      Step 3: Compare the lengths of the two tunnels.

      - The Mont Blanc Tunnel is 11.6 km long.

      - The St. Gotthard Road Tunnel is 16.9 km long.

      - 16.9 km is greater than 11.6 km.


      Step 4: Determine the shorter tunnel based on the comparison.

      - Since the Mont Blanc Tunnel is 11.6 km long, and the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel
      is 16.9 km long, the Mont Blanc Tunnel is shorter than the St. Gotthard Road
      Tunnel.


      Final Answer: The Mont Blanc Tunnel is shorter than the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel.'
