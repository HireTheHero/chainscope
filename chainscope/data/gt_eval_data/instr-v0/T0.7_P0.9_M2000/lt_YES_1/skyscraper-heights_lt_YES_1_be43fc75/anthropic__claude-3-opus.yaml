      1. The Chrysler Building is a famous skyscraper located in New York City. It
      was completed in 1930 and stood as the world''s tallest building for 11 months
      before it was surpassed by the Empire State Building.


      2. The Bank of America Tower is also a skyscraper in New York City. It was completed
      in 2009, nearly 80 years after the Chrysler Building.


      3. Skyscraper technology and engineering have advanced significantly over the
      years, allowing for taller buildings to be constructed. Therefore, it''s likely
      that a more recently built skyscraper would be taller than an older one.


      4. To confirm, I would need to look up the exact heights of both buildings.
      The Chrysler Building stands at 1,046 feet (319 meters), while the Bank of America
      Tower is 1,200 feet (366 meters) tall.

      The Bank of America Tower, located in New York City, stands at a height of 1,200
      feet (365.8 meters).


      Step 2: Find the height of the Empire State Building.

      The Empire State Building, also located in New York City, has a roof height
      of 1,250 feet (381 meters) and a total height, including its antenna spire,
      of 1,454 feet (443.2 meters).

      When comparing the heights, we should consider the roof height of the Empire
      State Building, which is 1,250 feet, rather than its total height with the antenna
      spire.


      The Bank of America Tower has a height of 1,200 feet, while the Empire State

      Empire State Building (without antenna): 1,250 feet (381 meters)

      30 Hudson Yards: 1,268 feet (386.6 meters)


      Final answer: The Empire State Building is taller than 30 Hudson Yards when
      considering its full height with the antenna. However, if we compare the heights
      without the antenna, 30 Hudson Yards is slightly taller than the Empire State
      Building by 18 feet (5.6 meters). Therefore, the Empire State Building (without
      antenna) is shorter than 30 Hudson Yards.'

      between the Empire State Building and 30 Hudson Yards, let''s break it down
      step by step:


      Step 1: Find the height of the Empire State Building.

      The Empire State Building, located in New York City, stands at a height of 1,454
      feet (443.2 meters) tall, including its antenna spire. Without the antenna spire,
      it is 1,250 feet (381 meters) tall.


      Step 2: Find the height of 30 Hudson Yards.

      30 Hudson Yards, also located in New York City, is part of the Hudson Yards
      Redevelopment Project. It stands at a height of 1,268 feet (387 meters) tall.


      Step 3: Compare the heights of both skyscrapers.

      Empire State Building (with antenna spire): 1,454 feet (443.2 meters)

      Empire State Building (without antenna spire): 1,250 feet (381 meters)

      30 Hudson Yards: 1,268 feet (387 meters)


      Final Answer:

      30 Hudson Yards, at 1,268 feet (387 meters), is shorter than the Empire State
      Building when considering the Empire State Building''s full height with its
      antenna spire (1,454 feet or 443.2 meters). However, if we consider the Empire
      State Building''s height without the antenna spire (1,250 feet or 381 meters),
      then the Empire State Building is shorter than 30 Hudson Yards.'

      2. Taipei 101 is located in Taipei, Taiwan. It was completed in 2004 and also
      has 101 floors.


      3. Since both buildings have the same number of floors, we can''t determine
      which one is shorter based on that information alone. We need to look at the
      actual height of each building.


      4. The Shanghai World Financial Center has a height of 492 meters (1,614 feet).


      5. Taipei 101 has a height of 508 meters (1,667 feet).


      6. Comparing the heights, we can see that Taipei 101 is taller than the Shanghai
      World Financial Center by 16 meters (53 feet).


      Therefore, the final answer is: The Shanghai World Financial Center is shorter
      than Taipei 101.'
