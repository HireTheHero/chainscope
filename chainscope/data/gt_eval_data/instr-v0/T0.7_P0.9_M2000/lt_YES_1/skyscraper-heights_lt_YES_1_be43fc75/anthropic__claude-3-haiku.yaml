      The question is asking to compare the heights of two skyscrapers: Shanghai World
      Financial Center and Taipei 101.


      Step 2: Look up the heights of the two skyscrapers.

      According to available information:

      - Shanghai World Financial Center is 492 meters (1,614 feet) tall.

      - Taipei 101 is 508 meters (1,667 feet) tall.


      Step 3: Compare the heights of the two skyscrapers.

      By comparing the heights, we can see that Taipei 101, at 508 meters, is taller
      than the Shanghai World Financial Center, which is 492 meters tall.


      Therefore, the answer is:

      The Shanghai World Financial Center is shorter than the Taipei 101.'
