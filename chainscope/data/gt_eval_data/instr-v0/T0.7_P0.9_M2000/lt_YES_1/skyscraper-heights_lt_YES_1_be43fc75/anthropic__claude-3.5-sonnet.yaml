      1. First, let me recall the heights of both buildings:

      - Taipei 101 is 509 meters (1,671 feet) tall

      - One World Trade Center is 541 meters (1,776 feet) tall


      2. Comparing these numbers:

      - 541 meters > 509 meters

      - 1,776 feet > 1,671 feet


      3. Since One World Trade Center is taller by both measurements (about 32 meters
      or 105 feet taller), that means Taipei 101 is the shorter building.


      Answer: Taipei 101 is shorter than One World Trade Center.'

      - Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur are 451.9 meters (1,483 feet) to their architectural
      tops


      2. Looking at these numbers:

      - 451.9 meters > 442 meters

      - 1,483 feet > 1,451 feet


      Therefore, Willis Tower is shorter than the Petronas Towers.


      Final answer: Willis Tower is shorter.'

      - Willis Tower (formerly Sears Tower) is 1,451 feet (442 m) tall


      3. Now I can compare:

      - Willis Tower: 1,451 feet

      - 30 Hudson Yards: 1,268 feet

      - 1,451 > 1,268


      Therefore, 30 Hudson Yards is shorter than Willis Tower.


      Final answer: 30 Hudson Yards is shorter.'
