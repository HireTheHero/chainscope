      1. The Hubble Space Telescope and the International Space Station (ISS) are
      both prominent space satellites, but they serve different purposes.


      2. The Hubble Space Telescope is an orbital telescope that was launched into
      space to observe astronomical objects. It was launched in 1990.


      3. The International Space Station is a large orbiting laboratory that has been
      continuously inhabited by astronauts since 2000. It was assembled in space over
      many years, with the first module being launched in 1998.

      earlier, Hubble Space Telescope or the International Space Station, let''s go
      through the step-by-step reasoning:


      Step 1: Identify the launch dates of the Hubble Space Telescope and the International
      Space Station.

      - The Hubble Space Telescope was launched on April 24, 1990.

      - The International Space Station (ISS) was launched in multiple stages, with
      the first module (Zarya) launched on November 20, 1998.
