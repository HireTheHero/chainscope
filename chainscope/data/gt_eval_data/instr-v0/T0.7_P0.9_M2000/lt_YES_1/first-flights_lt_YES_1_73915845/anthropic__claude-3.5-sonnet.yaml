      3. The Supermarine Spitfire made its first flight on March 5, 1936


      4. Comparing these dates:

      - December 1935 comes before March 1936

      - Therefore the DC-3 flew about 3 months earlier than the Spitfire


      Final answer: The DC-3 made its first flight earlier than the Spitfire.'
