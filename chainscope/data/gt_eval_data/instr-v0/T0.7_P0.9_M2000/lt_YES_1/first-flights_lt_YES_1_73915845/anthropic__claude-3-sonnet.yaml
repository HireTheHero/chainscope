      Step 1: Identify the aircraft mentioned in the question.

      The two aircraft mentioned are the B-52 Stratofortress and the SR-71 Blackbird.


      Step 2: Recall or research the first flight dates of each aircraft.

      The B-52 Stratofortress made its first flight on April 15, 1952.

      The SR-71 Blackbird made its first flight on December 22, 1964.


      Step 3: Compare the first flight dates of the two aircraft.

      The B-52 Stratofortress first flew in 1952, while the SR-71 Blackbird first
      flew in 1964.


      Step 4: Determine which aircraft made its first flight earlier based on the
      comparison.

      Since 1952 is earlier than 1964, the B-52 Stratofortress made its first flight
      earlier than the SR-71 Blackbird.
