      - It was first introduced in 1973.


      Step 2: Determine the release year of the VHS Player.

      - VHS (Video Home System) was a consumer-level analog video recording cassette
      standard.

      - The first VHS video recorder was released by JVC (Japan Victor Company) in
      1976.


      Step 3: Compare the release years of Xerox Alto and VHS Player.

      - Xerox Alto: 1973

      - VHS Player: 1976

      - 1973 is earlier than 1976.


      Final answer: The Xerox Alto was released earlier than the VHS Player. The Xerox
      Alto was introduced in 1973, while the first VHS video recorder was released

      Step 1: Recall the approximate release years of the Apple iPod and iPhone.

      - The Apple iPod was first released in the early 2000s.

      - The Apple iPhone was introduced in the mid to late 2000s.


      Step 2: Consider the primary functions of each device.

      - The iPod was primarily a portable music player.

      - The iPhone, while it could play music, was primarily a smartphone with additional
      features like a camera, internet connectivity, and apps.


      Step 3: Think about the evolution of portable technology.

      - Portable music players, like the iPod, were popular before the widespread
      adoption of smartphones.
