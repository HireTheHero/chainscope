      - Boeing 747-400: Mach 0.855 (about 570 mph / 917 km/h)


      2. Converting to the same units to compare:

      - Both speeds are already in Mach numbers, which makes comparison easier

      - 787: Mach 0.85

      - P-51 Mustang maximum speed: around 440 mph (710 km/h)

      - Airbus A320 cruising speed: around 511 mph (823 km/h)


      3. For a fair comparison, we should use maximum speed for both or cruising speed
      for both:

      - P-51 Mustang maximum speed: 440 mph

      - A320 maximum speed: around 541 mph (Mach 0.82)


      4. Comparing these numbers:

      440 mph < 541 mph


      Therefore, the P-51 Mustang is the slower aircraft of the two.

      - F-22 Raptor: Maximum speed is Mach 2.25 (approximately 2,410 km/h)


      2) Converting to the same units:

      - Both aircraft have the same Mach number (2.25)

      - In km/h, they''re very close with the F-22 being slightly faster


      3) Comparing:

      - Since they have identical Mach numbers but the F-22 has a slightly higher
      km/h speed

      - This means the MiG-29 is marginally slower


      Final answer: The MiG-29 is slower than the F-22 Raptor, though the difference

      3. Reasoning:

      - Both aircraft were designed as air superiority fighters

      - They have practically identical maximum speeds

      - The tiny difference in reported km/h speeds is not significant enough to definitively
      say one is slower


      Therefore, neither aircraft is definitively slower - they have essentially the

    ecf51973-1e28-4596-80b8-44b54238f011: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, I need to recall the typical cruise speeds of both aircraft:

      - Airbus A380 cruise speed: around Mach 0.85 (about 560 mph / 900 km/h)

      - Boeing 737-800 cruise speed: around Mach 0.78 (about 515 mph / 830 km/h)


      2. Next, I need to compare these speeds:

      - Mach 0.85 > Mach 0.78

      - 560 mph > 515 mph


      3. Therefore:

      - The A380 is actually faster than the 737-800

      - This means the 737-800 is the slower of the two aircraft


      Final answer: The Boeing 737-800 is slower than the Airbus A380.'

      - Boeing 737-800 cruise speed: around Mach 0.785 (about 530 mph/850 km/h)


      2. Both speeds are given in Mach numbers, which makes comparison easier.

      - Mach 0.85 > Mach 0.785


      3. Converting to more familiar units confirms:

      - A380: ~560 mph

      - 737-800: ~530 mph


      4. Comparing these numbers:

      560 mph > 530 mph


      Therefore, the Boeing 737-800 is the slower aircraft of the two.


      Final answer: The Boeing 737-800 is slower than the Airbus A380.'
