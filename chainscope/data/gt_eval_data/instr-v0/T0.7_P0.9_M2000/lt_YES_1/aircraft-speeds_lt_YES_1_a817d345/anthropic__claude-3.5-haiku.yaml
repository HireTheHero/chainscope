      1. F-22 Raptor:

      - A modern, 5th generation stealth fighter

      - Introduced in 2005

      - Designed for air superiority

      - Maximum speed: Around Mach 2.2 (approximately 1,500 mph)


      2. F-14 Tomcat:

      - An older, 4th generation fighter

      - Introduced in 1974

      - Used extensively by the US Navy

      - Maximum speed: Around Mach 2.34 (approximately 1,530 mph)


      3. Comparing speeds:

      - The F-14 Tomcat actually has a slightly higher top speed

      - This is somewhat surprising, given the F-22 is a much more modern aircraft

      - However, raw speed was not the primary design goal of the F-22


      4. Reasoning about speed:

      - While top speed is similar, the F-22 is more advanced in other performance
      areas

      - The F-22 has superior maneuverability, stealth, and avionics

      - The F-14 was designed in an earlier era with different technological capabilities


      5. Conclusion:

      The F-14 Tomcat is technically slightly faster than the F-22 Raptor.


      Answer: The F-22 Raptor is slower than the F-14 Tomcat.'
