      a step-by-step approach:


      Step 1: Understand the question and the aircraft types mentioned.

      The question is asking which of the two aircraft, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner
      or the Boeing 747-400, has a slower cruising speed.


      Step 2: Gather information about the cruising speeds of the two aircraft.

      According to Boeing''s specifications:

      - The Boeing 787 Dreamliner has a cruising speed of Mach 0.85 (around 650 mph
      or 1,046 km/h at typical cruising altitudes).

      - The Boeing 747-400 has a cruising speed of Mach 0.855 (around 567 mph or 912
      km/h at typical cruising altitudes).


      Step 3: Compare the cruising speeds of the two aircraft.

      The Boeing 747-400 has a slightly lower cruising speed (Mach 0.855) compared
      to the Boeing 787 Dreamliner (Mach 0.85).


      Step 4: Determine the slower aircraft based on the comparison.

      Since the Boeing 747-400 has a lower cruising speed than the Boeing 787 Dreamliner,
      it is considered the slower aircraft of the two.

      mph or 2,400 km/h) at high altitude.


      The Concorde had a cruising speed of Mach 2.02 (approximately 1,350 mph or 2,170
      km/h) at its typical cruising altitude of 60,000 feet (18,300 meters).


      Step 4: Determine which aircraft is slower based on the cruising speeds.

      Although the maximum speed of the F-16 Fighting Falcon is slightly higher than
      the cruising speed of the Concorde, the Concorde''s typical cruising speed is
      lower than the F-16''s maximum speed.


      Final Answer: Based on the step-by-step reasoning, the Concorde, with its typical
      cruising speed of around Mach 2.02, is slower than the F-16 Fighting Falcon,
      which can reach a maximum speed of Mach 2.05.'

      The question is asking which of the two aircraft, the Airbus A320 or the Airbus
      A380, has a slower cruising speed.


      Step 2: Gather information about the aircraft.

      The Airbus A320 is a single-aisle, narrow-body aircraft used for short-to-medium-range
      flights, while the Airbus A380 is a double-deck, wide-body aircraft designed
      for long-haul flights.


      Step 3: Compare the cruising speeds of the two aircraft.

      According to the specifications provided by Airbus:

      - The Airbus A320 has a typical cruising speed of around 840 km/h (460 knots).

      - The Airbus A380 has a typical cruising speed of around 900 km/h (485 knots).


      Step 4: Determine which aircraft is slower.

      Based on the cruising speed information, the Airbus A320 has a slower cruising
      speed of 840 km/h compared to the Airbus A380''s cruising speed of 900 km/h.

      the following steps:


      Step 1: Understand the types of aircraft being compared.

      The Airbus A320 is a single-aisle, narrow-body aircraft designed for short-to-medium-range
      flights, while the Airbus A380 is a double-deck, wide-body aircraft designed
      for long-haul flights.


      Step 2: Consider the size and weight of the aircraft.

      Generally, larger and heavier aircraft tend to have lower cruising speeds compared
      to smaller and lighter aircraft due to increased drag and other factors.


      Step 3: Compare the typical cruising speeds of the two aircraft.

      According to specifications:

      - The Airbus A320 has a typical cruising speed of around 830 km/h (510 mph or
      Mach 0.78).

      - The Airbus A380 has a typical cruising speed of around 900 km/h (560 mph or
      Mach 0.85).


      Step 4: Analyze the information and draw a conclusion.

      Based on the typical cruising speeds, the Airbus A380, being the larger and
      heavier aircraft, has a higher cruising speed compared to the Airbus A320.


      Final answer: The Airbus A320 is slower than the Airbus A380.'

      the Airbus A320 and the Airbus A380, we can follow these steps:


      Step 1: Understand the types of aircraft.

      The Airbus A320 is a narrow-body, twin-engine jet airliner, while the Airbus
      A380 is a wide-body, double-deck, four-engine jet airliner.


      Step 2: Consider the size and weight of the aircraft.

      Generally, larger and heavier aircraft have higher drag and require more thrust
      to overcome that drag, which can limit their maximum speed.


      The Airbus A380 is significantly larger and heavier than the Airbus A320. The
      A380 has a maximum takeoff weight of around 1.2 million pounds, while the A320
      has a maximum takeoff weight of around 170,000 pounds.


      Step 3: Compare the typical cruising speeds of the aircraft.

      The typical cruising speed of an aircraft is a good indicator of its overall
      speed capability.


      The Airbus A320 has a typical cruising speed of around Mach 0.78 (around 470-500
      knots or 870-925 km/h).

      The Airbus A380 has a typical cruising speed of around Mach 0.85 (around 500-550
      knots or 925-1020 km/h).


      Step 4: Conclude based on the information gathered.

      Since the Airbus A380 has a higher typical cruising speed than the Airbus A320,
      it can be concluded that the Airbus A320 is the slower of the two aircraft.

      Step 3: Consider the factors that affect aircraft speed.

      Aircraft speed is influenced by various factors, including engine power, aerodynamics,
      and weight. Generally, larger aircraft with more powerful engines tend to have
      higher cruising speeds compared to smaller aircraft.


      Step 4: Compare the aircraft specifications.

      The Airbus A380 is a much larger aircraft with four powerful engines, designed
      to carry more passengers and cargo over longer distances. In contrast, the Airbus
      A320 is a smaller, more fuel-efficient aircraft with two engines, optimized
      for shorter routes.
