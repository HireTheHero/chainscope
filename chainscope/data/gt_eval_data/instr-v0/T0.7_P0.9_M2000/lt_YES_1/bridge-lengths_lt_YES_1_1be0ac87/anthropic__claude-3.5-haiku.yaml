      1. First, identify the two bridges:

      - Manhattan Bridge is located in New York City, USA

      - Forth Bridge is located in Scotland, UK


      2. Consider their characteristics:

      - Manhattan Bridge is a suspension bridge crossing the East River

      - Forth Bridge is a cantilever railway bridge crossing the Firth of Forth


      3. Research their lengths:

      - Manhattan Bridge total length is approximately 6,855 feet (2,089 meters)

      - Forth Bridge total length is approximately 8,296 feet (2,529 meters)


      4. Compare their lengths:

      - Manhattan Bridge: 6,855 feet
