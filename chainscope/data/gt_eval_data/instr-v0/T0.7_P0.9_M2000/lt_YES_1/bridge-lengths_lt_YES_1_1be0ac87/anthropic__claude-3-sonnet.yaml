      these steps:


      Step 1: Understand the question and the bridges being compared.

      The question is asking which of the two bridges, the Golden Gate Bridge or the
      Sunshine Skyway Bridge, is shorter in length.


      Step 2: Gather information about the lengths of the two bridges.

      The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate strait,
      connecting San Francisco and Marin County in California. Its total length, including
      the suspension spans and side spans, is approximately 1.7 miles (2.7 kilometers).


      The Sunshine Skyway Bridge is a cable-stayed concrete bridge spanning the mouth
      of Tampa Bay in Florida. Its total length, including the main span and approach
      spans, is approximately 4.1 miles (6.6 kilometers).


      Step 3: Compare the lengths of the two bridges.

      By comparing the total lengths of the two bridges, we can see that the Sunshine
      Skyway Bridge, at 4.1 miles (6.6 kilometers), is longer than the Golden Gate
      Bridge, which is 1.7 miles (2.7 kilometers) long.


      Step 4: Provide the final answer.

      Based on the comparison of the lengths, the Golden Gate Bridge is shorter than
      the Sunshine Skyway Bridge.
