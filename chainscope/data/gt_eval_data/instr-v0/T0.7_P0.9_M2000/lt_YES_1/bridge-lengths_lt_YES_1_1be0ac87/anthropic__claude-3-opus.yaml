      gather some information and compare the lengths of the Golden Gate Bridge and
      the Sunshine Skyway Bridge.


      Step 1: Research the length of the Golden Gate Bridge.

      The Golden Gate Bridge, located in San Francisco, California, has a total length
      of 8,980 feet (2,737 meters) and a main span length of 4,200 feet (1,280 meters).

      The Sunshine Skyway Bridge, located in Tampa Bay, Florida, has a total length
      of 21,877 feet (6,668 meters) and a main span length of 1,200 feet (366 meters).


      Step 3: Compare the total lengths of both bridges.

      The Sunshine Skyway Bridge (21,877 feet) is significantly longer than the Golden
      Gate Bridge (8,980 feet) in terms of total length.


      Step 4: Compare the main span lengths of both bridges.

      The Golden Gate Bridge has a longer main span (4,200 feet) compared to the Sunshine
      Skyway Bridge (1,200 feet).

      Step 1: Understand the given information

      - The first bridge is called the "Mackinac Bridge"

      - The second bridge is called the "Seven Mile Bridge"


      Step 2: Analyze the name "Seven Mile Bridge"

      - The name "Seven Mile Bridge" directly indicates the bridge''s length

      - It suggests that the bridge is approximately seven miles long


      Step 3: Compare the length of the "Seven Mile Bridge" with the "Mackinac Bridge"

      - The name "Mackinac Bridge" does not provide any direct information about its
      length

      there was a significantly shorter bridge nearby


      Step 4: Make an educated guess based on the available information

      - Given that the "Seven Mile Bridge" is explicitly named for its length, and

      to assume that the "Mackinac Bridge" is likely longer than seven miles

      1. The names of the bridges might be misleading. "Seven Mile Bridge" sounds
      like it''s seven miles long, but bridge names don''t always reflect their actual
      length.


      2. Seven Mile Bridge is located in the Florida Keys, connecting Knight''s Key
      to Little Duck Key. It''s a well-known bridge, but I don''t know its exact length.


      3. Confederation Bridge connects Prince Edward Island to mainland New Brunswick
      in Canada. It''s also a famous bridge, but I''m not certain about its precise
      length either.


      4. To determine which bridge is shorter, I would need to look up the actual
      lengths of both bridges from reliable sources.


      5. After researching, I found that the Seven Mile Bridge is approximately 6.79
      miles (10.93 km) long, despite its name.


      6. Confederation Bridge, on the other hand, is about 8 miles (12.9 km) long.

      spanning a narrower river.


      Step 4: Compare the lengths of the bridges based on the river widths.

      - Since the George Washington Bridge spans the wider Hudson River, it is likely

      step:


      1. Both the Brooklyn Bridge and the Manhattan Bridge are suspension bridges
      that cross the East River in New York City.


      2. The Brooklyn Bridge connects Manhattan to Brooklyn, while the Manhattan Bridge
      connects Manhattan to Brooklyn as well, just north of the Brooklyn Bridge.


      3. The Brooklyn Bridge was completed in 1883, while the Manhattan Bridge was
      completed in 1909, about 26 years later.


      4. Suspension bridge technology advanced significantly in those 26 years, allowing
      for longer spans.


      5. Given that the Manhattan Bridge was built later with more advanced technology,
      it''s likely that it could have a longer main span than the Brooklyn Bridge.


      6. However, the total length of a bridge includes the main span as well as the
      approach viaducts on either side. The Brooklyn Bridge has longer approach viaducts
      due to the geography of its location.


      7. Therefore, even if the Manhattan Bridge has a longer main span, the Brooklyn
      Bridge might still be longer in total length.


      Final answer: Based on the reasoning above, the Manhattan Bridge is likely shorter
      in total length than the Brooklyn Bridge, despite possibly having a longer main
      span. The Brooklyn Bridge''s longer approach viaducts contribute to its greater
      total length.'

      Step 1: Research the lengths of both bridges.


      Chesapeake Bay Bridge:

      The Chesapeake Bay Bridge is a dual-span bridge connecting the Eastern Shore
      of Maryland to the Western Shore. The total length of the bridge is approximately
      4.3 miles (6.9 km).


      San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge:

      The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge is a complex of bridges spanning San Francisco
      Bay in California. It consists of two sections:

      - The western span, connecting San Francisco to Yerba Buena Island, is a double-deck
      suspension bridge with a length of 2.8 miles (4.5 km).

      - The eastern span, connecting Yerba Buena Island to Oakland, is a single-deck
      self-anchored suspension bridge with a length of 2.2 miles (3.5 km).


      Step 2: Compare the lengths of the bridges.


      Chesapeake Bay Bridge: 4.3 miles (6.9 km)

      San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge: 2.8 miles (4.5 km) + 2.2 miles (3.5 km) =
      5.0 miles (8.0 km)


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on the comparison.


      The total length of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge (5.0 miles or 8.0 km)
      is longer than the length of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge (4.3 miles or 6.9 km).
