      1. Motorola DynaTAC:

      - This was the first commercially available handheld cellular mobile phone

      - It was first released in 1983

      - Developed by Martin Cooper and his team at Motorola

      - Often considered the first truly portable cell phone


      2. ZX Spectrum:

      - A home computer released by Sinclair Research

      - It was first launched in April 1982

      - Popular in the United Kingdom and parts of Europe

      - An important early home computer for many enthusiasts


      3. Comparing release dates:

      - ZX Spectrum: April 1982

      - Motorola DynaTAC: 1983


      4. Determining which was released later:

      - The Motorola DynaTAC was released in 1983

      - This is later than the ZX Spectrum''s 1982 release


      Therefore, the Motorola DynaTAC was released later than the ZX Spectrum.

      1. First, let''s identify when each technology was released:


      VHS Player:

      - Developed by JVC (Japan Victor Company)

      - First introduced in Japan in 1976

      - Became widely available in the consumer market in late 1970s


      Xerox Alto:

      - Developed at Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center)

      - First prototype created in 1973

      - Completed in 1974

      - Not a commercial product, but a research computer that influenced later personal
      computers


      2. Comparing the timelines:

      - Xerox Alto: 1973-1974

      - VHS Player: 1976


      3. Determining which was released later:

      - The VHS Player was released later than the Xerox Alto


      Therefore, the VHS Player was released later.'
