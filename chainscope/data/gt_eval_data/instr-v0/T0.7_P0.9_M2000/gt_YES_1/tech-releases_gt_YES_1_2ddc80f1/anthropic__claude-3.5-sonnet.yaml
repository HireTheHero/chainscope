      1. First, let me recall when each device was released:

      - Sony Walkman was released in 1979

      - IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC) was released in 1981


      2. To determine which was later, I''ll compare these years:

      - 1979 (Walkman) comes before 1981 (IBM PC)

      - Therefore, 1981 is the later date


      3. Since the IBM PC was released in 1981, which is after the Walkman''s 1979
      release, the IBM PC was released later.


      Final answer: The IBM Personal Computer was released later than the Sony Walkman.'
