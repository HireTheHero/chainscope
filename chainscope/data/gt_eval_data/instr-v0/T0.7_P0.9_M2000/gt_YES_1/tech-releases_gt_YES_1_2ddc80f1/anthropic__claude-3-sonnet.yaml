      Step 3: Determine which one was released later, even if it''s just a matter
      of months.

      - Since both technologies were introduced in 1977, we need to look into more
      specific release dates to determine which one came later.

      - The Apple II was unveiled at the West Coast Computer Faire on April 16, 1977.

      - The first VHS player, the VP-1000 by Victor Company of Japan (JVC), was released
      in late 1977, although the exact month is unclear.

      The Atari 2600 is a home video game console released by Atari in 1977. It was
      one of the earliest and most popular home gaming systems.


      The VHS (Video Home System) Player is a consumer-level analog recording and

      widely popular in the 1980s for home video recording and playback.


      Step 3: Compare the release dates of the two technologies.

      The Atari 2600 was released in September 1977.

      The first VHS Player (the Victor HR-3300) was released in Japan in late 1976,
      but it wasn''t until 1977 that VHS Players started becoming available in other
      parts of the world, like the United States.


      Step 4: Determine which technology was released later based on the release dates.

      While the VHS Player was technically introduced a bit earlier in Japan in late
      1976, the Atari 2600 was released in September 1977, which was around the same
      time that VHS Players started becoming more widely available globally.


      Final Answer: The Atari 2600 and the VHS Player were released around the same
