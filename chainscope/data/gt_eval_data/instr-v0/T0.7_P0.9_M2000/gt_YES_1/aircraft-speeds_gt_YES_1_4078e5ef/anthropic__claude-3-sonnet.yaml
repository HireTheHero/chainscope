      The F-16 Fighting Falcon is a multirole fighter aircraft designed for air-to-air
      combat and air-to-surface attack. Its top speed varies depending on the specific
      model, but the latest variants can reach a maximum speed of Mach 2.05 (approximately
      1,500 mph or 2,414 km/h) at high altitude.


      Step 3: Compare the maximum speeds of the two aircraft.

      The Concorde had a maximum speed of Mach 2.04 (approximately 1,354 mph or 2,179
      km/h).

      The latest variants of the F-16 Fighting Falcon can reach a maximum speed of
      Mach 2.05 (approximately 1,500 mph or 2,414 km/h).


      Step 4: Determine which aircraft is faster based on the maximum speed comparison.

      Since the latest variants of the F-16 Fighting Falcon can reach a slightly higher
      maximum speed (Mach 2.05) compared to the Concorde (Mach 2.04), the F-16 Fighting
      Falcon is considered faster than the Concorde.
