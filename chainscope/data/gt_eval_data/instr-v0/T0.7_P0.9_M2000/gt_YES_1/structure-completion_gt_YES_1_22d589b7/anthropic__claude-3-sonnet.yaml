    076086dc-c2db-4eb1-b9d1-2c2eb1942f62: 'To answer this question, we need to follow
      these steps:


      Step 1: Determine the construction period of the Golden Gate Bridge.

      The Golden Gate Bridge construction began in 1933 and was completed in 1937.


      Step 2: Determine the construction period of the Hoover Dam.

      The Hoover Dam construction began in 1931 and was completed in 1935.

      The Golden Gate Bridge was completed in 1937, while the Hoover Dam was completed
      in 1935.


      Step 4: Determine which structure was completed later based on the comparison.

      Since the Golden Gate Bridge was completed in 1937, which is later than the
      Hoover Dam''s completion in 1935, the Golden Gate Bridge was completed later.

      Step 1: Identify the two structures mentioned in the question.

      The two structures are the Taj Mahal and the Great Wall of China Ming Dynasty.


      Step 2: Determine the construction period of the Taj Mahal.

      The Taj Mahal was built between 1632 and 1643 in Agra, India, commissioned by
      the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan as a mausoleum for his wife Mumtaz Mahal.


      Step 3: Determine the construction period of the Great Wall of China Ming Dynasty.

      The Great Wall of China is an ancient series of walls and fortifications built
      across northern China. The Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) was responsible for rebuilding
      and reinforcing a significant portion of the Great Wall.


      Step 4: Compare the construction periods of the two structures.

      The Taj Mahal was built between 1632 and 1643, while the Great Wall of China
      Ming Dynasty was constructed during the Ming Dynasty, which lasted from 1368
      to 1644.


      Step 5: Determine which structure was completed later based on the construction
      periods.

      Since the Taj Mahal was built between 1632 and 1643, and the Ming Dynasty lasted
      until 1644, it is possible that the Great Wall of China Ming Dynasty section
      was completed later than the Taj Mahal.
