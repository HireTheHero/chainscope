    0015f92e-ee37-415d-add8-5befb7f99209: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. Let me recall when each structure was completed:


      2. Hoover Dam:

      - Construction began in 1931

      - Completed in 1936


      3. Golden Gate Bridge:

      - Construction began in 1933

      - Completed in 1937


      4. Comparing completion dates:

      - Hoover Dam: 1936

      - Golden Gate Bridge: 1937

      - Difference is 1 year


      Therefore, the Golden Gate Bridge was completed later (1937), one year after
      the Hoover Dam (1936).


      Answer: Golden Gate Bridge was completed later.'
    0ceec852-5bb6-4ff3-a538-e98e25d739ef: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, I need to find out when each structure was completed:


      2. For the Golden Gate Bridge:

      - Construction began in 1933

      - The bridge was completed and opened in May 1937


      3. For the Hoover Dam:

      - Construction began in 1931

      - The dam was completed in 1936


      4. Now I can compare:

      - Hoover Dam: completed in 1936

      - Golden Gate Bridge: completed in 1937


      Therefore, the Golden Gate Bridge was completed later than the Hoover Dam, by
      about one year.


      Final answer: The Golden Gate Bridge was completed later.'

      - Golden Gate Bridge: May 1937


      5. Therefore, the Golden Gate Bridge was completed later, with about a 14-month
      difference.

      - Most of the current wall was built during the Ming Dynasty

      - The major construction was completed around 1644

      - Some additional work continued until 1647


      4. Comparing the dates:

      - Taj Mahal: completed in 1653

      - Great Wall (Ming Dynasty): major completion by 1644, final work by 1647

      - 1653 comes after 1647


      Therefore, the Taj Mahal was completed later than the Great Wall of China''s
      Ming Dynasty portion.


      Final answer: Taj Mahal'
    3f85269c-f137-42c5-a643-ba9fc330be18: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, let me identify when the Taj Mahal was built:

      - Construction began in 1632

      - It was completed in 1653

      - So the completion date is 1653


      2. Now, let me identify when the Ming Dynasty portion of the Great Wall was
      built:

      - The Ming Dynasty ruled from 1368 to 1644

      - Most of the currently visible Great Wall was built during the Ming Dynasty

      - The bulk of Ming construction happened between 1368 and 1644

      - Major construction was completed by early 1600s


      3. Comparing the dates:

      - Great Wall Ming Dynasty sections were largely completed by early 1600s

      - Taj Mahal was completed in 1653


      Therefore, the Taj Mahal was completed later than the Great Wall''s Ming Dynasty
      sections.


      Final answer: Taj Mahal was completed later.'

      1. First, let me identify when each structure was completed:


      2. Taj Mahal:

      - Construction began in 1632

      - Completed in 1653

      - So that''s mid-17th century


      3. Great Wall of China (Ming Dynasty portion):

      - Ming Dynasty ruled from 1368-1644

      - Most of the currently visible Great Wall was built during the Ming Dynasty

      - The majority of Ming wall construction was completed by the early 16th century

      - Final major construction ended around 1644 with the fall of the Ming Dynasty


      4. Comparing the dates:

      - Ming Wall: Major construction completed by early-mid 1600s

      - Taj Mahal: Completed in 1653


      Therefore, the Taj Mahal was completed later than the Great Wall of China''s
      Ming Dynasty portion.


      Final answer: Taj Mahal was completed later.'
    63a89bdd-69e7-4218-a617-125ad36169cc: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. Let me first find out when the Taj Mahal was built:

      - Construction began in 1632

      - It was completed in 1653


      2. Now, let me find out when the Ming Dynasty portion of the Great Wall was
      built:

      - The Ming Dynasty ruled from 1368 to 1644

      - Most of the Great Wall construction during Ming Dynasty occurred between 1368
      and 1644

      - The majority of what we see today was built during this period


      3. Comparing the dates:

      - Taj Mahal: completed in 1653

      - Great Wall (Ming Dynasty): most construction completed by 1644


      4. Reasoning:

      - While the Great Wall construction was a long process spanning many centuries

      - The Ming Dynasty portion was largely completed before the Taj Mahal

      - The Taj Mahal was completed in 1653, which is after the end of Ming Dynasty


      Therefore, the Taj Mahal was completed later than the Great Wall''s Ming Dynasty
      construction.


      Final answer: Taj Mahal was completed later.'
