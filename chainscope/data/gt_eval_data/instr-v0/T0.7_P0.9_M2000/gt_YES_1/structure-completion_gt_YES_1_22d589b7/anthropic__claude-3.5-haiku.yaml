      1. Empire State Building:

      - Located in New York City

      - Construction began in March 1930

      - Completed in May 1931

      - Total construction time: About 1 year and 2 months


      2. Panama Canal:

      - Located in Panama, connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans

      - Construction began by the United States in 1904

      - Completed in 1914

      - Total construction time: About 10 years


      3. Comparing completion dates:

      - Empire State Building was completed in 1931

      - Panama Canal was completed in 1914


      4. Determining which was completed later:

      - 1931 is later than 1914
