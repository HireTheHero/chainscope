      later, the Golden Gate Bridge or the Hoover Dam, we need to go through the following
      steps:


      Step 1: Identify the completion dates of the two structures.

      - The Golden Gate Bridge was completed in 1937.

      - The Hoover Dam was completed in 1935.


      Step 2: Compare the completion dates.

      - The Hoover Dam was completed in 1935, while the Golden Gate Bridge was completed
      in 1937.


      Step 3: Determine which structure was completed later.

      - Based on the completion dates, the Golden Gate Bridge was completed later
      than the Hoover Dam.


      Final answer:

      The structure that was completed later is the Golden Gate Bridge.'
    3488feb4-efdd-4ebd-bd75-8530f59bbc41: 'To determine which structure was completed
      later, the Golden Gate Bridge or the Hoover Dam, let''s go through the steps
      of reasoning:


      Step 1: Identify the completion dates of the two structures.

      - Golden Gate Bridge: The Golden Gate Bridge was completed and opened to the
      public on May 27, 1937.

      - Hoover Dam: The Hoover Dam was completed and dedicated on March 1, 1936.


      Step 2: Compare the completion dates.

      By comparing the completion dates, we can see that the Hoover Dam was completed
      earlier than the Golden Gate Bridge.


      Step 3: Determine which structure was completed later.

      Since the Hoover Dam was completed in 1936, and the Golden Gate Bridge was completed
      in 1937, the Golden Gate Bridge was completed later.


      Final answer:

      The structure that was completed later is the Golden Gate Bridge.'
