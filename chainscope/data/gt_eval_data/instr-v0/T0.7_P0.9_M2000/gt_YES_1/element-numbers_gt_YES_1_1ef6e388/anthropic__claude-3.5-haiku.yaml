      \ higher up in the periodic table\n   - Its atomic number is 47\n\n4. Compare\
      \ the atomic numbers:\n   - Gold (Au): 79 protons\n   - Silver (Ag): 47 protons\n\
      \   - 79 is greater than 47\n\n5. Therefore, gold has a higher atomic number\
      \ than silver.\n\nFinal answer: Gold has a higher atomic number."
