      1. First, let me recall the heights of both mountains:

      - Mount Everest is 8,848 meters (29,029 feet) above sea level

      - K2 is 8,611 meters (28,251 feet) above sea level


      2. Now I can directly compare these numbers:

      - 8,848 m > 8,611 m

      - The difference is 237 meters


      Therefore, Mount Everest is higher than K2. In fact, Mount Everest is the highest
      mountain on Earth, while K2 is the second highest.


      Final answer: Mount Everest is higher than K2.'

      - The difference is 778 feet, with Everest being taller


      3. Double-checking my memory against known facts:

      2. To compare them directly:

      - Denali: 20,310 feet

      - Kilimanjaro: 19,341 feet

      - The difference is about 969 feet


      3. Converting to metric for verification:

      - Denali: 6,190 meters

      - Kilimanjaro: 5,895 meters

      - The difference is about 295 meters


      Final answer: Mount Denali is higher than Mount Kilimanjaro.'
    f38b057b-4217-4179-bf98-c932df118d19: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, let me recall the heights of both mountains:

      - Mount Denali (formerly known as Mount McKinley) is approximately 20,310 feet
      (6,190 meters)

      - Mount Kilimanjaro is approximately 19,341 feet (5,895 meters)


      2. To compare them directly:

      - Denali: 20,310 feet

      - Kilimanjaro: 19,341 feet

      - Difference: 20,310 - 19,341 = 969 feet


      3. Converting to meters to verify:

      - Denali: 6,190 meters

      - Kilimanjaro: 5,895 meters

      - Difference: 6,190 - 5,895 = 295 meters


      Final answer: Mount Denali is higher than Mount Kilimanjaro by about 969 feet
      (295 meters).'
