      2. Mount K2, also known as Chhogori or Qogir, is located on the China-Pakistan
      border in the Karakoram mountain range. It is the second-highest mountain in
      the world, with an elevation of 8,611 meters (28,251 feet) above sea level.


      3. Mount Kangchenjunga is located on the border between Nepal and India in the
      Himalayas. It is the third-highest mountain in the world, with an elevation
      of 8,586 meters (28,169 feet) above sea level.


      4. Comparing the heights, we can see that Mount K2 is 8,611 meters tall, while
      Mount Kangchenjunga is 8,586 meters tall.


      5. Therefore, Mount K2 is 25 meters (82 feet) higher than Mount Kangchenjunga.
