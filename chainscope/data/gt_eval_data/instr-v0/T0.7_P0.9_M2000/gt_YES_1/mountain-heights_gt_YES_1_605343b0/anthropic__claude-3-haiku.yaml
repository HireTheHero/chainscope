      1. Mount Everest and Mount K2 are both major mountain peaks.


      2. To determine which one is higher, we need to compare their elevations or
      heights above sea level.


      3. Mount Everest is located in the Himalayas on the border of Nepal and Tibet
      (China). Its elevation is 29,032 feet (8,848 meters) above sea level.


      4. Mount K2 is located in the Karakoram mountain range on the border of Pakistan
      and China. Its elevation is 28,251 feet (8,611 meters) above sea level.


      5. Comparing the elevations, we can see that Mount Everest, at 29,032 feet,
      is higher than Mount K2, which is 28,251 feet.


      Therefore, the answer is:

      Mount Everest is higher than Mount K2.'
