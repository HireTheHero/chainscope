      step:


      Step 1: Identify the two mountains in question.

      The mountains mentioned are Mount Everest and Mount K2.


      Step 2: Recall the basic information about these mountains.

      Mount Everest is located in the Himalayas, on the border between Nepal and China
      (Tibet Autonomous Region). It is widely recognized as the highest mountain in
      the world.

      Mount K2, also known as Chhogori or Godwin-Austen, is the second-highest mountain
      in the world, located on the Pakistan-China border in the Karakoram range.


      Step 3: Compare the elevations of the two mountains.

      According to the latest measurements:

      - Mount Everest has an elevation of 8,849 meters (29,032 feet) above sea level.

      - Mount K2 has an elevation of 8,611 meters (28,251 feet) above sea level.


      Step 4: Determine which mountain is higher based on the elevations.

      Since Mount Everest has a higher elevation of 8,849 meters compared to Mount
      K2''s 8,611 meters, it is evident that Mount Everest is higher than Mount K2.


      Final Answer: Mount Everest is higher than Mount K2.'

      - The elevation of Mount K2 is approximately 8,611 meters (28,251 feet) above
      sea level.

      elevation of 8,611 meters, it is clear that Mount Everest is higher than Mount
      K2.
