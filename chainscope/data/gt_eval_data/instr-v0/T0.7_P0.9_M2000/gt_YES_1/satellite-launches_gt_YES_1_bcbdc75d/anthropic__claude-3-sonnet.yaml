      Step 1: Identify the satellites mentioned in the question.

      The two satellites mentioned are Early Bird and Syncom 3.


      Step 2: Gather information about the launch dates of these satellites.

      Early Bird (also known as Intelsat 1) was launched on April 6, 1965. It was
      the first commercial communications satellite to be placed in geosynchronous
      orbit.


      Syncom 3 was launched on August 19, 1964. It was an experimental communications
      satellite launched by NASA and was the first geosynchronous satellite.
