      - Tower Bridge in London is 244 meters (800 ft) long


      3. Now I can compare:

      - Sydney Harbour Bridge: 1,149 meters

      - Tower Bridge: 244 meters

      - 1,149 is clearly greater than 244


      Therefore, Sydney Harbour Bridge is longer than Tower Bridge - and by quite

      1. First, I need to recall the lengths of both bridges:


      * Lake Pontchartrain Causeway (Louisiana, USA) is 23.83 miles (38.35 km) long

      * Confederation Bridge (connects Prince Edward Island to New Brunswick, Canada)
      is 8 miles (12.9 km) long


      2. Converting both to the same unit to compare directly:

      * Lake Pontchartrain Causeway: 23.83 miles

      * Confederation Bridge: 8 miles


      3. Comparing the numbers:

      23.83 > 8


      Therefore, Lake Pontchartrain Causeway is longer than Confederation Bridge.
