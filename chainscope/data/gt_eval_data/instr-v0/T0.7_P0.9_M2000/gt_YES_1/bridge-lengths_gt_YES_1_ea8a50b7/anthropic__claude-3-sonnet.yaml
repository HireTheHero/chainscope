      The Chesapeake Bay Bridge spans the Chesapeake Bay, which is a large body of
      water separating the Delmarva Peninsula from the rest of Maryland. It is a crucial
      link for transportation in the region, connecting the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan
      area with the Eastern Shore of Maryland and Delaware.


      The Sunshine Skyway Bridge crosses Tampa Bay in Florida, connecting St. Petersburg
      and Terra Ceia. While Tampa Bay is a significant body of water, it is generally
      smaller in size compared to the Chesapeake Bay.


      Based on the relative sizes of the bodies of water they span and the importance
      of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge as a major transportation link, it is reasonable

      - Confederation Bridge is a 12.9 km (8 mi) long bridge that connects Prince
      Edward Island with mainland New Brunswick, Canada.

      - Seven Mile Bridge is a 6.79 mi (10.9 km) long bridge in the Florida Keys,
      connecting Knight''s Key to Little Duck Key in Monroe County, Florida, United
      States.


      Step 3: Convert the lengths to the same unit for easier comparison.

      - Confederation Bridge: 12.9 km or 8 mi

      - Seven Mile Bridge: 10.9 km or 6.79 mi

      Brooklyn Bridge, is longer in length.


      Step 2: Gather relevant information.

      The Manhattan Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the East River, connecting
      Manhattan and Brooklyn in New York City. The Brooklyn Bridge is also a suspension
      bridge that crosses the East River, connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn.


      Step 3: Compare the lengths of the two bridges.

      According to the available information:

      - The Manhattan Bridge has a total length of 2,089 meters (1.3 miles or 6,855
      feet).

      - The Brooklyn Bridge has a total length of 1,834 meters (1.14 miles or 6,016
      feet).


      Step 4: Analyze the comparison.

      By comparing the lengths, it is evident that the Manhattan Bridge, with a total
      length of 2,089 meters, is longer than the Brooklyn Bridge, which has a total
      length of 1,834 meters.

      - Main span length: 1,595.5 feet (486.3 meters)


      George Washington Bridge:

      - Opened in 1931

      - Connects Manhattan in New York City to Fort Lee, New Jersey

      - Total length: 4,760 feet (1,450 meters)

      The George Washington Bridge has a total length of 4,760 feet (1,450 meters),
      while the main span of the Brooklyn Bridge is 1,595.5 feet (486.3 meters).


      Step 4: Determine which bridge is longer based on the comparison.

      Since the total length of the George Washington Bridge (4,760 feet) is significantly
      longer than the main span length of the Brooklyn Bridge (1,595.5 feet), it is
      evident that the George Washington Bridge is the longer of the two bridges.

      a step-by-step reasoning process:


      Step 1: Identify the two bridges mentioned in the question.

      The bridges mentioned are the Brooklyn Bridge and the George Washington Bridge.


      Step 2: Recall any prior knowledge about the lengths of these bridges.

      I don''t have specific lengths memorized for these bridges, but I know they
      are both major suspension bridges spanning waterways in the New York City area.


      Step 3: Consider the locations and purposes of the bridges.

      The Brooklyn Bridge connects the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn, spanning
      the East River.

      The George Washington Bridge connects New Jersey and Manhattan, spanning the
      Hudson River.


      Step 4: Analyze the potential factors that could influence the length of each
      bridge.

      Factors like the width of the waterway being crossed, the height required for
      ship clearance, and the terrain on either side could impact the length of the
      bridges.


      Step 5: Make a reasonable assumption or conclusion based on the available information.

      Given that the Hudson River is generally wider than the East River, and the
      George Washington Bridge connects two separate states (New Jersey and New York),
      it is reasonable to assume that the George Washington Bridge is likely longer
      than the Brooklyn Bridge.

      Step 4: Analyze the information and determine the longer bridge.

      Based on the information gathered, the George Washington Bridge has a longer
      main span length of 3,500 feet compared to the Brooklyn Bridge''s main span
      length of 1,595.5 feet. However, when considering the total length, the Brooklyn
