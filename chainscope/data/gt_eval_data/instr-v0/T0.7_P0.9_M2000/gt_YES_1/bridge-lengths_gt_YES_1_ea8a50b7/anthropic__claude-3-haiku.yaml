      1. The Sunshine Skyway Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the mouth of
      Tampa Bay in Florida, connecting the Manatee County peninsula with the Pinellas
      County peninsula.


      2. The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Golden Gate
      strait, the one-mile-wide (1.6 km) channel between the Pacific Ocean and San
      Francisco Bay.


      3. To determine which bridge is longer, we need to compare the main span lengths
      of the two bridges.


      4. The main span of the Sunshine Skyway Bridge is 1,200 feet (366 meters).


      5. The main span of the Golden Gate Bridge is 4,200 feet (1,280 meters).


      6. Comparing the main span lengths, the Golden Gate Bridge, with a main span
      of 4,200 feet, is significantly longer than the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, which
      has a main span of 1,200 feet.


      Therefore, the answer is: The Golden Gate Bridge is longer than the Sunshine
      Skyway Bridge.'

    defce899-639a-4b99-aab5-2c08b5d4c355: 'Okay, let''s think this through step-by-step:


      Step 1: Gather information about the two bridges.

      - Sunshine Skyway Bridge is a suspension bridge located in Florida, USA.

      - Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge located in California, USA.


      Step 2: Compare the key dimensions of the two bridges.

      - Sunshine Skyway Bridge has a main span length of 1,200 meters (3,900 feet).

      - Golden Gate Bridge has a main span length of 1,280 meters (4,200 feet).


      Step 3: Analyze the information and compare the lengths.

      By comparing the main span lengths, we can see that the Golden Gate Bridge,
      with a main span of 1,280 meters, is longer than the Sunshine Skyway Bridge,
      which has a main span of 1,200 meters.


      Final answer: The Golden Gate Bridge is longer than the Sunshine Skyway Bridge.'
