      the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, let''s break
      down the problem into steps:


      Step 1: Research the length of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge.

      The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge consists of two sections:

      - The western span, connecting San Francisco to Yerba Buena Island, is 10,304
      feet (3,141 meters) long.

      - The eastern span, connecting Yerba Buena Island to Oakland, is 10,176 feet
      (3,102 meters) long.

      In total, the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge is approximately 20,480 feet
      (6,243 meters) long.


      Step 2: Research the length of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.

      The Chesapeake Bay Bridge, located in Maryland, is actually two separate bridges:

      - The eastbound bridge, opened in 1952, is 4.3 miles (6.9 kilometers) long.

      - The westbound bridge, opened in 1973, is also 4.3 miles (6.9 kilometers) long.

      Each bridge is approximately 22,790 feet (6,946 meters) long.


      Step 3: Compare the lengths of the two bridges.

      The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge is approximately 20,480 feet (6,243 meters)
      long, while each of the two bridges that make up the Chesapeake Bay Bridge is
      about 22,790 feet (6,946 meters) long.


      Final Answer:

      The Chesapeake Bay Bridge is longer than the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge.
      Each of the two bridges that make up the Chesapeake Bay Bridge is approximately
      2,310 feet (703 meters) longer than the entire length of the San Francisco-Oakland
      Bay Bridge.'

      - The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge is located in California, connecting
      San Francisco to Oakland across the San Francisco Bay.

      - The Chesapeake Bay Bridge is located in Maryland, spanning the Chesapeake
      Bay and connecting the state''s Eastern and Western Shore regions.


      Step 2: Research the lengths of each bridge.

      - The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge is a complex of bridges with a total
      length of 8.4 miles (13.5 km).

      - The Chesapeake Bay Bridge, also known as the Governor William Preston Lane
      Jr. Memorial Bridge, has a total length of 4.3 miles (6.9 km).


      Step 3: Compare the lengths of the two bridges.

      - The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge is 8.4 miles long, while the Chesapeake
      Bay Bridge is 4.3 miles long.

      - 8.4 miles is greater than 4.3 miles.

      to Little Duck Key.

      - Mackinac Bridge is located in Michigan, connecting the Upper and Lower Peninsulas
      of the state.


      Step 2: Consider the name "Seven Mile Bridge" and its implications.

      - The name suggests that the bridge is approximately seven miles long.

      - However, names can be misleading, so we should not rely solely on this information.


      Step 3: Research the actual lengths of both bridges.

      - Seven Mile Bridge: According to the Florida Keys website, the total length
      of the Seven Mile Bridge is 6.79 miles (10.93 km), with the longest segmental
      bridge spanning 2.16 miles (3.48 km).

      Both bridges are located in New York City and span the East River, connecting
      the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn.


      Step 2: Research the lengths of the bridges

      Manhattan Bridge:

      - Total length: 6,855 feet (2,089 meters)
