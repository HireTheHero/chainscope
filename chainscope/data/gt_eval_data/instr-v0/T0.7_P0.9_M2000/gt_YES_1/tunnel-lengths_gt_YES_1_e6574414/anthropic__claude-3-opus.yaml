      Sydney Harbour. It connects the northern part of the city with the central business
      district.


      2. The Queens-Midtown Tunnel is a tunnel in New York City, USA. It runs under
      the East River and connects the boroughs of Queens and Manhattan.


      3. To determine which tunnel is longer, we would need to know the exact lengths
      of each tunnel.


      4. Without knowing the exact lengths, we can make an educated guess based on
      the geography each tunnel traverses. The Sydney Harbour Tunnel crosses a harbor,
      while the Queens-Midtown Tunnel crosses a river. Generally, harbors are wider
      than rivers.


      5. Based on this, we could assume that the Sydney Harbour Tunnel is likely to
      be longer, as it needs to span a wider body of water.


      Final answer: Without definite lengths, and based on the reasoning that harbors
      are typically wider than rivers, the Sydney Harbour Tunnel is likely to be longer
      than the Queens-Midtown Tunnel. However, to be certain, we would need to check
      the actual lengths of each tunnel.'

      2. The Queens-Midtown Tunnel is a tunnel in New York City, United States. It
      runs under the East River and connects the boroughs of Manhattan (at Midtown)
      and Queens.


      3. To compare the lengths, we would need to know the exact length of each tunnel.
      Without that information, we can try to reason based on the geography and purpose
      of each tunnel.


      4. Sydney Harbour is a large natural harbor. The tunnel needs to go under this
      wide body of water, which would likely require a significant length to cross
      underneath safely.


      5. The East River in New York City, while still substantial, is a narrower body
      of water compared to Sydney Harbour. The tunnel connects two parts of the city,
      so it''s designed for urban transportation.


      6. Considering these factors, it''s reasonable to assume that the Sydney Harbour
      Tunnel, which crosses a wider body of water, is likely to be longer than the
      Queens-Midtown Tunnel, which is an urban tunnel under a narrower river.


      Final answer: Based on the reasoning above, the Sydney Harbour Tunnel is likely

      - Eisenhower Tunnel: This tunnel is located in Colorado, USA, on Interstate
      70, crossing the Continental Divide in the Rocky Mountains.


      Step 2: Determine the type of each tunnel.

      - Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line: It is a road tunnel that consists of a bridge-tunnel
      combination. The tunnel portion is undersea.

      - Eisenhower Tunnel: It is a mountain tunnel that carries Interstate 70 under

      Step 1: Mont Blanc Tunnel

      - The Mont Blanc Tunnel is a highway tunnel connecting France and Italy beneath
      the Mont Blanc mountain range in the Alps.

      - It is approximately 11.6 kilometers (7.2 miles) long.


      Step 2: Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line

      - The Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line is a combination of bridge and tunnel crossing Tokyo
      Bay in Japan.

      - The total length of the Aqua-Line is about 14 kilometers (8.7 miles), but
      this includes both the tunnel and bridge sections.

      - The tunnel section, known as the Trans-Tokyo Bay Tunnel, is approximately
      9.6 kilometers (6.0 miles) long.


      Step 3: Comparison

      - The Mont Blanc Tunnel has a length of 11.6 kilometers (7.2 miles).

      - The tunnel section of the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line, the Trans-Tokyo Bay Tunnel,
      has a length of 9.6 kilometers (6.0 miles).

      the Mont Blanc mountain.

      - The Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line is a bridge-tunnel combination across Tokyo Bay in
      Japan, connecting the cities of Kawasaki and Kisarazu.


      Step 2: Research the lengths of the tunnels

      - The Mont Blanc Tunnel is approximately 11.6 kilometers (7.2 miles) long.

      - The Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line has an overall length of 14 kilometers (8.7 miles),
      but only a portion of it is a tunnel. The tunnel section, known as the Trans-Tokyo
      Bay Highway, is 9.6 kilometers (6.0 miles) long.


      Step 3: Compare the tunnel lengths

      - The Mont Blanc Tunnel is 11.6 kilometers long.

      - The tunnel section of the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line is 9.6 kilometers long.

      - 11.6 kilometers > 9.6 kilometers


      Final answer: The Mont Blanc Tunnel is longer than the tunnel section of the

    778ff56b-5df6-4031-80a3-14aee8174173: 'To determine which tunnel is longer, let''s
      think through this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of the tunnels.

      - The Lincoln Tunnel connects New York City and New Jersey, USA, passing under
      the Hudson River.

      - The Sydney Harbour Tunnel connects the northern and southern shores of Sydney
      Harbour in Sydney, Australia.


      Step 2: Understand the purpose of the tunnels.

      - Both tunnels are used for vehicular traffic to cross a body of water.


      Step 3: Research the lengths of the tunnels.

      - The Lincoln Tunnel is approximately 1.5 miles (2.4 km) long.

      - The Sydney Harbour Tunnel is approximately 1.4 miles (2.2 km) long.


      Step 4: Compare the lengths of the tunnels.

      - The Lincoln Tunnel is slightly longer than the Sydney Harbour Tunnel by about
      0.1 miles (0.2 km).


      Final Answer: The Lincoln Tunnel is longer than the Sydney Harbour Tunnel.'

    f5e66990-cb69-432b-b1ce-b42fcadb4b43: 'To determine which tunnel is longer, let''s
      follow these steps:


      Step 1: Research the length of the Lincoln Tunnel.

      The Lincoln Tunnel, which connects New York City to New Jersey under the Hudson
      River, consists of three tubes. According to the Port Authority of New York
      and New Jersey, the total length of the Lincoln Tunnel is approximately 1.5
      miles (2.4 km).


      Step 2: Research the length of the Sydney Harbour Tunnel.

      The Sydney Harbour Tunnel, located in Sydney, Australia, runs under Sydney Harbour
      and connects the central business district with the North Shore. According to
      the official Sydney Harbour Tunnel website, the tunnel is 2.3 km (1.4 miles)
      long.


      Step 3: Compare the lengths of the two tunnels.

      Lincoln Tunnel: 1.5 miles (2.4 km)

      Sydney Harbour Tunnel: 1.4 miles (2.3 km)


      Final Answer:

      Based on the information gathered, the Lincoln Tunnel is slightly longer than
      the Sydney Harbour Tunnel. The Lincoln Tunnel measures approximately 1.5 miles
      (2.4 km), while the Sydney Harbour Tunnel is about 1.4 miles (2.3 km) long.'
