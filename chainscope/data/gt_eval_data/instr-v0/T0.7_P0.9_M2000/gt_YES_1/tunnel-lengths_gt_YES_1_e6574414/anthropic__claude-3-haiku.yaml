      Step 1: Gather information about the two tunnels.

      - The Holland Tunnel is a vehicular tunnel that connects New Jersey and Manhattan,
      New York.

      - The Lincoln Tunnel is also a vehicular tunnel that connects New Jersey and
      Manhattan, New York.


      Step 2: Compare the lengths of the two tunnels.

      - The Holland Tunnel has a total length of approximately 8,558 meters (5.32
      miles).

      - The Lincoln Tunnel has a total length of approximately 2,697 meters (1.67
      miles).


      Step 3: Analyze the information and determine the longer tunnel.

      - Based on the given information, the Holland Tunnel is significantly longer
      than the Lincoln Tunnel, with a length of approximately 8,558 meters (5.32 miles)
      compared to the Lincoln Tunnel''s length of approximately 2,697 meters (1.67
      miles).


      Final answer:

      The Holland Tunnel is longer than the Lincoln Tunnel.'

      1. The Holland Tunnel and the Lincoln Tunnel are both major road tunnels that
      connect New Jersey and New York City.


      2. To determine which tunnel is longer, we need to compare the lengths of the
      two tunnels.


      3. The Holland Tunnel is a set of two parallel tunnels, one for northbound traffic
      and one for southbound traffic. The total length of the Holland Tunnel is approximately
      8,558 feet (2,607 meters).


      4. The Lincoln Tunnel is also a set of three parallel tunnels, with the middle
      tunnel being the longest. The total length of the Lincoln Tunnel is approximately

      Step 2: Compare the lengths of the two tunnels.

      - The Mont Blanc Tunnel is 11.6 km (7.2 miles) long.

      - The Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line has a total length of 15.1 km (9.4 miles), with the
      tunnel portion being 9.6 km (6 miles) long.

      - Comparing the lengths, the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line, with a total length of 15.1
      km, is longer than the Mont Blanc Tunnel, which is 11.6 km long.

      - However, if we compare only the tunnel portions, the Mont Blanc Tunnel at

    d38a9b04-f9c0-4b74-8859-da31584f456e: 'Okay, let''s think this through step-by-step:


      Step 1: Gather information about the two tunnels.

      - The Lincoln Tunnel is a road tunnel that connects Weehawken, New Jersey to
      Midtown Manhattan in New York City.

      - The Sydney Harbour Tunnel is a road tunnel that connects the northern and
      southern shores of Sydney Harbour in Australia.


      Step 2: Compare the lengths of the two tunnels.

      - The Lincoln Tunnel is approximately 1.5 miles (2.4 km) long.

      - The Sydney Harbour Tunnel is approximately 2.3 miles (3.7 km) long.


      Step 3: Determine which tunnel is longer.

      Based on the information gathered, the Sydney Harbour Tunnel, at 2.3 miles (3.7
      km) long, is longer than the Lincoln Tunnel, which is 1.5 miles (2.4 km) long.


      Therefore, the answer is:

      The Sydney Harbour Tunnel is longer than the Lincoln Tunnel.'
