      1. First, let me recall the lengths of both tunnels:

      - Sydney Harbour Tunnel (Australia) is approximately 2.3 kilometers (1.4 miles)
      long

      - Queens-Midtown Tunnel (New York City) is approximately 1.955 kilometers (1.2
      miles) long


      2. Converting both to the same unit for direct comparison:

      - Sydney Harbour Tunnel: 2.3 km

      - Queens-Midtown Tunnel: 1.955 km


      3. Comparing the numbers:

      2.3 km > 1.955 km


      Therefore, the Sydney Harbour Tunnel is longer than the Queens-Midtown Tunnel.


      Final answer: Sydney Harbour Tunnel is longer.'

      Answer: The Seikan Tunnel is longer.'
    828d5014-586e-409c-8ebe-3758c6abb20c: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) First, let me recall the facts about both tunnels:

      - The Seikan Tunnel connects the Japanese islands of Honshu and Hokkaido

      - The Channel Tunnel (Chunnel) connects the UK and France

      - The Chunnel actually consists of three parallel tunnels: two rail tunnels
      and one service tunnel


      2) Let me find their lengths:

      - Seikan Tunnel is 53.85 km (33.46 miles) in total length

      - The Chunnel Service Tunnel is 50.45 km (31.35 miles) long


      3) Now I can compare:

      53.85 km > 50.45 km


      Therefore, the Seikan Tunnel is longer than the Chunnel Service Tunnel by about
      3.4 km.

      3. Comparing the tunnels:

      - Mont Blanc Tunnel: 11.6 km

    270cc7e8-d7ab-444a-89e9-7a92a18f5057: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, let me recall the lengths of both tunnels:

      - Mont Blanc Tunnel connects France and Italy under the Mont Blanc mountain

      - Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line is a combination of bridge and tunnel crossing Tokyo Bay

      - The tunnel portion is about 9.6 km long, but the total length including the
      bridge is 14 km


      2. Let''s consider what we''re comparing:

      - The question asks specifically about tunnels

      - So we should compare just the tunnel portions, not the total length of the
      Aqua-Line


      3. Comparing the tunnel lengths:

      - Mont Blanc Tunnel: 11.6 km

      - Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line tunnel portion: 9.6 km

      2. Now, let me recall details about Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line:

      - It connects Kawasaki and Kisarazu across Tokyo Bay

      - It''s a combination of bridge and tunnel

      - The tunnel portion (Trans-Tokyo Bay tunnel) is 9.6 km

      3. Let''s compare:

      - Mont Blanc Tunnel: 11.6 km

      - Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line tunnel portion: 9.6 km


      4. Reasoning:

      While the total Aqua-Line is longer at 14 km, we need to compare just the tunnel
      portions. The Mont Blanc Tunnel at 11.6 km is longer than the Aqua-Line''s tunnel
      portion at 9.6 km.

      - (Note: While the total Aqua-Line is longer at 14 km, we must only consider
      its tunnel portion for this comparison)


      3. Comparing the tunnel lengths:

      11.6 km (Mont Blanc) > 9.6 km (Aqua-Line tunnel portion)

      * Mont Blanc Tunnel is 11.6 km long

      * Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line is 14 km in total length, with a 9.6 km undersea tunnel

      3. Comparing:

      * Even if we only count the tunnel portion of the Aqua-Line (9.6 km), not the

      * Mont Blanc Tunnel is still longer at 11.6 km vs 9.6 km

      1. First, let me recall the data about Lincoln Tunnel:

      - Lincoln Tunnel connects New Jersey and Manhattan

      - It runs under the Hudson River

      - Length is approximately 1.5 miles (2.4 km)


      2. Now, about Sydney Harbour Tunnel:

      - Connects northern and southern shores of Sydney Harbour

      - Runs under Sydney Harbour

      - Length is approximately 2.3 km (1.4 miles)


      3. Converting to the same unit to compare:

      - Lincoln Tunnel: 2.4 km

      - Sydney Harbour Tunnel: 2.3 km


      4. Comparing the numbers:

      2.4 km > 2.3 km


      Therefore, Lincoln Tunnel is longer than Sydney Harbour Tunnel, though only
      slightly.'
