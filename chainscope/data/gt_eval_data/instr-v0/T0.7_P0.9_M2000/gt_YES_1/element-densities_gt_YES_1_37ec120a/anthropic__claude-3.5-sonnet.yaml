      \ (K): Atomic number 19, atomic mass \u2248 39.1 u\n\n4) Since both are alkali\

    a58655d2-25ea-4587-89b5-2fd34bb5dc33: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) Density is related to how tightly packed atoms are and how heavy each atom
      is


      2) Both potassium (K) and lithium (Li) are alkali metals from Group 1 of the
      periodic table


      3) Let me check their atomic numbers:

      - Lithium: atomic number 3

      - Potassium: atomic number 19


      4) This means:

      - Lithium has 3 protons

      - Potassium has 19 protons


      5) As they''re in the same group:

      - They have similar chemical properties

      - They have similar crystal structures

      - The main difference will be their atomic mass


      6) Potassium atoms are much heavier than lithium atoms due to more protons and
      neutrons


      7) However, potassium atoms are also much larger than lithium atoms because
      they have more electron shells


      8) The size difference is actually more significant than the mass difference,
      making potassium less tightly packed


      Final Answer: Lithium is denser than potassium. This is because although potassium
      atoms are heavier, they are so much larger that they create a less dense structure

    c07f5162-4a9e-49dc-adb2-cc583c6ae8b5: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) To compare density, I need to recall what density means

      - Density is mass per unit volume

      - Higher density means more mass packed into the same volume


      2) Think about where these elements are on the periodic table

      - Both are metals

      - Aluminum (Al) is in period 3, group 13

      - Magnesium (Mg) is in period 3, group 2


      3) Consider their atomic structure

      - Aluminum has atomic number 13 (more protons and electrons)

      - Magnesium has atomic number 12 (fewer protons and electrons)

      - Both have similar atomic radii since they''re in the same period


      4) Compare their atomic masses

      - Aluminum: 27.0 g/mol

      - Magnesium: 24.3 g/mol


      5) Since they have similar atomic radii but aluminum has greater mass, aluminum
      must pack more mass into roughly the same volume.


      Therefore, aluminum is denser than magnesium.


      Final answer: Aluminum is denser than magnesium.'
