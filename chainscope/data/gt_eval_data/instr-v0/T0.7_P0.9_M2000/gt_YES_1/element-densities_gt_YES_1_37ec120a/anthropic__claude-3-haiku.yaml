      Silver (Ag) has an atomic number of 47, and copper (Cu) has an atomic number

      Step 3: Analyze the relationship between atomic mass and density.

      Generally, the higher the atomic mass of an element, the higher its density.
      This is because the atoms of the element with a higher atomic mass occupy the
      same volume as atoms with a lower atomic mass, resulting in a higher density.

      Since zinc has a higher atomic mass (65.38 g/mol) compared to chromium (51.9961

      \ of silver is 10.49 g/cm\xB3.\n\n5. Since the density of lead (11.34 g/cm\xB3\
      ) is greater than the density of silver (10.49 g/cm\xB3), lead is the denser\
      \ substance.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nLead is denser than silver."
