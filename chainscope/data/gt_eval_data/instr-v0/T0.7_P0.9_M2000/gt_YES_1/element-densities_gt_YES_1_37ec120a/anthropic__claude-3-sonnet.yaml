    466f0b3e-b076-4561-a43d-ecc14beb46ca: 'To determine which substance is denser,
      magnesium or sodium, we need to follow these steps:


      Step 1: Understand the concept of density.

      Density is a measure of how much mass is contained within a given volume of
      a substance. It is calculated by dividing the mass of the substance by its volume.


      Step 2: Compare the atomic masses of magnesium and sodium.

      The atomic mass of an element is a measure of the mass of one atom of that element.
      The higher the atomic mass, the denser the element is likely to be.


      Magnesium has an atomic mass of approximately 24.3 g/mol.

      Sodium has an atomic mass of approximately 23.0 g/mol.


      Since magnesium has a higher atomic mass than sodium, it is likely to be denser.


      Step 3: Compare the atomic radii of magnesium and sodium.

      The atomic radius of an element is a measure of the size of its atoms. The smaller
      the atomic radius, the denser the element is likely to be because the atoms
      can pack more tightly together.


      Magnesium has an atomic radius of approximately 160 picometers (pm).

      Sodium has an atomic radius of approximately 186 pm.


      Since magnesium has a smaller atomic radius than sodium, it is likely to be
      denser.


      Step 4: Consider the crystal structures of magnesium and sodium.

      The crystal structure of a substance can also affect its density. However, in
      this case, the differences in atomic mass and atomic radius are more significant
      factors.


      Final Answer: Based on the higher atomic mass and smaller atomic radius of magnesium
      compared to sodium, magnesium is denser than sodium.'

      Sodium (Na) and potassium (K) are both alkali metals belonging to Group 1 of
      the periodic table. They are highly reactive and have low densities compared
      to most other solid elements.


      Step 2: Compare the atomic masses of sodium and potassium.

      The atomic mass of an element is directly related to its density. Elements with
      higher atomic masses tend to have higher densities.

      - The atomic mass of sodium (Na) is 22.99 u (atomic mass units).

      - The atomic mass of potassium (K) is 39.10 u.


      Step 3: Consider the periodic trends in density.

      Within the same group of the periodic table, the density of elements generally
      increases as you move down the group. This is because the added electron shells
      and nuclear charges result in more tightly bound atoms and a denser packing
      structure.


      Step 4: Combine the information from Steps 2 and 3.

      Since potassium has a higher atomic mass than sodium, and it is located below
      sodium in the same group of the periodic table, we can conclude that potassium
      has a higher density than sodium.


      Final answer: Potassium is denser than sodium.'

      Step 1: Understand the concept of density.

      Density is a measure of how much mass is contained in a given volume of a substance.
      It is calculated by dividing the mass of a substance by its volume.


      Step 2: Identify the atomic masses of sodium and potassium.

      The atomic mass of sodium (Na) is approximately 23 atomic mass units (u).

      The atomic mass of potassium (K) is approximately 39 atomic mass units (u).


      Step 3: Consider the atomic radii of sodium and potassium.

      Sodium has a larger atomic radius compared to potassium, which means that for
      the same mass, sodium atoms occupy a larger volume.


      Step 4: Relate atomic mass and atomic radius to density.

      Since potassium has a higher atomic mass and a smaller atomic radius compared
      to sodium, it is reasonable to expect that potassium atoms are more tightly
      packed, resulting in a higher density.
