      \n1) The boiling point of a metal is related to the strength of its metallic\
      \ bonds\n\n2) Stronger metallic bonds require more energy to break, resulting\
      \ in higher boiling points\n\n3) The strength of metallic bonds is influenced\
      \ by:\n   - Number of valence electrons\n   - Size of the atom\n   - Nuclear\
      \ charge\n\n4) Looking at copper and aluminum:\n   - Copper (Cu): Period 4,\
      \ Group 11, has 1 valence electron but also filled d-orbital\n   - Aluminum\
      \ (Al): Period 3, Group 13, has 3 valence electrons\n\n5) Copper has stronger\
      \ metallic bonds because:\n   - It has d-orbital electrons contributing to bonding\n\
      \   - It has higher nuclear charge\n   - It has more electron density available\
      \ for bonding\n\n6) Checking actual values:\n   - Copper boiling point: 2562\xB0\
      C\n   - Aluminum boiling point: 2470\xB0C\n\nTherefore, copper has the higher\
      \ boiling point."
