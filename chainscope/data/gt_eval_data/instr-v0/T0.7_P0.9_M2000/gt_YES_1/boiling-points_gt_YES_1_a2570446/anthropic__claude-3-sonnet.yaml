    73f1840a-0a9c-47ee-b2d9-9039f8e481b3: 'To determine which substance has a higher
      boiling point between nitrogen and helium, we need to consider the following
      steps:


      Step 1: Understand the nature of the substances.

      Nitrogen (N2) is a diatomic gas, while helium (He) is a monatomic noble gas.


      Step 2: Recall the factors that influence boiling point.

      The boiling point of a substance is primarily determined by the strength of
      the intermolecular forces between its molecules or atoms. Stronger intermolecular
      forces result in a higher boiling point.


      Step 3: Consider the types of intermolecular forces present.

      In the case of nitrogen, the intermolecular forces are van der Waals forces,
      specifically dipole-induced dipole interactions. These forces arise due to the
      asymmetric distribution of electrons in nitrogen molecules, creating temporary
      dipoles.


      In the case of helium, the only intermolecular forces present are very weak
      van der Waals forces called London dispersion forces, which are present between
      all atoms and molecules.


      Step 4: Compare the strengths of the intermolecular forces.

      The dipole-induced dipole interactions in nitrogen are stronger than the London
      dispersion forces in helium. This is because nitrogen molecules have a larger
      electron cloud, which can be more easily distorted, leading to stronger temporary
      dipoles and stronger intermolecular attractions.


      Step 5: Relate the intermolecular forces to the boiling point.

      Substances with stronger intermolecular forces require more energy to overcome
      the attractive forces between their particles, resulting in a higher boiling
      point.


      Final answer: Based on the reasoning above, nitrogen has stronger intermolecular
      forces (dipole-induced dipole interactions) compared to helium (London dispersion
      forces). Therefore, nitrogen has a higher boiling point than helium.'

      The strength of intermolecular forces plays a crucial role in determining the
      boiling point of a substance. Stronger intermolecular forces lead to a higher
      boiling point.


      Step 3: Compare the intermolecular forces.

      Nitrogen molecules can form weak intermolecular forces called van der Waals
      forces, which are dipole-induced dipole interactions. These forces arise due
      to the temporary formation of dipoles in the nitrogen molecules.


      Helium, on the other hand, is a monatomic gas with a completely filled electron
      configuration. As a result, it has minimal intermolecular forces, mainly weak
      London dispersion forces (a type of van der Waals force).


      Step 4: Consider the relative strengths of the intermolecular forces.

      The van der Waals forces in nitrogen are stronger than the London dispersion
      forces in helium because nitrogen molecules have a larger electron cloud, leading
      to stronger temporary dipole interactions.


      Step 5: Relate the intermolecular forces to the boiling point.

      Step 1: Molecular Weight

      Generally, substances with higher molecular weights tend to have higher boiling
      points. This is because larger molecules have stronger intermolecular forces,
      which require more energy to overcome and transition from the liquid to the
      gaseous state.


      The molecular weight of ethanol (C2H6O) is 46.07 g/mol, while the molecular
      weight of methanol (CH4O) is 32.04 g/mol. Since ethanol has a higher molecular
      weight, this factor suggests that ethanol may have a higher boiling point.


      Step 2: Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding

      Polar molecules with the ability to form hydrogen bonds tend to have higher
      boiling points compared to non-polar molecules of similar molecular weight.
      This is because hydrogen bonding creates stronger intermolecular attractions,
      requiring more energy to overcome them during the phase transition from liquid
      to gas.


      Both ethanol and methanol are polar molecules and can form hydrogen bonds. However,
      ethanol has an additional hydrogen atom in its molecular structure, which allows

    773249ed-892e-4b63-8516-fe67fb273bb3: 'To determine which substance has a higher
      boiling point between ethanol and methanol, we need to consider the following
      steps:


      Step 1: Understand the factors that influence boiling point.

      The boiling point of a substance is primarily determined by the strength of
      intermolecular forces between its molecules. Stronger intermolecular forces
      require more energy to overcome, resulting in a higher boiling point.


      Step 2: Compare the molecular structures of ethanol and methanol.

      Ethanol (C2H5OH) is an alcohol with two carbon atoms and a hydroxyl group (-OH).
      Methanol (CH3OH) is also an alcohol but with only one carbon atom and a hydroxyl
      group.


      Step 3: Consider the intermolecular forces present.

      Both ethanol and methanol can form hydrogen bonds due to the presence of the
      hydroxyl group. However, ethanol has a larger nonpolar hydrocarbon portion (two
      carbon atoms) compared to methanol (one carbon atom). This larger nonpolar portion
      in ethanol allows for stronger van der Waals forces (induced dipole-induced
      dipole interactions) between ethanol molecules.


      Step 4: Analyze the combined effect of intermolecular forces.

      While both substances can form hydrogen bonds, the additional van der Waals
      forces present in ethanol contribute to stronger overall intermolecular attractions
      between its molecules compared to methanol.


      Step 5: Relate intermolecular forces to boiling point.

      Substances with stronger intermolecular forces require more energy to overcome
      these attractive forces and transition from the liquid to the gaseous state,
      resulting in a higher boiling point.


      Final answer: Based on the reasoning above, ethanol has a higher boiling point
      than methanol due to the combined effect of hydrogen bonding and stronger van
      der Waals forces between its molecules.'

      The boiling point of a substance is influenced by the strength of intermolecular
      forces between its molecules. Generally, stronger intermolecular forces lead
      to higher boiling points.


      Step 2: Compare the molecular structures of ethanol and methanol.

      Ethanol (C2H6O) is an alcohol with two carbon atoms and one hydroxyl (-OH) group,
      while methanol (CH4O) is an alcohol with one carbon atom and one hydroxyl group.


      Step 3: Consider the intermolecular forces present.

      Both ethanol and methanol can form hydrogen bonds due to the presence of the
      hydroxyl group. However, ethanol has a larger nonpolar hydrocarbon portion (two
      carbon atoms) compared to methanol (one carbon atom).


      Step 4: Analyze the effect of molecular size and shape.

      Larger molecules generally have stronger van der Waals forces (dispersion forces)
      due to their increased polarizability. The larger size and slightly more complex
      shape of the ethanol molecule allow for stronger van der Waals forces compared
      to methanol.


      Step 5: Combine the effects of intermolecular forces.

      While both substances can form hydrogen bonds, the additional van der Waals
      forces present in ethanol due to its larger size and shape contribute to stronger
      overall intermolecular attractions.


      Final answer: Ethanol has a higher boiling point than methanol.


      The stronger intermolecular forces in ethanol, arising from both hydrogen bonding
      and van der Waals forces, result in a higher boiling point compared to methanol,
      which has weaker van der Waals forces due to its smaller size and simpler structure.'

      Step 1: Molecular weight

      Generally, the higher the molecular weight of a substance, the higher its boiling
      point. This is because heavier molecules have stronger intermolecular forces,
      which require more energy to overcome and transition into the gaseous state.


      The molecular weight of ethanol (C2H6O) is 46.07 g/mol, while the molecular

      Step 2: Intermolecular forces

      However, molecular weight is not the only factor that affects boiling point.
      The type and strength of intermolecular forces also play a crucial role.


      Both ethanol and methanol are polar molecules, meaning they can form hydrogen
      bonds. Hydrogen bonding is a strong intermolecular force that increases the

      Methanol has one hydrogen atom attached to the oxygen atom, allowing it to form

      Taking into account both molecular weight and intermolecular forces, the higher
      boiling point of ethanol compared to methanol can be attributed to the combined
      effect of its higher molecular weight and stronger hydrogen bonding capabilities.

      asymmetric distribution of electrons. This means they can exhibit dipole-dipole

      Step 2: Compare the strengths of intermolecular forces.

      Methanol has a hydroxyl group (-OH) that can form stronger hydrogen bonds compared
      to the carbonyl group (C=O) in acetone. Stronger intermolecular forces generally

      to acetone.


      After considering these factors, the final answer is:


      Methanol has a higher boiling point than acetone.

    cde3f28a-5e16-4abc-8ee7-484e49d59961: 'To determine which substance has a higher
      boiling point between methanol and acetone, we need to consider the intermolecular
      forces present in each substance and their relative strengths. Here''s the step-by-step
      reasoning:


      Step 1: Identify the types of intermolecular forces present in each substance.

      - Methanol (CH3OH) is a polar molecule due to the presence of the O-H bond,
      which means it can form hydrogen bonds and has dipole-dipole interactions.

      - Acetone (CH3COCH3) is a polar molecule due to the presence of the C=O bond,
      which means it can have dipole-dipole interactions, but it cannot form hydrogen
      bonds.


      Step 2: Compare the strengths of the intermolecular forces.

      - Hydrogen bonding is generally stronger than dipole-dipole interactions.

      - Since methanol can form hydrogen bonds, while acetone cannot, the intermolecular
      forces in methanol are stronger than those in acetone.


      Step 3: Relate the strength of intermolecular forces to boiling point.

      - Stronger intermolecular forces require more energy to overcome and break apart
      the molecules, resulting in a higher boiling point.

      - Weaker intermolecular forces require less energy to overcome, leading to a
      lower boiling point.


      Step 4: Conclude the substance with the higher boiling point.

      Based on the reasoning above, methanol has stronger intermolecular forces (hydrogen
      bonding and dipole-dipole interactions) compared to acetone (only dipole-dipole
      interactions). Therefore, methanol has a higher boiling point than acetone.


      Final answer: Methanol has a higher boiling point than acetone.'

      boiling point between lead and mercury, we need to consider their atomic masses
      and the strength of the intermolecular forces present in each substance. Here''s
      the step-by-step reasoning:


      Step 1: Understand the nature of lead and mercury.

      Lead (Pb) is a solid metallic element at room temperature, while mercury (Hg)
      is a liquid metallic element at room temperature.


      Step 2: Consider the atomic masses.

      The atomic mass of lead is higher (207.2 g/mol) compared to mercury (200.59
      g/mol). Generally, substances with higher atomic masses tend to have stronger
      intermolecular forces, which can lead to higher boiling points.


      Step 3: Analyze the intermolecular forces.

      Both lead and mercury are metallic elements, which means they have metallic
      bonding. In metallic bonding, the atoms are held together by the electrostatic
      attraction between the positively charged metal ions and the delocalized electrons
      (sea of electrons).


      Step 4: Compare the strengths of the intermolecular forces.

      The strength of the metallic bonding is influenced by the number of delocalized
      electrons and the effective nuclear charge (the positive charge experienced
      by the valence electrons due to the nucleus and the shielding effect of inner
      electrons).


      In the case of lead, it has a higher effective nuclear charge compared to mercury,
      which means the valence electrons in lead experience a stronger attractive force
      from the nucleus. This stronger attractive force results in stronger metallic
      bonding in lead compared to mercury.


      Step 5: Relate the intermolecular forces to the boiling point.

      Substances with stronger intermolecular forces generally have higher boiling
      points because more energy is required to overcome the attractive forces and
      separate the particles into the gaseous state.


      Final answer:

      Based on the step-by-step reasoning, lead (Pb) has stronger intermolecular forces
      (metallic bonding) compared to mercury (Hg) due to its higher effective nuclear
      charge. Therefore, lead has a higher boiling point than mercury.'

      element at room temperature.


      Step 2: Consider the factors that influence boiling point.

      The boiling point of a substance is the temperature at which the vapor pressure

      of the intermolecular forces between the particles (atoms or molecules) of the
      substance.


      Step 3: Compare the intermolecular forces.

      Intermolecular forces are generally stronger in solids than in liquids because

      elemental molecule.


      Step 2: Consider the intermolecular forces present.

      The strength of intermolecular forces plays a significant role in determining
      the boiling point of a substance.


      In the case of carbon dioxide, there are weak van der Waals forces (London dispersion
      forces) between the molecules. These forces arise due to the temporary dipole-induced
      dipole interactions between the nonpolar CO2 molecules.


      On the other hand, oxygen molecules also exhibit van der Waals forces, specifically
      London dispersion forces due to their nonpolar nature.


      Step 3: Compare the molecular masses.

      Generally, substances with higher molecular masses tend to have stronger van
      der Waals forces and, consequently, higher boiling points.


      The molecular mass of carbon dioxide (CO2) is 44.01 g/mol.

      The molecular mass of oxygen (O2) is 32.00 g/mol.


      Since carbon dioxide has a higher molecular mass, it is expected to have stronger
      van der Waals forces between its molecules compared to oxygen.


      Step 4: Consider other factors.

      In addition to intermolecular forces and molecular mass, factors such as molecular
      geometry and polarity can also influence the boiling point. However, in this
      case, both substances are nonpolar, and their molecular geometries (linear for
      CO2 and bent for O2) do not significantly affect the overall trend.


      Final answer:

      Based on the reasoning above, carbon dioxide (CO2) is expected to have a higher
      boiling point than oxygen (O2) due to its higher molecular mass and stronger
      van der Waals forces between its molecules.'

      boiling point between iron and copper, we need to consider the following steps:


      Step 1: Understand the nature of boiling point.

      The boiling point of a substance is the temperature at which the vapor pressure
      of the liquid equals the atmospheric pressure, and the liquid starts to vaporize
      rapidly. It is a characteristic property of a substance that depends on the
      strength of the intermolecular forces between its particles.

      metallic bonds, which result from the delocalized electrons that hold the positive
      metal ions together in a lattice structure.


      Step 3: Compare the metallic bonding strengths.

      The strength of the metallic bond is influenced by several factors, including
      the number of delocalized electrons, the nuclear charge, and the atomic radius.
      Generally, metals with higher atomic numbers and smaller atomic radii tend to
      have stronger metallic bonds.

      Copper has a higher atomic number and a slightly smaller atomic radius compared
      to iron. This indicates that copper has a stronger metallic bond due to the
      greater nuclear charge and closer proximity of the delocalized electrons.


      Step 6: Relate the bond strength to the boiling point.

      Substances with stronger intermolecular forces (in this case, metallic bonds)

      The boiling point of a substance is primarily determined by the strength of

      boiling point between gold and iron, we need to consider the following steps:


      Step 1: Understand the nature of boiling point.

      The boiling point of a substance is the temperature at which the vapor pressure
      of the liquid equals the atmospheric pressure, and the liquid begins to boil
      or vaporize.


      Step 2: Consider the atomic properties of gold and iron.

      Gold (Au) is a dense, non-reactive noble metal with a high atomic mass of 196.97
      u.

      Iron (Fe) is a relatively less dense transition metal with a lower atomic mass
      of 55.85 u.


      Step 3: Relate atomic properties to intermolecular forces.

      Generally, substances with stronger intermolecular forces (such as metallic
      bonds) have higher boiling points. The strength of these forces is influenced
      by factors like atomic mass and electron configuration.


      Step 4: Compare the intermolecular forces in gold and iron.

      Gold, being a heavier and more massive atom, tends to have stronger metallic
      bonds and greater attractive forces between its atoms compared to iron.


      Step 5: Draw the conclusion.

      Substances with stronger intermolecular forces require more energy to overcome
      the attractive forces and transition from the liquid to the gaseous state. Therefore,
      gold, with its stronger metallic bonds, is expected to have a higher boiling
      point than iron.

      Step 2: Consider the types of particles and bonding in the substances.

      Both aluminum and silver are metallic elements, which means they have a crystalline

      substance with only weak van der Waals forces between its atoms.


      Step 3: Consider the molar masses.

      The molar mass of water is 18.02 g/mol, while the molar mass of mercury is 200.59
      g/mol. Generally, substances with higher molar masses have higher boiling points
      due to stronger intermolecular forces.


      Step 4: Combine the effects of intermolecular forces and molar mass.

      Although mercury has a higher molar mass, water has much stronger intermolecular
      forces (hydrogen bonding) compared to the weak van der Waals forces in mercury.
      The stronger intermolecular forces in water outweigh the effect of the lower
      molar mass.


      Final answer: Water has a higher boiling point than mercury.'
    4d24d4ac-0bab-474d-a16f-efc051588b6e: 'To determine which substance has a higher
      boiling point between mercury and water, we need to consider the following steps:


      Step 1: Understand the concept of boiling point.

      The boiling point of a substance is the temperature at which the vapor pressure
      of the liquid equals the atmospheric pressure, and the liquid phase transitions
      to the gaseous phase.


      Step 2: Consider the factors that influence boiling point.

      The boiling point of a substance is primarily determined by the strength of
      the intermolecular forces (IMFs) between its molecules or atoms. Stronger IMFs
      require more energy to overcome, resulting in a higher boiling point.


      Step 3: Compare the intermolecular forces in mercury and water.

      Mercury (Hg) is an elemental liquid composed of individual atoms. The predominant
      IMFs in mercury are van der Waals forces, which are relatively weak.

      Water (H2O), on the other hand, is a polar molecular compound with hydrogen
      bonding, which is a strong type of IMF.


      Step 4: Evaluate the relative strengths of the intermolecular forces.

      Hydrogen bonding in water is significantly stronger than the van der Waals forces
      in mercury.


      Step 5: Relate the intermolecular forces to the boiling point.

      Substances with stronger IMFs generally have higher boiling points because more
      energy is required to overcome the attractive forces and transition from the
      liquid to the gaseous phase.


      Final answer:

      Based on the reasoning above, water has a higher boiling point than mercury.
      The strong hydrogen bonding in water requires more energy to disrupt compared
      to the relatively weaker van der Waals forces in mercury, resulting in a higher
      boiling point for water.'

      Mercury (Hg) is a metallic element with relatively weak intermolecular forces
      between its atoms, primarily van der Waals forces.

      Water (H2O), on the other hand, has strong hydrogen bonding between its molecules

      Water (H2O):

      - Water molecules are polar due to the electronegativity difference between

      - Water molecules form strong hydrogen bonds with each other, resulting in strong
      intermolecular forces.


      Ethanol (C2H5OH):

      - Ethanol molecules are also polar due to the presence of the hydroxyl (-OH)
      group.

      - Ethanol molecules can form hydrogen bonds, but these bonds are weaker than

      The stronger the intermolecular forces, the higher the boiling point. Substances
      with stronger intermolecular forces require more energy to overcome the attractive
      forces between molecules and transition from the liquid to the gaseous state.

      boiling point between acetone and carbon dioxide, we need to consider the following

      Step 1: Identify the state of the substances at room temperature and atmospheric
      pressure.

      Acetone is a liquid, and carbon dioxide is a gas.


      Step 2: Consider the intermolecular forces present in each substance.

      Acetone is an organic compound with polar covalent bonds, which means there
      are dipole-dipole interactions and weak hydrogen bonding present between the
      molecules. These intermolecular forces contribute to the attractive forces holding
      the molecules together.

    0eb665da-278a-4ddb-81cb-37780efeae78: 'To determine which substance has a higher
      boiling point between copper and aluminum, we need to consider the following
      factors:


      Step 1: Identify the type of bonding present in each substance.

      Copper and aluminum are both metals, which means they have metallic bonding.
      In metallic bonding, the atoms are held together by the electrostatic attraction
      between the positively charged metal cations and the delocalized electrons.


      Step 2: Consider the strength of the metallic bonding.

      The strength of the metallic bonding is influenced by the number of delocalized
      electrons and the nuclear charge of the metal atoms. Generally, metals with
      higher atomic numbers and more delocalized electrons have stronger metallic
      bonding.


      Step 3: Compare the atomic numbers and metallic bonding strengths.

      Copper has an atomic number of 29, while aluminum has an atomic number of 13.
      Copper has more protons in its nucleus and, consequently, a higher nuclear charge,
      which results in stronger metallic bonding compared to aluminum.


      Step 4: Relate the bonding strength to the boiling point.

      Substances with stronger intermolecular or interatomic forces generally have
      higher boiling points because more energy is required to overcome these forces
      and separate the particles into the gaseous state.


      Therefore, considering the steps above, copper has stronger metallic bonding
      compared to aluminum due to its higher atomic number and nuclear charge.


      Final answer: Copper has a higher boiling point than aluminum.'

      boiling point between copper and aluminum, we need to consider the following
      factors:


      Step 1: Understand the nature of the substances.

      Copper (Cu) and aluminum (Al) are both metals.


      Step 2: Consider the atomic/molecular structure.

      Metals are composed of atoms arranged in a crystalline structure, held together
      by metallic bonds. The strength of these metallic bonds is influenced by the
      number of delocalized valence electrons and the atomic radius.


      Step 3: Compare the relevant properties.

      a) Atomic radius: Copper has a smaller atomic radius (128 pm) compared to aluminum
      (143 pm).

      b) Metallic bonding: Stronger metallic bonds generally result in higher boiling
      points.


      Step 4: Analyze the factors affecting boiling point.

      Smaller atomic radii typically lead to stronger metallic bonds due to the increased
      effective nuclear charge experienced by the valence electrons. This results
      in higher boiling points.


      Step 5: Determine the substance with the higher boiling point.

      Since copper has a smaller atomic radius than aluminum, it experiences stronger
      metallic bonding. Consequently, copper has a higher boiling point than aluminum.

      boiling point between copper and aluminum, we need to consider the following
      factors:


      Step 1: Metallic bonds and melting points

      Both copper and aluminum are metals, which means they have metallic bonds. Metals
      generally have high melting and boiling points due to the strong attractive
      forces between the positively charged metal ions and the delocalized electrons
      in the metallic lattice.


      Step 2: Atomic mass and strength of metallic bonds

      The strength of metallic bonds is influenced by the atomic mass of the metal.
      Heavier atoms tend to have stronger metallic bonds, which require more energy
      to overcome and break apart, leading to higher melting and boiling points.


      Copper has an atomic mass of 63.55 u (unified atomic mass units), while aluminum
      has an atomic mass of 26.98 u. Since copper is heavier than aluminum, it is
      expected to have stronger metallic bonds.


      Step 3: Consideration of other factors

      While atomic mass is a significant factor, other factors like atomic radius,
      electron configuration, and crystal structure can also influence the melting
      and boiling points of metals. However, for the given question, we can assume
      that the atomic mass difference is the primary factor determining the difference
      in boiling points.


      Final answer:

      Based on the reasoning above, copper has a higher boiling point than aluminum.
      The heavier atomic mass of copper leads to stronger metallic bonds, which require
      more energy to break apart, resulting in a higher boiling point compared to
      aluminum.'

      boiling point between copper and aluminum, we need to consider the following
      steps:


      Step 1: Understand the factors that affect the boiling point of a substance.

      The boiling point of a substance is primarily determined by the strength of
      the intermolecular forces between its particles (atoms, molecules, or ions).
      Stronger intermolecular forces require more energy to overcome, resulting in
      a higher boiling point.


      Step 2: Identify the types of particles present in copper and aluminum.

      Copper and aluminum are both metals, which means they exist as solid crystalline
      structures held together by metallic bonds. In metallic bonds, the valence electrons
      are delocalized and shared among the metal atoms, forming a "sea of electrons."


      Step 3: Consider the metallic bonding and atomic properties.

      The strength of metallic bonding is influenced by the number of delocalized
      electrons and the atomic size (or atomic radius) of the metal atoms.


      Copper has an atomic number of 29 and an atomic radius of 128 picometers (pm).

      Aluminum has an atomic number of 13 and a larger atomic radius of 143 pm.


      Generally, smaller atoms with more delocalized electrons tend to have stronger

      Step 4: Compare the atomic properties and deduce the boiling point order.

      Copper has a smaller atomic radius and more delocalized electrons compared to
      aluminum. This suggests that the metallic bonding in copper is stronger than
      in aluminum.


      Stronger metallic bonding requires more energy to overcome, leading to a higher
      boiling point.

      boiling point between copper and aluminum, we need to consider the following
      factors:


      Step 1: Identify the state of the substances at room temperature.

      Both copper and aluminum are solid metals at room temperature.


      Step 2: Compare the metallic bonding strength.

      Metallic bonding is the attractive force that holds the metal atoms together
      in a solid lattice structure. The stronger the metallic bonding, the higher
      the energy required to overcome it and transition from the solid to the liquid
      state, resulting in a higher boiling point.


      Step 3: Consider the atomic properties that influence metallic bonding strength.

      The strength of metallic bonding is primarily determined by the number of delocalized
      valence electrons and the atomic radius of the metal atoms.


      a) Number of delocalized valence electrons:

      Copper has one delocalized valence electron (electronic configuration: [Ar]
      3d^10 4s^1).

      Aluminum has three delocalized valence electrons (electronic configuration:
      [Ne] 3s^2 3p^1).

      More delocalized valence electrons generally lead to stronger metallic bonding.


      b) Atomic radius:

      Copper has a smaller atomic radius (127.8 pm) compared to aluminum (143.2 pm).

      Smaller atomic radii result in stronger metallic bonding due to the closer proximity
      of the metal atoms.


      Step 4: Evaluate the combined effect of the factors.

      Copper has fewer delocalized valence electrons compared to aluminum, which would
      suggest a weaker metallic bonding. However, copper''s smaller atomic radius
      contributes to stronger metallic bonding.


      In this case, the atomic radius factor has a more significant influence on the
      metallic bonding strength than the number of delocalized valence electrons.


      Final answer: Copper has a higher boiling point than aluminum due to its smaller
      atomic radius, which results in stronger metallic bonding, despite having fewer
      delocalized valence electrons.'
