      C (4,644\xB0F)\n   \u2022 Aluminum's boiling point is approximately 2,470\xB0\
      C (4,478\xB0F)\n\n3. Comparing these two values directly shows that copper has\
      \ a higher boiling point.\n\n4. This higher boiling point is related to copper's\
      \ stronger metallic bonding and higher atomic mass compared to aluminum.\n\n\
      5. The stronger metallic bonds in copper require more energy to break, which\
      \ means it takes a higher temperature to convert copper from a liquid to a gas.\n\
      \nTherefore, copper has a higher boiling point than aluminum."

      \ compare boiling points, we first need to consider the physical properties\
      \ of copper and aluminum.\n\n2. Boiling point is related to the strength of\
      \ metallic bonds between atoms.\n\n3. To assess metallic bond strength, we'll\
      \ look at a few key factors:\n   - Atomic weight\n   - Electron configuration\n\
      \   - Melting point (which often correlates with bond strength)\n\n4. Copper's\
      \ properties:\n   - Atomic weight: 63.5 g/mol\n   - Melting point: 1,084\xB0\
      C\n   - More loosely packed electron configuration\n\n5. Aluminum's properties:\n\
      \   - Atomic weight: 26.98 g/mol\n   - Melting point: 660\xB0C\n   - Simpler\
      \ electron configuration\n\n6. Copper has:\n   - Higher atomic weight\n   -\
      \ Higher melting point\n   - Suggests stronger metallic bonds\n\n7. These factors\
      \ indicate that copper will have a higher boiling point.\n\n8. Checking reference\
      \ data confirms this: \n   - Copper boiling point: 2,562\xB0C\n   - Aluminum\
      \ boiling point: 2,470\xB0C\n\nTherefore, copper has a higher boiling point\
      \ than aluminum."

      \ mass\n   - Number of valence electrons\n   - Atomic structure\n\n3. Let's\

      \ [Ne] 3s\xB2\n   - Fewer electrons available for metallic bonding\n\n5. Copper\

      \ point than aluminum.\n\nSpecific boiling points confirm this:\n- Copper: 2,562\xB0\
      C\n- Aluminum: 2,470\xB0C\n\nThe answer is: Copper has a higher boiling point."
