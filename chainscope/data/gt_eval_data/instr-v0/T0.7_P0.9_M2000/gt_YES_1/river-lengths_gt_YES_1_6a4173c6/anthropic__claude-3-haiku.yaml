      Step 1: Gather information about the lengths of the River Rhine and the River
      Seine.

      - The River Rhine is approximately 1,233 km (766 miles) long.

      - The River Seine is approximately 776 km (483 miles) long.


      Step 2: Compare the lengths of the two rivers.

      - The River Rhine, at 1,233 km, is significantly longer than the River Seine,
      which is 776 km.


      Step 3: Provide the final answer.

      The River Rhine is longer than the River Seine.'

      empties into the English Channel.

      2. The River Thames is a river in southern England that flows through London
      and empties into the North Sea.

      3. To determine which river is longer, we need to compare the total length of
      each river.

      4. According to available information, the River Seine is approximately 777
      km (483 miles) long.

      5. The River Thames is approximately 346 km (215 miles) long.

      6. Therefore, the River Seine is longer than the River Thames.


      Final answer: The River Seine is longer than the River Thames.'
