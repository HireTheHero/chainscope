      1. First, I need to determine when each aircraft made its first flight.


      2. For Concorde:

      - The Concorde''s first flight was on March 2, 1969

      - This was the first prototype flight from Toulouse, France


      3. For Boeing 737:

      - The Boeing 737''s first flight was on April 9, 1967
