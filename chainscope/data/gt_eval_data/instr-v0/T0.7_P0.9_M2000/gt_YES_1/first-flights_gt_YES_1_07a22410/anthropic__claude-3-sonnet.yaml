      The aircraft mentioned are the DC-3 and the Spirit of St. Louis.


      Step 2: Recall what each aircraft is.

      The DC-3 is a popular commercial passenger and cargo aircraft that was introduced
      in the 1930s and played a significant role in the development of commercial
      aviation.

      The Spirit of St. Louis is the single-engine monoplane that Charles Lindbergh
      flew in 1927 to complete the first solo non-stop transatlantic flight from New
      York to Paris.


      Step 3: Determine the first flight dates of each aircraft.

      The DC-3 (originally called the Douglas Sleeper Transport) made its first flight
      on December 17, 1935.

      The Spirit of St. Louis made its first flight on April 28, 1927, when Lindbergh
      departed from Roosevelt Field in New York.


      Step 4: Compare the first flight dates to determine which aircraft made its
      first flight later.

      The DC-3 made its first flight on December 17, 1935, which is later than the

      XP-51) took place on October 26, 1940.


      Spitfire:

      The Spitfire was a British single-seat fighter aircraft used by the Royal Air
      Force and other Allied countries during World War II. The first flight of the
      Spitfire prototype (designated K5054) took place on March 5, 1936.


      Step 3: Compare the first flight dates.

      The Spitfire prototype had its first flight on March 5, 1936, while the P-51
      Mustang prototype had its first flight on October 26, 1940.


      Step 4: Determine which aircraft made its first flight later.

      Since the P-51 Mustang prototype had its first flight in 1940, which is after
      1936 (the year of the Spitfire prototype''s first flight), the P-51 Mustang
      made its first flight later than the Spitfire.

    c133dc7b-b232-4f97-92ad-c1690f6afb4a: 'Sure, let''s break this down step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the aircraft in question.

      The two aircraft mentioned are the Boeing 737 and the SR-71 Blackbird.


      Step 2: Gather information about the first flight of each aircraft.

      The Boeing 737 is a commercial passenger jet airliner. The first flight of the
      Boeing 737 took place on April 9, 1967.


      The SR-71 Blackbird is a long-range, advanced strategic reconnaissance aircraft
      developed by Lockheed''s Skunk Works division. The first flight of the SR-71
      Blackbird took place on December 22, 1964.


      Step 3: Compare the first flight dates of the two aircraft.

      The SR-71 Blackbird made its first flight on December 22, 1964, which is earlier
      than the Boeing 737''s first flight on April 9, 1967.


      Step 4: Determine the answer based on the comparison.

      Since the question asks which aircraft made its first flight later, and the
      Boeing 737 made its first flight after the SR-71 Blackbird, the answer is:


      The Boeing 737 made its first flight later than the SR-71 Blackbird.'
