      the SR-71 Blackbird.


      Step 1: Gather the first flight information for each aircraft.

      - Boeing 737: The first flight of the Boeing 737 took place on April 9, 1967.

      - SR-71 Blackbird: The first flight of the SR-71 Blackbird (originally designated
      A-12 OXCART) took place on April 30, 1962.


      Step 2: Compare the first flight dates.

      - The Boeing 737 made its first flight on April 9, 1967.

      - The SR-71 Blackbird made its first flight on April 30, 1962.


      Step 3: Determine which aircraft made its first flight later.

      - The SR-71 Blackbird made its first flight earlier, on April 30, 1962.

      - The Boeing 737 made its first flight later, on April 9, 1967.

      1. The Boeing 737 is a commercial passenger aircraft, first introduced in the
      1960s.

      2. The SR-71 Blackbird is a high-altitude, high-speed reconnaissance aircraft,
      developed by Lockheed Martin in the 1960s.

      3. To determine which one made its first flight later, we need to look at the
      first flight dates for each aircraft.


      4. The Boeing 737 made its first flight on April 9, 1967.

      5. The SR-71 Blackbird made its first flight on April 22, 1962.


      6. Therefore, the aircraft that made its first flight later is the Boeing 737,
      not the SR-71 Blackbird.
