    0328400d-4d85-41dd-b9dd-6005ca18b909: 'Sure, let''s break it down step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the structures mentioned in the question.

      The two structures mentioned are the Hoover Dam and the Golden Gate Bridge.


      Step 2: Recall or look up the construction dates for each structure.

      Hoover Dam:

      - Construction began in 1931.

      - It was completed in 1935.


      Golden Gate Bridge:

      - Construction began in 1933.

      - It was completed in 1937.


      Step 3: Compare the completion dates of the two structures.

      Hoover Dam was completed in 1935.

      Golden Gate Bridge was completed in 1937.


      Step 4: Determine which structure was completed later based on the comparison.

      Since the Golden Gate Bridge was completed in 1937, which is after 1935 when
      the Hoover Dam was completed, the Golden Gate Bridge was completed later.


      Final Answer: The Golden Gate Bridge was completed later than the Hoover Dam.'

      Step 2: Gather information about the construction timelines of each structure.

      Empire State Building:

      - Construction began in 1930.

      - The building was officially opened on May 1, 1931.


      Hoover Dam:

      - Construction began in 1931.

      - The dam was completed in 1935, and its dedication ceremony took place on September
      30, 1935.


      Step 3: Compare the completion dates of the two structures.

      The Empire State Building was completed and opened in 1931, while the Hoover
      Dam was completed in 1935.


      Step 4: Determine the answer based on the comparison.

      Since the Hoover Dam was completed in 1935, which is later than the completion
      of the Empire State Building in 1931, the structure that was completed later
      is the Hoover Dam.


      Final Answer: The Hoover Dam was completed later than the Empire State Building.'

      Step 1: Determine the completion year of the Panama Canal.

      The Panama Canal was an ambitious project that involved constructing an artificial
      waterway across the Isthmus of Panama to connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.
      The construction began in 1904 and was completed in 1914.


      Step 2: Determine the completion year of the Empire State Building.

      The Empire State Building is a iconic skyscraper located in Midtown Manhattan,
      New York City. Its construction began in 1930, and it was officially completed
      in 1931.
