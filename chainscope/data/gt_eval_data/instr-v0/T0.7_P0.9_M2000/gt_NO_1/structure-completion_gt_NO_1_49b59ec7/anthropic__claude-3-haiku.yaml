      later, Hoover Dam or the Golden Gate Bridge, let''s go through the steps of
      reasoning:


      Step 1: Identify the completion dates of the two structures.

      - Hoover Dam was completed in 1935.

      - The Golden Gate Bridge was completed in 1937.


      Step 2: Compare the completion dates.

      - The Golden Gate Bridge was completed in 1937, which is later than the completion
      of Hoover Dam in 1935.


      Therefore, the final answer is:

      The Golden Gate Bridge was completed later than Hoover Dam.'
    1aafd43a-ffeb-41bf-bc04-b0201088ffac: 'To determine which structure was completed
      later between Hoover Dam and Golden Gate Bridge, let''s go through the step-by-step
      reasoning:


      Step 1: Identify the completion dates of the two structures.

      Hoover Dam:

      - Construction began in 1931 and was completed in 1935.


      Golden Gate Bridge:

      - Construction began in 1933 and was completed in 1937.


      Step 2: Compare the completion dates.

      The Hoover Dam was completed in 1935, while the Golden Gate Bridge was completed
      in 1937.


      Step 3: Determine the later-completed structure.

      Since the Golden Gate Bridge was completed in 1937, and the Hoover Dam was completed
      earlier in 1935, the Golden Gate Bridge was completed later.


      Final answer:

      The Golden Gate Bridge was completed later than the Hoover Dam.'

      1. Gather the relevant information about the completion dates of Hoover Dam

      Hoover Dam:

      Golden Gate Bridge:

      - Construction began in 1933 and was completed in 1937.


      2. Compare the completion dates of the two structures.

      - Hoover Dam was completed in 1935.

      - Golden Gate Bridge was completed in 1937.


      3. Determine which structure was completed later.

      - Since the Golden Gate Bridge was completed in 1937, and Hoover Dam was completed
      in 1935, the Golden Gate Bridge was completed later.


      Therefore, the answer is:
