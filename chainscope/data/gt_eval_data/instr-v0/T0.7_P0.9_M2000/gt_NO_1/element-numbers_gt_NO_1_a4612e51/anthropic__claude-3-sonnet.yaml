      these steps:


      Step 1: Understand the concept of atomic number.

      The atomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. It is
      a fundamental property of an element and is unique for each element.


      Step 2: Recall the atomic numbers of hydrogen and helium.

      Hydrogen (H) has an atomic number of 1, meaning it has one proton in its nucleus.

      Helium (He) has an atomic number of 2, meaning it has two protons in its nucleus.


      Step 3: Compare the atomic numbers of hydrogen and helium.

      Since helium has an atomic number of 2, which is greater than the atomic number
      of 1 for hydrogen, we can conclude that helium has a higher atomic number than
      hydrogen.


      Final answer: Helium has a higher atomic number than hydrogen.'

      The atomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. It is

      different elements from one another.


      Step 2: Recall the atomic numbers of hydrogen and helium.

      Hydrogen (H) has an atomic number of 1, meaning it has one proton in its nucleus.

      Helium (He) has an atomic number of 2, meaning it has two protons in its nucleus.


      Step 3: Compare the atomic numbers of hydrogen and helium.

      Since the atomic number of helium (2) is greater than the atomic number of hydrogen
      (1), this means that helium has more protons in its nucleus than hydrogen.


      Step 4: Provide the final answer.

      The element with a higher atomic number is helium.'

      Step 1: Understand the concept of atomic number.

      The atomic number is a fundamental property of an element that represents the
      number of protons in the nucleus of an atom of that element.


      Step 2: Identify the elements in question.

      The elements mentioned in the question are hydrogen (H) and helium (He).


      Step 3: Recall the atomic numbers of hydrogen and helium.

      The atomic number of hydrogen is 1, as it has one proton in its nucleus.

      The atomic number of helium is 2, as it has two protons in its nucleus.


      Step 4: Compare the atomic numbers.

      Since helium has an atomic number of 2, which is higher than the atomic number
      of hydrogen (1), we can conclude that helium has a higher atomic number than
      hydrogen.

      Step 1: Understand the question.

      The question is asking which of the two elements, hydrogen or helium, has a
      higher atomic number.


      Step 2: Recall the definition of atomic number.

      The atomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. It is
      a fundamental property of an element and determines its chemical identity.


      Step 3: Identify the atomic numbers of hydrogen and helium.

      Hydrogen (H) has an atomic number of 1, meaning its nucleus contains one proton.

      Helium (He) has an atomic number of 2, meaning its nucleus contains two protons.


      Step 4: Compare the atomic numbers.

      another.


      Step 2: Consider the elements silver (Ag) and gold (Au). Silver is a transition
      metal, and gold is a transition metal as well, but it belongs to a different
      group in the periodic table.

      Step 2: Identify the elements in question. The elements mentioned are aluminum
      (Al) and silicon (Si).


      Step 3: Determine the atomic number of each element. This information can be
      found in the periodic table of elements.
