      step:


      1. Atomic number: The atomic number of an element is the number of protons in
      its nucleus. It is a unique identifier for each element and determines its position
      in the periodic table.


      2. Hydrogen: Hydrogen is the first element in the periodic table. It has an
      atomic number of 1, meaning it has one proton in its nucleus.


      3. Helium: Helium is the second element in the periodic table, coming right
      after hydrogen. Since elements in the periodic table are arranged in order of
      increasing atomic number, helium must have an atomic number greater than that
      of hydrogen.


      4. Comparing atomic numbers: Given that helium comes after hydrogen in the periodic
      table, and elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number, we can
      conclude that helium has a higher atomic number than hydrogen.


      Final answer: Helium has a higher atomic number than hydrogen.'
    3ae87f38-c4e2-4472-a23e-48e825069a2f: 'To determine which element has a higher
      atomic number between hydrogen and helium, let''s think through this step by
      step:


      Step 1: Understand what atomic number means.

      - The atomic number of an element is the number of protons in the nucleus of
      an atom of that element.

      - It is a unique identifier for each element and determines its position in
      the periodic table.


      Step 2: Recall the position of hydrogen and helium in the periodic table.

      - Hydrogen is the first element in the periodic table.

      - Helium is the second element in the periodic table.


      Step 3: Relate the position in the periodic table to the atomic number.

      - Elements in the periodic table are arranged in order of increasing atomic
      number.

      - The element with a lower position in the periodic table has a lower atomic
      number.

      - The element with a higher position in the periodic table has a higher atomic
      number.


      Step 4: Compare the positions of hydrogen and helium.

      - Hydrogen is the first element, and helium is the second element in the periodic
      table.

      hydrogen.

      Step 3: Identify the positions of hydrogen and helium in the periodic table.

      - Hydrogen is the first element in the periodic table, located in the top left
      corner of the first period (row).

      - Helium is the second element in the periodic table, located at the end of
      the first period, to the right of hydrogen.

      The atomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. It is
      a unique identifier for each element and determines its position in the periodic
      table.


      Step 2: Locate calcium and iron in the periodic table.

      periodic table.

      Iron (Fe) is located in the 4th period (row) and 8th group (column) of the periodic
      table.


      Step 3: Compare the positions of calcium and iron in the periodic table.

      Both calcium and iron are in the same period (4th row), but iron is located
      further to the right in the periodic table compared to calcium.


      Step 4: Understand the relationship between an element''s position in the periodic
      table and its atomic number.

      In the periodic table, elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number
      from left to right and top to bottom. As we move from left to right in a period,
      the atomic number increases.


      Final answer: Since iron is located further to the right in the same period

      Step 2: Locate silicon and phosphorus on the periodic table.

      Silicon (Si) is located in the third period (row) and the 14th group (column).

      Phosphorus (P) is located in the third period (row) and the 15th group (column).


      Step 3: Compare the positions of silicon and phosphorus on the periodic table.

      Both elements are in the same period (row), but phosphorus is located one group
      (column) to the right of silicon.


      Step 4: Understand the relationship between an element''s position and its atomic
      number.

      As you move from left to right across a period on the periodic table, the atomic
      number increases by one for each element.

      is located one position to the right of silicon in the same period on the periodic
      table.'

      the periodic table.


      Step 3: Understand the relationship between an element''s position in the periodic
      table and its atomic number.

      In the periodic table, elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number
      from left to right and top to bottom. This means that elements in the same period
      have consecutive atomic numbers, and elements in higher periods have higher
      atomic numbers than those in lower periods.


      Step 4: Compare the positions of phosphorus and sulfur in the periodic table.

      Both phosphorus and sulfur are in the 3rd period, but sulfur is located to the
      right of phosphorus. This indicates that sulfur has a higher atomic number than
      phosphorus.


      Final answer: Sulfur has a higher atomic number than phosphorus.'

      Mercury (Hg) and lead (Pb) are both located in the sixth period of the periodic
      table. Mercury is in group 12 (IIB), while lead is in group 14 (IVA).


      Step 3: Understand the trend of atomic numbers in the periodic table.

      In the periodic table, elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number
      from left to right and top to bottom. This means that elements located further
      to the right and bottom of the table have higher atomic numbers.


      Step 4: Compare the positions of mercury and lead.

      Lead is located further to the right in the sixth period compared to mercury.
      Therefore, lead has a higher atomic number than mercury.


      Final answer: Lead (Pb) has a higher atomic number than mercury (Hg).'

      atomic number between nitrogen and oxygen, let''s think through this step by
      step:


      Step 1: Recall the definition of atomic number.

      The atomic number of an element is the number of protons in its nucleus. It
      is a unique identifier for each element and determines its position on the periodic
      table.


      Step 2: Recall the arrangement of elements on the periodic table.

      Elements are arranged on the periodic table in order of increasing atomic number
      from left to right and top to bottom.


      Step 3: Locate nitrogen and oxygen on the periodic table.

      Nitrogen (symbol N) and oxygen (symbol O) are both located in the first row
      (period) of the periodic table, in the second group (main group elements).


      Step 4: Compare the positions of nitrogen and oxygen.

      Nitrogen comes before oxygen on the periodic table, which means it is located
      to the left of oxygen.


      Step 5: Draw a conclusion based on the arrangement of elements on the periodic
      table.

      Since elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number from left to
      right, and nitrogen is located to the left of oxygen, we can conclude that nitrogen
      has a lower atomic number than oxygen.


      Final answer: Oxygen has a higher atomic number than nitrogen.'

      4. Comparing positions: On the periodic table, elements in the same period are
      arranged from left to right in order of increasing atomic number. Since oxygen

      order: hydrogen (H), helium (He), lithium (Li), beryllium (Be), boron (B), carbon
      (C), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), fluorine (F), and neon (Ne).
