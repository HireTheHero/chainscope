      atomic number, we need to follow these steps:


      Step 1: Understand the concept of atomic number.

      The atomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. It is
      a fundamental property that uniquely identifies each chemical element.


      Step 2: Identify the atomic numbers of hydrogen and helium.

      Hydrogen (H) has an atomic number of 1.

      Helium (He) has an atomic number of 2.


      Step 3: Compare the atomic numbers.

      Since helium has an atomic number of 2, and hydrogen has an atomic number of
      1, helium has a higher atomic number than hydrogen.


      Final answer: Helium has a higher atomic number than hydrogen.'

      atomic number between hydrogen and helium, we need to follow these steps:


      Step 1: Understand the concept of atomic number.

      The atomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. It is
      a fundamental property that uniquely identifies each element in the periodic
      table.


      Step 2: Compare the atomic numbers of hydrogen and helium.

      Hydrogen has an atomic number of 1, as it has 1 proton in its nucleus.

      Helium has an atomic number of 2, as it has 2 protons in its nucleus.


      Step 3: Conclude the answer.

      Since helium has an atomic number of 2, which is higher than the atomic number
      of hydrogen (1), helium has a higher atomic number than hydrogen.


      Therefore, the correct answer is that helium has a higher atomic number than
      hydrogen.'
    60cb96b7-e2f1-4fdd-a47e-470c0c182414: 'Okay, let''s go through this step-by-step:


      1. Atomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom.


      2. Hydrogen (H) has 1 proton in its nucleus.


      3. Helium (He) has 2 protons in its nucleus.


      4. Since helium has a higher number of protons (2) compared to hydrogen (1),
      helium has a higher atomic number.


      Therefore, the answer is:

      Helium (He) has a higher atomic number than hydrogen (H).'
    61d5650e-83bc-41cd-b6a4-7919b869b0fc: 'Okay, let''s think through this step-by-step:


      1. Hydrogen and helium are both elements on the periodic table.

      2. The periodic table is arranged in order of increasing atomic number.

      3. The atomic number of an element is the number of protons in the nucleus of
      its atoms.

      4. Hydrogen has 1 proton in its nucleus, so its atomic number is 1.

      5. Helium has 2 protons in its nucleus, so its atomic number is 2.


      Therefore, the element with the higher atomic number is helium.'

      The atomic number of oxygen is 8.


      Step 3: Compare the atomic numbers.

      Since the atomic number of oxygen (8) is higher than the atomic number of nitrogen
      (7), oxygen has a higher atomic number.


      Therefore, the answer is:

      Oxygen has a higher atomic number than nitrogen.'

      atomic number between nitrogen and oxygen, we can follow these steps:


      Step 1: Understand the concept of atomic number.

      The atomic number of an element is the number of protons in the nucleus of an
      atom of that element. It is a fundamental property of an element and is used
      to identify the element.


      Step 2: Recall the periodic table.

      The periodic table is a tabular arrangement of the chemical elements, ordered
      by their atomic number. Elements are arranged in increasing order of their atomic
      number.


      Step 3: Locate nitrogen and oxygen on the periodic table.

      Nitrogen (N) has the atomic number 7, while oxygen (O) has the atomic number
      8.


      Step 4: Compare the atomic numbers.

      Since oxygen has a higher atomic number (8) compared to nitrogen (7), oxygen
      has a higher atomic number than nitrogen.


      Final answer: Oxygen has a higher atomic number than nitrogen.'

      of reasoning to determine which element has a higher atomic number between nitrogen
      and oxygen.


      Step 1: Understand what the atomic number is.

      The atomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. It is
      a fundamental property of an element and is used to identify the element.


      Step 2: Compare the position of nitrogen and oxygen in the periodic table.

      Nitrogen (N) has the atomic number 7, and oxygen (O) has the atomic number 8.


      Step 3: Analyze the relationship between the atomic number and the position
      in the periodic table.

      The periodic table is arranged in order of increasing atomic number, with the
      lightest element, hydrogen, having an atomic number of 1, and the heaviest known
      element, oganesson, having an atomic number of 118.


      Step 4: Draw the conclusion.

      Since oxygen has a higher atomic number (8) compared to nitrogen (7), oxygen
      has a higher atomic number than nitrogen.
