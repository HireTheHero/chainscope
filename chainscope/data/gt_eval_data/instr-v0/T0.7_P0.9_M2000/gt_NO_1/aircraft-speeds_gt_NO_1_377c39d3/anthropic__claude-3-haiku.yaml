      the F-14 Tomcat and the Eurofighter Typhoon, we need to go through a step-by-step
      reasoning process.


      Step 1: Gather information about the top speeds of each aircraft.

      - The F-14 Tomcat has a top speed of Mach 2.34, which is approximately 1,544
      mph (2,485 km/h) at high altitude.

      - The Eurofighter Typhoon has a top speed of Mach 2.0, which is approximately
      1,320 mph (2,125 km/h) at high altitude.


      Step 2: Compare the top speeds of the two aircraft.

      - The F-14 Tomcat has a higher top speed of Mach 2.34 compared to the Eurofighter
      Typhoon''s top speed of Mach 2.0.


      Step 3: Conclude which aircraft is faster.

      Based on the information gathered, the F-14 Tomcat is the faster aircraft between
      the two, with a top speed of Mach 2.34 compared to the Eurofighter Typhoon''s
      top speed of Mach 2.0.
