      Silver and aluminum are both metals, and their intermolecular forces are primarily

      the following steps:


      Step 1: Understand the relationship between intermolecular forces and boiling
      point.

      The boiling point of a substance is directly related to the strength of the
      intermolecular forces between its molecules. Substances with stronger intermolecular
      forces generally have higher boiling points.


      Step 2: Identify the intermolecular forces present in oxygen and carbon dioxide.

      Oxygen (O2) is a nonpolar molecule, and the intermolecular forces present are
      primarily van der Waals forces, which are relatively weak.

      Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a linear, symmetric, and slightly polar molecule. The
      intermolecular forces present are primarily dipole-dipole interactions, which
      are stronger than the van der Waals forces in oxygen.


      Step 3: Compare the strength of the intermolecular forces.

      Dipole-dipole interactions, as present in carbon dioxide, are generally stronger
      than van der Waals forces, as present in oxygen.

      Step 1: Understand the nature of the substances.

      - Oxygen (O2) is a diatomic molecule, consisting of two oxygen atoms.

      - Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a triatomic molecule, consisting of one carbon atom
      and two oxygen atoms.


      Step 2: Analyze the intermolecular forces.

      - The intermolecular forces in both substances are primarily van der Waals forces,

      - However, the presence of the additional oxygen atom in carbon dioxide (CO2)
      can contribute to slightly stronger intermolecular forces compared to oxygen

      Step 3: Consider the molar masses.

      - The molar mass of oxygen (O2) is 32.00 g/mol.

      - The molar mass of carbon dioxide (CO2) is 44.01 g/mol.


      Step 4: Relate the intermolecular forces and molar masses to the boiling point.

      - Generally, as the intermolecular forces and molar mass increase, the boiling

      - Lead (Pb) is a heavy, soft, and dense metal.

      - Silver (Ag) is a lustrous, soft, and highly conductive metal.


      Step 2: Consider the periodic table trends.

      - As we move down a group in the periodic table, the atomic radius of the elements
      increases.

      - Generally, as the atomic radius increases, the boiling point of the element
      also increases.

      water, has a higher boiling point, we need to consider the intermolecular forces
      and molecular structures of these two substances.


      Step 1: Understand the intermolecular forces:

      - Ethanol (C2H5OH) has hydrogen bonding as the primary intermolecular force,
      in addition to dipole-dipole interactions and van der Waals forces.

      - Water (H2O) also has hydrogen bonding as the primary intermolecular force.


      Step 2: Compare the strength of the intermolecular forces:

      - Hydrogen bonding is a relatively strong intermolecular force, and it is the
      dominant force in both ethanol and water.

      - However, the hydrogen bonding in water is generally stronger than the hydrogen
      bonding in ethanol.


      Step 3: Relate the intermolecular forces to the boiling point:

      - The stronger the intermolecular forces, the more energy is required to overcome
      these forces and transition the substance from the liquid to the gaseous state.

      - Therefore, the substance with the stronger intermolecular forces (in this
      case, water) will have a higher boiling point.

      1. Ethanol (C2H5OH) and water (H2O) are both polar molecules, but they have
      different molecular structures and intermolecular forces.


      2. The boiling point of a substance is related to the strength of the intermolecular
      forces between the molecules. The stronger the intermolecular forces, the higher
      the boiling point.


      3. In the case of ethanol and water, the intermolecular forces are primarily
      hydrogen bonding.


      4. Water has a higher degree of hydrogen bonding compared to ethanol because
      water molecules can form four hydrogen bonds (two as a donor and two as an acceptor),
      while ethanol molecules can only form three hydrogen bonds (one as a donor and
      two as an acceptor).

      water, has a higher boiling point, we need to consider the factors that influence
      the boiling point of a substance. The boiling point of a substance is primarily
      determined by the strength of the intermolecular forces between its molecules.


      Let''s go through the step-by-step reasoning:


      Step 1: Identify the intermolecular forces present in each substance.

      - Ethanol (CH3CH2OH) has hydrogen bonding between its molecules, in addition
      to dipole-dipole interactions and van der Waals forces.

      - Water (H2O) also has hydrogen bonding between its molecules, in addition to
      dipole-dipole interactions.


      Step 2: Compare the strength of the intermolecular forces.

      - Hydrogen bonding is a relatively strong intermolecular force compared to dipole-dipole
      interactions and van der Waals forces.

      - The strength of hydrogen bonding is similar between ethanol and water.


      Step 3: Consider the molecular size and complexity.

      - Ethanol has a larger and more complex molecular structure compared to water.


      Step 4: Analyze the effect of the intermolecular forces and molecular size/complexity
      on the boiling point.

      - Stronger intermolecular forces and larger/more complex molecules generally
      result in higher boiling points.


      Final answer:

      Based on the step-by-step reasoning, water has a higher boiling point than ethanol.


      The reason is that the strength of the hydrogen bonding between water molecules
      is similar to the hydrogen bonding between ethanol molecules. However, water
      has a smaller and simpler molecular structure compared to ethanol. As a result,
      the intermolecular forces in water are able to hold the molecules together more
      strongly, leading to a higher boiling point for water compared to ethanol.'

      - Helium (He) is a noble gas, while nitrogen (N2) is a diatomic molecule.

      - Helium is a monatomic gas, meaning it has a simple atomic structure.

      - Nitrogen is a diatomic gas, meaning it has a more complex molecular structure.


      Step 2: Consider the intermolecular forces between the particles.

      - Intermolecular forces are the attractive forces between the particles (atoms
      or molecules) of a substance.

      - Helium, being a monatomic gas, has very weak intermolecular forces (only van
      der Waals forces).

      - The stronger the intermolecular forces, the higher the boiling point of a
      substance.

      - Substances with stronger intermolecular forces require more energy to overcome
      those forces and transition from the liquid to the gas phase, resulting in a

      The boiling point of a substance is directly related to the strength of the
