      \ recall that boiling point is related to the intermolecular forces between\
      \ molecules.\n\n2. Both nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2) are diatomic molecules.\n\
      \n3. These molecules are held together by weak intermolecular forces called\
      \ London dispersion forces.\n\n4. The strength of these forces depends on the\
      \ size and polarizability of the molecule.\n\n5. Let's compare the molecules:\n\
      \   \u2022 Nitrogen (N2) has a molecular weight of 28\n   \u2022 Oxygen (O2)\
      \ has a molecular weight of 32\n\n6. Heavier molecules tend to have stronger\
      \ London dispersion forces because:\n   \u2022 They have more electrons\n  \
      \ \u2022 More electrons mean more temporary dipoles can form\n   \u2022 Stronger\
      \ intermolecular forces require more energy to break\n\n7. Since oxygen is slightly\
      \ heavier than nitrogen, it will have slightly stronger intermolecular forces.\n\
      \n8. Stronger intermolecular forces mean a higher boiling point.\n\nTherefore,\
      \ oxygen has a higher boiling point than nitrogen.\n\n(For reference, the actual\
      \ boiling points are: \nNitrogen: -195.8\xB0C\nOxygen: -183\xB0C, which confirms\
      \ our reasoning)"
