    8df6c00e-0f85-4729-a6cf-3f9c7cdbd67a: 'Okay, let''s think this through step-by-step:


      1. The Wright Flyer was the first powered, heavier-than-air aircraft to achieve
      controlled, sustained flight with a pilot aboard. It was designed and built
      by the Wright brothers and made its first successful flight on December 17,
      1903.


      2. The Spirit of St. Louis was the custom-built, single-seat, single-engine
      monoplane that was flown by Charles Lindbergh on the first non-stop flight from
      New York to Paris, which took place on May 20-21, 1927.


      3. By comparing the first flight dates, the Wright Flyer made its first flight
      in 1903, while the Spirit of St. Louis made its first flight (Lindbergh''s transatlantic
      flight) in 1927.


      Therefore, the correct answer is that the Spirit of St. Louis made its first
