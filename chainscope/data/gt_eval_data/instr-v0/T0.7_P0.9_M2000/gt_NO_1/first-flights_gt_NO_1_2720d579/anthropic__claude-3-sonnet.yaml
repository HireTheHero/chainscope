      The Spirit of St. Louis was a single-engine monoplane designed and built by
      Ryan Airlines for Charles Lindbergh''s non-stop solo flight across the Atlantic
      Ocean in 1927. It made its first flight on May 14, 1927.


      The Douglas DC-3 (or Douglas Commercial 3) was a propeller-driven airliner that
      revolutionized air travel in the 1930s and 1940s. It made its first flight on
      December 17, 1935.


      Step 3: Compare the first flight dates of the two aircraft.

      The Spirit of St. Louis made its first flight on May 14, 1927.

      The DC-3 made its first flight on December 17, 1935.


      Step 4: Determine which aircraft made its first flight later.

      Since December 17, 1935 (the first flight date of the DC-3) is later than May
      14, 1927 (the first flight date of the Spirit of St. Louis), the DC-3 made its
      first flight later than the Spirit of St. Louis.

      - The B-52 Stratofortress made its first flight on April 15, 1952.

      - The SR-71 Blackbird made its first flight on December 22, 1964.


      Step 3: Compare the first flight dates.

      The B-52 Stratofortress first flew in 1952, while the SR-71 Blackbird first
      flew in 1964.


      Step 4: Determine which aircraft made its first flight later.

      Since 1964 is later than 1952, the SR-71 Blackbird made its first flight later
      than the B-52 Stratofortress.


      Final Answer: The SR-71 Blackbird made its first flight later than the B-52
      Stratofortress.'

      Step 1: Understand the question.

      The question is asking which of the two aircraft, the B-52 Stratofortress or
      the SR-71 Blackbird, made its first flight later in time.


      Step 2: Gather information about the first flight of each aircraft.

      The B-52 Stratofortress first flew on April 15, 1952.

      The SR-71 Blackbird first flew on December 22, 1964.

      Step 3: Recall the significance of the Spirit of St. Louis.

      The Spirit of St. Louis was a single-engine monoplane designed and built by
      Ryan Airlines for Charles Lindbergh''s historic non-stop solo flight across
      the Atlantic Ocean in 1927.


      Step 4: Compare the first flight dates of the two aircraft.

      The Wright Flyer made its first flight in 1903, while the Spirit of St. Louis
      made its first flight in 1927.


      Step 5: Determine which aircraft made its first flight later.

      Since the Spirit of St. Louis made its first flight in 1927, which is later
      than the Wright Flyer''s first flight in 1903, the Spirit of St. Louis made
      its first flight later.


      Final Answer: The Spirit of St. Louis made its first flight later than the Wright
      Flyer.'

      these steps:


      Step 1: Identify the two aircraft mentioned in the question.

      The two aircraft are the Wright Flyer and the Spirit of St. Louis.


      Step 2: Recall the historical context and significance of each aircraft.

      The Wright Flyer was the first successful heavier-than-air powered aircraft,
      designed and built by the Wright brothers, Wilbur and Orville Wright. It made
      its first flight on December 17, 1903, at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.


      The Spirit of St. Louis was a custom-built, single-engine, single-seat monoplane
      that was flown by Charles Lindbergh on the first solo non-stop transatlantic
      flight from Long Island, New York, to Paris, France, in May 1927.


      Step 3: Compare the first flight dates of the two aircraft.

      The Wright Flyer made its first flight on December 17, 1903.

      The Spirit of St. Louis made its first flight in May 1927.


      Step 4: Determine which aircraft made its first flight later based on the dates.

      Since the Spirit of St. Louis made its first flight in May 1927, which is later
      than December 17, 1903 (the first flight of the Wright Flyer), the Spirit of
      St. Louis made its first flight later.


      Final answer: The Spirit of St. Louis made its first flight later than the Wright
      Flyer.'
    9e6fce2f-83ac-4423-923c-11e088d1900d: 'Sure, let''s break it down step-by-step:


      Step 1: Identify the aircraft mentioned in the question.

      The two aircraft mentioned are the Wright Flyer and the Spirit of St. Louis.


      Step 2: Determine the first flight dates of each aircraft.

      The Wright Flyer made its first flight on December 17, 1903. It was the first
      successful powered, heavier-than-air aircraft designed and built by the Wright
      brothers.


      The Spirit of St. Louis was a single-engine, single-seat, high-wing monoplane
      that was designed for Charles Lindbergh''s historic non-stop flight from New
      York to Paris in 1927. Its first flight was on April 28, 1927.


      Step 3: Compare the first flight dates of the two aircraft.

      The Wright Flyer''s first flight (December 17, 1903) occurred much earlier than
      the Spirit of St. Louis'' first flight (April 28, 1927).


      Step 4: Provide the final answer based on the comparison.

      The Spirit of St. Louis made its first flight later than the Wright Flyer.'

      The Wright Flyer made its first flight on December 17, 1903.

      The Spirit of St. Louis made its first flight on May 20, 1927.


      Step 4: Determine which aircraft made its first flight later.

      By comparing the first flight dates, it is evident that the Spirit of St. Louis
      made its first flight later than the Wright Flyer.


      Final Answer: The Spirit of St. Louis made its first flight later than the Wright
      Flyer.'
