      - Boeing 787 first flew on December 15, 2009


      2. Comparing these dates:

      - 2009 comes after 2005

      - Even if we look at the months, December 2009 is clearly later than April 2005


      Therefore, the Boeing 787 made its first flight later than the Airbus A380.


      Final answer: Boeing 787'
