      suggests that it was developed and first flown sometime in the late 1930s or
      early 1940s.


      Step 2: Identify the era of the B-52 Stratofortress.

      The B-52 Stratofortress is a long-range, subsonic, strategic bomber aircraft.
      It is known to have been in service during the Cold War era, which began after
      World War II and lasted until the early 1990s. This indicates that the B-52
      was developed and first flown sometime after World War II.


      Step 3: Compare the eras of the two aircraft.

      Based on the information from steps 1 and 2, we can conclude that the B-52 Stratofortress
      was developed and likely made its first flight later than the P-51 Mustang,
      as the B-52 is associated with the post-World War II era, while the P-51 was
      used during World War II.


      Final answer: The B-52 Stratofortress made its first flight later than the P-51
      Mustang.'

      1. The Boeing 737 and 747 are both commercial airliners manufactured by Boeing.


      2. The Boeing 737 is a narrow-body airliner, typically used for short to medium-haul
      flights. It''s smaller than the Boeing 747.


      3. The Boeing 747, on the other hand, is a wide-body airliner, often referred
      to as the "Jumbo Jet." It''s used for long-haul flights and has a much larger
      passenger capacity than the 737.


      4. Generally, in the development of aircraft, smaller and less complex planes
      are designed and manufactured before larger, more complex ones.


      5. Therefore, it''s likely that the smaller Boeing 737 made its first flight
      before the larger and more complex Boeing 747.


      6. To confirm, I would need to look up the specific first flight dates of each
      aircraft.


      After looking up the information:

      - The Boeing 737 made its first flight on April 9, 1967.

      - The Boeing 747 made its first flight on February 9, 1969.

      1. The Boeing 737 and Boeing 747 are both well-known commercial airliners.


      2. The Boeing 737 is a narrow-body, short- to medium-range aircraft, while the
      Boeing 747 is a wide-body, long-range aircraft.


      3. Generally, smaller and shorter-range aircraft are developed before larger,
      long-range aircraft due to technological and market demands.


      4. The Boeing 737 is part of the Boeing 7x7 series, which started with the Boeing
      707 in the 1950s. The 737 would have likely been developed after the 707 but
      before the 747.


      5. The Boeing 747 was developed in the late 1960s as a response to the growing
      demand for high-capacity, long-range air travel.


      Final answer: Based on the reasoning above, the Boeing 747 likely made its first
      flight later than the Boeing 737. The 737, being a smaller, shorter-range aircraft,
      would have been developed and flown earlier in the Boeing 7x7 series timeline,
