      the Empire State Building or 30 Hudson Yards, let''s follow a step-by-step approach:


      Step 1: Find the height of the Empire State Building.

      The Empire State Building, located in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, was
      completed in 1931. It stands at a height of 1,454 feet (443.2 meters), including
      its antenna spire.


      Step 2: Find the height of 30 Hudson Yards.

      30 Hudson Yards, also known as the North Tower, is a skyscraper in the Hudson
      Yards development in Manhattan, New York City. It was completed in 2019. The
      building stands at a height of 1,268 feet (387 meters).


      Step 3: Compare the heights of the two skyscrapers.

      Empire State Building: 1,454 feet (443.2 meters)

      30 Hudson Yards: 1,268 feet (387 meters)


      The Empire State Building is 186 feet (56.2 meters) taller than 30 Hudson Yards.


      Final answer: The Empire State Building is taller than 30 Hudson Yards.'

      step:


      1. The Bank of America Tower is a modern skyscraper located in New York City.
      It was completed in 2009.


      2. The Empire State Building is an iconic skyscraper also located in New York
      City. It was completed in 1931.


      3. Skyscrapers have generally gotten taller over time as construction techniques
      and materials have improved. So, a more recently built skyscraper is likely
      to be taller than an older one.


      4. However, the Empire State Building was famous for being the world''s tallest
      building for many years. It held this title from 1931 until 1970. So, it was
      exceptionally tall for its time.


      5. After some research, I found that the Bank of America Tower has a height
      of 1,200 feet (365.8 meters), while the Empire State Building has a height of
      1,454 feet (443.2 meters) including its antenna.


      Final answer: Despite being built more recently, the Bank of America Tower is
