      1. First, let me recall the heights of both buildings:

      - Willis Tower (formerly Sears Tower) in Chicago is 442 meters (1,451 feet)
      tall to its architectural top

      - Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia are 451.9 meters (1,483 feet) tall


      2. Converting both to the same unit (meters):

      - Willis Tower: 442 meters

      - Petronas Towers: 451.9 meters


      3. Comparing the numbers:

      451.9 > 442

      - The Chrysler Building (New York City, USA) is 318.9 meters (1,046 feet) tall


      2. Now I can directly compare these heights:

      - 318.9 meters > 309.6 meters

      - 1,046 feet > 1,016 feet


      Therefore, the Chrysler Building is taller than The Shard by about 9.3 meters
      (30 feet).


      Final answer: The Chrysler Building is taller.'
