      1. First, let me recall when each device was released:

      - The original iPod was released in October 2001

      - The original iPhone was released in June 2007


      2. Looking at these dates:

      - 2001 comes before 2007

      - Therefore, the iPod came out about 6 years before the iPhone


      3. The question asks which was released later:

      - "Later" means more recent in time

      - 2007 is more recent than 2001


      Therefore, the Apple iPhone was released later than the Apple iPod.

      1. First, let me recall when Windows 95 was released:

      - As the name suggests, Windows 95 was released in 1995

      - Specifically, it was released in August 1995


      2. Now, let me recall when the original PlayStation was released:

      - The PlayStation was first released in Japan in December 1994

      - It was released in North America in September 1995

      - It was released in Europe in September 1995


      3. Comparing the dates:

      - PlayStation: First release in December 1994

      * Sony Walkman was released in July 1979


      2. Comparing the dates:

      * 1977 comes before 1979

      * Therefore, Apple II came out first, and Sony Walkman came out later


      3. Double checking:

      * The time difference is about 2 years

      * Apple II: 1977

      * Walkman: 1979 (later)


      Final answer: The Sony Walkman was released later than the Apple II.'
