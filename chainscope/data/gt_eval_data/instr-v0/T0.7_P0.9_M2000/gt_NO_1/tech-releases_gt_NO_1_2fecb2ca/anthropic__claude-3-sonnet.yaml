      Step 1: Understand what VHS Player and Apple II are.

      - VHS Player is a device that plays VHS tapes, a popular home video format in
      the late 20th century.

      - Apple II is one of the earliest personal computers, released by Apple Inc.


      Step 2: Determine the release years of VHS Player and Apple II.

      - The VHS format was introduced in 1976, and VHS players became available to
      consumers in 1977.

      - The Apple II was released in 1977.


      Step 3: Compare the release years.

      - The VHS Player and the Apple II were both released in 1977.


      Step 4: Determine which one was released later, even if it''s just by a few
      months.

      - Since both the VHS Player and the Apple II were released in 1977, we need
      to look at the specific release dates to determine which one came later.

      - The Apple II was introduced on April 16, 1977.

      - The first VHS Player (the Victor HR-3300) was released in Japan in late 1976
      and then in the United States in August 1977.

      The two technologies mentioned are Xerox Alto and VHS Player.


      Step 2: Understand what each technology is.

      Xerox Alto was an early personal computer developed by Xerox Corporation at
      their Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) in the 1970s. It was a pioneering system
      that introduced many features that later became standard in personal computers,
      such as a graphical user interface (GUI), a mouse, and Ethernet networking.


      VHS (Video Home System) is a consumer-level analog recording videocassette standard
      developed by Victor Company of Japan (JVC) in the late 1970s. The VHS player
      was a device that could play back pre-recorded VHS videocassettes on a television
      set.


      Step 3: Determine the release years of each technology.

      The Xerox Alto was introduced in 1973, although it was not commercially available
      and was primarily used for research purposes at PARC.


      The first VHS player, the Victor HR-3300, was introduced in Japan in late 1976
      and was later released in the United States in 1977.


      Step 4: Compare the release years and determine which technology came later.
