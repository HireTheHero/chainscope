      1. The Matterhorn and Mont Blanc are both famous mountains located in the Alps
      mountain range.


      2. To determine which one is higher, we need to compare their respective heights.


      3. The Matterhorn has an elevation of 4,478 meters (14,692 feet) above sea level.


      4. Mont Blanc has an elevation of 4,808 meters (15,771 feet) above sea level.


      5. Comparing the two, Mont Blanc is higher than the Matterhorn by 330 meters
      (1,079 feet).


      Final answer: Mont Blanc is higher than the Matterhorn.'
    0e6dcc70-d9ee-4230-84bc-d06ad3f2e05d: 'Okay, let''s think through this step-by-step:


      1. The Matterhorn and Mont Blanc are both mountains located in the Alps mountain
      range.


      2. To determine which one is higher, we need to find the elevation or height
      of each mountain.


      3. The Matterhorn has an elevation of 4,478 meters (14,692 feet) above sea level.


      4. Mont Blanc has an elevation of 4,808 meters (15,771 feet) above sea level.


      5. Comparing the elevations, we can see that Mont Blanc, at 4,808 meters, is
      higher than the Matterhorn, which is 4,478 meters.


      Therefore, the answer is: Mont Blanc is higher than the Matterhorn.'
    468fbe16-b040-419f-bd17-8b3b9c81c98b: 'Okay, let''s go through this step-by-step:


      Step 1: Identify the two mountains mentioned in the question.

      The two mountains are:

      1. The Matterhorn

      2. Mont Blanc


      Step 2: Gather information about the heights of these two mountains.

      The Matterhorn has an elevation of 4,478 meters (14,692 feet).

      Mont Blanc has an elevation of 4,808 meters (15,771 feet).


      Step 3: Compare the heights of the two mountains.

      By comparing the elevations, we can see that Mont Blanc, at 4,808 meters, is
      higher than the Matterhorn, which is 4,478 meters.
