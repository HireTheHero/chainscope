      1. First, let me recall what I know about these mountains:

      - Both are in the Alps

      - The Matterhorn is on the border between Switzerland and Italy

      - Mont Blanc is on the border between France and Italy

      - Mont Blanc is the highest peak in Western Europe


      2. Let me recall their heights:

      - The Matterhorn is approximately 4,478 meters (14,692 feet)

      - Mont Blanc is approximately 4,809 meters (15,778 feet)


      3. Comparing the numbers:

      4,809 m > 4,478 m

      The difference is about 331 meters


      Therefore, Mont Blanc is higher than the Matterhorn.'

      2. Now I can directly compare these heights:

      4,809m > 4,478m


      3. The difference is about 331 meters (Mont Blanc being higher)


      Therefore, Mont Blanc is the higher mountain of the two.'
