    099245e5-0fbe-4dfd-b837-ebb6e30b4efe: 'Sure, let''s break it down step-by-step:


      Step 1: Identify the two mountains in question.

      The Matterhorn and Mont Blanc are both mountains in the Alps mountain range,
      located between Switzerland, Italy, and France.


      Step 2: Determine the elevation (height) of each mountain.

      The Matterhorn has an elevation of 4,478 meters (14,692 feet) above sea level.

      Mont Blanc has an elevation of 4,808 meters (15,771 feet) above sea level.


      Step 3: Compare the elevations of the two mountains.

      Mont Blanc, with an elevation of 4,808 meters, is higher than the Matterhorn,
      which has an elevation of 4,478 meters.


      Final Answer: Mont Blanc is higher than the Matterhorn.'
    0ee9e201-7788-45cf-a7b5-3f0131a6ca79: 'Sure, let''s break it down step-by-step:


      Step 1: Identify the mountains in question.

      The Matterhorn and Mont Blanc are both famous mountains in the Alps mountain
      range, located in Europe.


      Step 2: Understand the question.

      The question is asking which of these two mountains has a higher elevation or
      altitude.


      Step 3: Gather information about the elevations of the two mountains.

      The Matterhorn has an elevation of 4,478 meters (14,692 feet) above sea level.

      Mont Blanc has an elevation of 4,808 meters (15,771 feet) above sea level.


      Step 4: Compare the elevations.

      By comparing the elevations, we can see that Mont Blanc, at 4,808 meters, has
      a higher elevation than the Matterhorn, which is 4,478 meters.


      Step 5: Formulate the final answer.

      Based on the information gathered and the comparison made, the final answer
      is:


      Mont Blanc is higher than the Matterhorn.'
    1992e623-fee2-4e96-bcce-ffb8ca2629e9: 'To answer this question, let''s follow
      a step-by-step reasoning process:

      Step 1: Identify the mountains mentioned in the question.

      The two mountains mentioned are Mount Fuji and Mount Whitney.


      Step 2: Gather information about the elevation of each mountain.

      Mount Fuji is a stratovolcano located in Japan. Its elevation is 3,776 meters
      (12,388 feet) above sea level.

      Mount Whitney is the highest summit in the contiguous United States and the
