    d2583b50-857d-4fc8-a538-52f0b83c1c08: 'To determine which bridge is longer between
      the George Washington Bridge and the Brooklyn Bridge, we can follow these steps:


      Step 1: Gather the relevant information about the lengths of the two bridges.

      - George Washington Bridge: The George Washington Bridge is a double-decked
      suspension bridge that connects the borough of Manhattan in New York City to
      Fort Lee, New Jersey across the Hudson River. The total length of the George
      Washington Bridge is 4,760 meters (15,600 feet).

      - Brooklyn Bridge: The Brooklyn Bridge is a hybrid cable-stayed/suspension bridge
      that connects the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn in New York City across
      the East River. The total length of the Brooklyn Bridge is 1,825 meters (5,989
      feet).


      Step 2: Compare the lengths of the two bridges.

      By comparing the total lengths, we can see that the George Washington Bridge,
      with a length of 4,760 meters (15,600 feet), is significantly longer than the
      Brooklyn Bridge, which has a length of 1,825 meters (5,989 feet).


      Step 3: Provide the final answer.

      Based on the information gathered, the George Washington Bridge is longer than
      the Brooklyn Bridge.'
