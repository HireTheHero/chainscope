      a step-by-step reasoning process:


      Step 1: Gather information about the length of each bridge.

      The Chesapeake Bay Bridge is a bridge-tunnel system that spans the Chesapeake
      Bay, connecting the Delmarva Peninsula with mainland Virginia. Its total length,
      including the bridge portions and the tunnel sections, is approximately 17.6
      miles (28.3 kilometers).


      The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge is a complex of bridges spanning the San
      Francisco Bay, connecting San Francisco with Oakland and the East Bay region.
      Its total length, including the western and eastern spans, is approximately
      8.4 miles (13.5 kilometers).


      Step 2: Compare the lengths of the two bridges.

      The Chesapeake Bay Bridge has a total length of approximately 17.6 miles (28.3
      kilometers), while the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge has a total length of
      approximately 8.4 miles (13.5 kilometers).


      Step 3: Determine which bridge is longer based on the comparison.

      Since the Chesapeake Bay Bridge has a greater total length of 17.6 miles compared
      to the 8.4 miles of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, it is evident that
      the Chesapeake Bay Bridge is longer.

      - Seven Mile Bridge is a series of bridges in the Florida Keys, connecting Knight''s
      Key to Little Duck Key.


      Step 2: Determine the length of each bridge.

      - The Mackinac Bridge has a total length of 26,372 feet (approximately 5 miles
      or 8 km).

      - The Seven Mile Bridge is a series of bridges with a total length of 35,862
      feet (approximately 6.8 miles or 10.9 km).


      Step 3: Compare the lengths of the two bridges.

      - The Seven Mile Bridge, with a total length of 35,862 feet (6.8 miles or 10.9
      km), is longer than the Mackinac Bridge, which has a total length of 26,372
      feet (5 miles or 8 km).

      Step 1: Identify the bridges in question.

      The bridges mentioned are the Mackinac Bridge and the Seven Mile Bridge.


      Step 2: Gather information about the length of each bridge.

      The Mackinac Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Straits of Mackinac
      between Michigan''s Upper and Lower Peninsulas. Its total length is approximately
      8,614 feet (2,625 meters).


      The Seven Mile Bridge is a famous bridge in the Florida Keys, connecting Knight''s
      Key (in the Middle Keys) to Little Duck Key (in the Lower Keys). Its total length
      is approximately 6.79 miles (10.93 kilometers), which is equivalent to 35,719
      feet (10,887 meters).
