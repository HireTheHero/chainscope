      1. First, let me recall the lengths of these bridges:

      - Confederation Bridge (connects Prince Edward Island to New Brunswick, Canada)
      is 12.9 kilometers (8 miles) long

      - Lake Pontchartrain Causeway (in Louisiana, USA) is 38.4 kilometers (23.8 miles)
      long


      2. To compare:

      - 38.4 km > 12.9 km

      - 23.8 miles > 8 miles


      3. The comparison is straightforward since both measurements (whether in kilometers
      or miles) show the same result.


      Therefore, the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway is longer than the Confederation
      Bridge by a significant margin - about three times longer.


      Final answer: Lake Pontchartrain Causeway is longer.'

      - Its total length is 4,760 feet (1,450 m)


      2. Now, let me recall the facts about the Brooklyn Bridge:

      - The Brooklyn Bridge connects Manhattan to Brooklyn

      - It spans the East River

      - Its total length is 5,989 feet (1,825 m)


      3. Now I can compare:

      - Brooklyn Bridge: 5,989 feet

      - George Washington Bridge: 4,760 feet

      - 5,989 > 4,760


      Therefore, the Brooklyn Bridge is longer than the George Washington Bridge by
      about 1,229 feet.


      Final answer: The Brooklyn Bridge is longer.'
    1f915ce8-633e-4834-a171-7f3e9b01f92d: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. Let me recall the lengths of both bridges:

      * George Washington Bridge is approximately 4,760 feet (1,451 meters) long

      * Brooklyn Bridge is approximately 5,989 feet (1,825 meters) long


      2. Now I can directly compare these lengths:

      * 5,989 feet > 4,760 feet

      * 1,825 meters > 1,451 meters


      3. The comparison shows that the Brooklyn Bridge is longer by about:

      * 5,989 - 4,760 = 1,229 feet

      * 1,825 - 1,451 = 374 meters


      Final answer: The Brooklyn Bridge is longer than the George Washington Bridge.'

      2. Converting both to the same unit (feet):

      - George Washington Bridge: 4,760 feet

      - Brooklyn Bridge: 5,989 feet


      3. Comparing the numbers:

      5,989 > 4,760

    8bf81e00-87bd-45e4-a2eb-bd89c1adfa24: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, let me recall the locations of these bridges:

      - George Washington Bridge connects Manhattan to New Jersey across the Hudson
      River

      - Brooklyn Bridge connects Manhattan to Brooklyn across the East River


      2. Consider the width of the rivers they cross:

      - The Hudson River is significantly wider than the East River

      - The Hudson River at this point is approximately 4,000 feet wide

      - The East River is approximately 1,600 feet wide


      3. Looking up the actual lengths:

      - George Washington Bridge: 4,760 feet (total length)

      - Brooklyn Bridge: 5,989 feet (total length)


      4. Even though the Hudson River is wider, the Brooklyn Bridge has longer approaches
      on both sides, making its total length greater.


      Final Answer: The Brooklyn Bridge is longer than the George Washington Bridge.'
