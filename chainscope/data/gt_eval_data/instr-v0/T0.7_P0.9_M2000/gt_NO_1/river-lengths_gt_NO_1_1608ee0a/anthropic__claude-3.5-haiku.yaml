      \ running through several countries like Switzerland, Germany, and the Netherlands\n\
      \u2022 Colorado River is in North America, running through the United States\
      \ and part of Mexico\n\n2. Now, let's consider their lengths:\n\u2022 River\
      \ Rhine: Approximately 1,232 kilometers (765 miles) long\n\u2022 Colorado River:\
      \ Approximately 2,330 kilometers (1,450 miles) long\n\n3. Comparing the lengths:\n\
      \u2022 The Colorado River is almost twice as long as the River Rhine\n\u2022\
      \ 2,330 km > 1,232 km\n\n4. Additional context:\n\u2022 The Colorado River is\
      \ known for carving the Grand Canyon and passing through several U.S. states\n\
      \u2022 The Rhine is an important commercial and cultural river in Europe, but\
      \ shorter in length\n\nTherefore, the Colorado River is longer than the River\
      \ Rhine.\n\nFinal answer: Colorado River"
