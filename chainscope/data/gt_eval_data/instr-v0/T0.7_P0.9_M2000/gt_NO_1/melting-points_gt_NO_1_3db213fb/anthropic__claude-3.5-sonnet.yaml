      \n1) Melting point is related to how strongly atoms are held together in a solid\n\
      \n2) Both copper and iron are metals, so they have metallic bonding\n\n3) The\
      \ strength of metallic bonding depends on:\n   - Number of outer electrons available\
      \ for bonding\n   - Size of the atomic nucleus/nuclear charge\n\n4) Iron is\
      \ element 26 (Fe), copper is element 29 (Cu)\n   - Iron has 2 outer electrons\
      \ in 4s and 6 in 3d = 8 valence electrons\n   - Copper has 1 outer electron\
      \ in 4s and 10 in 3d = 11 valence electrons\n\n5) Despite copper having more\
      \ electrons, iron forms stronger metallic bonds because:\n   - Iron can share\
      \ more unpaired electrons\n   - Iron has a more optimal electron configuration\
      \ for bonding\n\n6) Looking up the actual values confirms this:\n   - Iron melting\
      \ point: 1538\xB0C\n   - Copper melting point: 1085\xB0C\n\nTherefore, iron\
      \ has a higher melting point than copper."
