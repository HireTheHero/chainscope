      Step 1: Understand the concept of density.

      Density is a measure of the mass per unit volume of a substance. It is calculated

      1. Density is a measure of the mass per unit volume of a substance.


      2. To compare the densities of gold and platinum, we need to look at their respective
      masses and volumes.


      3. Gold has an atomic number of 79 and an atomic weight of 196.97 g/mol.

      Platinum has an atomic number of 78 and an atomic weight of 195.08 g/mol.


      4. The atomic weights suggest that gold has a slightly higher atomic mass compared
      to platinum.


      5. However, the atomic number of gold is higher than platinum, which means gold
      has more protons and electrons in its atoms.


      6. Generally, the more protons and electrons an atom has, the denser the substance
      will be.


      7. Therefore, based on the higher atomic number of gold compared to platinum,
      we can conclude that gold is denser than platinum.


      Final answer: Gold is denser than platinum.'

      1. Lithium and potassium are both alkali metals, belonging to the same group
      (Group 1) in the periodic table.


      2. As we move down a group in the periodic table, the atomic radius of the elements
      increases. This is because the number of electron shells increases as you go
      down the group.


      3. Density is related to the atomic mass and atomic radius of an element. Density
      = mass / volume. Since the atomic radius increases down the group, the volume
      of the atoms increases.


      4. However, the atomic mass also increases as you go down the group. Lithium
      has an atomic mass of 6.94 g/mol, while potassium has an atomic mass of 39.10
      g/mol.


      5. Comparing the atomic masses, potassium has a significantly higher atomic
      mass than lithium.


      6. Therefore, even though potassium has a larger atomic radius than lithium,
      the increase in atomic mass outweighs the increase in volume, making potassium
      denser than lithium.

      Since the molar mass of magnesium (24.31 g/mol) is higher than the molar mass
      of sodium (22.99 g/mol), and the atomic radius of magnesium (160 pm) is smaller
      than the atomic radius of sodium (186 pm), the density of magnesium will be
      higher than the density of sodium.


      Therefore, the conclusion is that magnesium is denser than sodium.'

      1. Density is a measure of the mass per unit volume of a substance.


      2. To compare the densities of lead and mercury, we need to look at their respective
      densities.


      3. The density of lead is 11.34 g/cm^3.

      4. The density of mercury is 13.53 g/cm^3.


      5. Since the density of mercury (13.53 g/cm^3) is greater than the density of
      lead (11.34 g/cm^3), this means that mercury is denser than lead.


      Therefore, the final answer is that mercury is denser than lead.'
