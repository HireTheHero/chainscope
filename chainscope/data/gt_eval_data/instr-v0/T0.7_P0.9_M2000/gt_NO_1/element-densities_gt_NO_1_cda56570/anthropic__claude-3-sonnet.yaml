      It is calculated by dividing the mass of a substance by its volume.


      Step 2: Identify the atomic masses of potassium and sodium.

      The atomic mass of potassium (K) is 39.10 atomic mass units (amu).

      The atomic mass of sodium (Na) is 22.99 amu.


      Step 3: Consider the atomic structure and arrangement of atoms.

      Both potassium and sodium are solid metals at room temperature. In their solid
      states, their atoms are arranged in a compact crystalline structure.


      Step 4: Compare the atomic masses.

      Since both substances are in the solid state and have similar atomic arrangements,

    803580af-0782-4bc0-9629-92c66bba33d6: 'To determine which substance is denser
      between potassium and sodium, we need to follow these steps:


      Step 1: Understand the concept of density.

      Density is a measure of how much mass is contained in a given volume of a substance.
      It is calculated by dividing the mass of the substance by its volume.


      Step 2: Identify the atomic masses and atomic radii of potassium and sodium.

      Potassium (K) has an atomic mass of 39.10 u (unified atomic mass units) and
      an atomic radius of 227 pm (picometers).

      Sodium (Na) has an atomic mass of 22.99 u and an atomic radius of 186 pm.


      Step 3: Compare the atomic masses and atomic radii.

      The atomic mass of potassium is higher than that of sodium, which suggests that
      potassium has more mass per atom.

      However, the atomic radius of potassium is also larger than that of sodium,
      which means that the volume occupied by a potassium atom is greater than the
      volume occupied by a sodium atom.


      Step 4: Consider the relationship between mass, volume, and density.

      Density is directly proportional to mass and inversely proportional to volume.
      A higher mass and a smaller volume result in a higher density.


      Step 5: Analyze the relative densities based on the information gathered.

      Since potassium has a higher atomic mass but also a larger atomic radius compared
      to sodium, it is not immediately obvious which one has a higher density.


      Now, based on the steps taken, we can provide the final answer:


      The final answer is that sodium (Na) is denser than potassium (K).


      This is because, although potassium has a higher atomic mass, the smaller atomic
      radius of sodium atoms allows them to pack more tightly together, resulting
      in a higher density for sodium compared to potassium.'

      between lithium and potassium, we need to follow these steps:


      Step 1: Understand the concept of density.

      Density is a measure of how much mass is contained in a given volume of a substance.
      It is calculated by dividing the mass of the substance by its volume.


      Step 2: Identify the atomic masses and atomic radii of lithium and potassium.

      Lithium (Li) has an atomic mass of 6.94 u (unified atomic mass units) and an
      atomic radius of 152 pm (picometers).

      Potassium (K) has an atomic mass of 39.10 u and an atomic radius of 227 pm.


      Step 3: Compare the atomic masses.

      Potassium has a higher atomic mass than lithium, which generally indicates a
      higher density. However, atomic mass alone is not sufficient to determine density.


      Step 4: Consider the atomic radii.

      The atomic radius is related to the volume occupied by an atom. A smaller atomic
      radius typically means a denser packing of atoms in a given volume, resulting
      in a higher density.


      Step 5: Compare the atomic radii.

      Lithium has a smaller atomic radius (152 pm) compared to potassium (227 pm).
      This suggests that lithium atoms can pack more tightly in a given volume, leading
      to a higher density.


      Step 6: Combine the information from atomic mass and atomic radius.

      While potassium has a higher atomic mass, lithium''s smaller atomic radius allows
      for denser packing of atoms, which is the more significant factor in determining
      density for solid elements.


      Final answer: Based on the reasoning above, lithium is denser than potassium.'

      Step 1: Understand the concept of density

      Density is a measure of how much mass is contained in a given volume of a substance.
      It is calculated by dividing the mass of a substance by its volume.


      Step 2: Recall the atomic masses of lithium and potassium

      The atomic mass of lithium (Li) is approximately 6.94 g/mol, and the atomic
      mass of potassium (K) is approximately 39.10 g/mol.


      Step 3: Consider the atomic radii of lithium and potassium

      The atomic radius is a measure of the size of an atom. Generally, atoms with
      larger atomic radii have lower densities because their masses are distributed
      over a larger volume.


      The atomic radius of lithium is around 152 picometers (pm), while the atomic
      radius of potassium is around 227 pm.


      Step 4: Compare the atomic masses and atomic radii

      Potassium has a significantly larger atomic mass (39.10 g/mol) compared to lithium
      (6.94 g/mol). However, potassium also has a larger atomic radius (227 pm) compared
      to lithium (152 pm).


      Step 5: Determine the denser substance

      Since potassium has a larger atomic mass but also a larger atomic radius, the
      effect of the larger mass and larger volume on density needs to be evaluated.


      In this case, the increase in mass outweighs the increase in volume, making
      potassium denser than lithium.

      Step 2: Identify the atomic masses of lithium and potassium.

      The atomic mass of lithium (Li) is approximately 6.94 atomic mass units (u).

      The atomic mass of potassium (K) is approximately 39.10 atomic mass units (u).


      Step 3: Consider the atomic radii of lithium and potassium.

      The atomic radius of lithium is smaller than that of potassium. This means that

      Step 4: Relate atomic mass to density.

      The atomic mass of potassium is 39.10 u.


      Step 3: Consider the periodic trends in atomic radii.

      As we move across a period (row) in the periodic table from left to right, the
      atomic radii generally decrease. This is because the added protons in the nucleus
      increase the effective nuclear charge, pulling the electrons closer to the nucleus.


      Step 4: Compare the atomic radii of lithium and potassium.

      Lithium is the first element in the second period, while potassium is the fourth
      element in the fourth period. Since potassium is farther to the right in the

      In this case, magnesium has a higher atomic mass (24.31 u) compared to sodium
      (22.99 u).


      Step 4: Draw the conclusion.

      Based on the comparison of atomic masses, magnesium is expected to be denser
      than sodium.


      Final answer: Magnesium is denser than sodium.'
