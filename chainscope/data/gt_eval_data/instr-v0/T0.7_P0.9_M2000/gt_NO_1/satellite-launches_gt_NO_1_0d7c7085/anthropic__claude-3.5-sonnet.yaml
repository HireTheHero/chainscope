      1. First, I need to recall when each satellite was launched:

      - Voyager 2 was launched on August 20, 1977

      - GPS 1 (also known as Navstar 1) was launched on February 22, 1978


      2. Comparing these dates:

      - 1977 comes before 1978

      - Therefore, Voyager 2 was launched first


      3. Since the question asks which was launched later:

      - The satellite launched later would be the one with the more recent launch
      date

      - 1978 is more recent than 1977


      Therefore, GPS 1 was launched later than Voyager 2.
