      Step 2: Identify the launch date of the International Space Station (ISS).

      The ISS is a modular space station that has been assembled in stages. The first

      Syncom 3 was a communications satellite launched by NASA on August 19, 1964.
      It was the first geostationary satellite, meaning it orbited the Earth at the
      same speed as the Earth''s rotation, appearing to be stationary over a single
      point on the equator.


      Step 2: Research Early Bird

      Early Bird, also known as Intelsat I, was the first commercial communications
      satellite launched on April 6, 1965. It was built by Hughes Aircraft Company
      and operated by Intelsat.

      the Moon.

      - TIROS-1 (Television Infrared Observation Satellite) was the first successful
      weather satellite launched by the United States.


      Step 2: Determine the timeline of space exploration.

      - The Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, in 1957.

      - The United States followed with Explorer 1 in 1958.

      - The space race between the two nations continued through the 1950s and 1960s.


      Step 3: Consider the focus of early space exploration.

      - Early space exploration focused on the Moon, with both the United States and
      the Soviet Union aiming to achieve lunar milestones.

      - Weather satellites, like TIROS-1, were developed later as a practical application
      of satellite technology.

      1. TIROS-1 was the first weather satellite. It was launched by NASA.


      2. Telstar 1 was the first active communications satellite. It was launched
      as a collaboration between NASA, AT&T, Bell Labs, and the British and French
      postal services.


      3. The early weather satellites preceded the early communications satellites
      in development. This is because monitoring weather and Earth''s atmosphere was
      a more straightforward application of early satellite technology compared to
      active communications, which required more complex systems.


      4. Therefore, it''s likely that TIROS-1, being the first weather satellite,
      was launched before Telstar 1, which was the first active communications satellite.


      5. To confirm, I would need to look up the specific launch dates of TIROS-1
      and Telstar 1.


      After thinking it through, my answer is that Telstar 1 was likely launched later
      than TIROS-1, based on the reasoning that weather satellites preceded communications
      satellites in development. However, to be certain, I would need to verify the
      exact launch dates of these two satellites.'

      TIROS-1 (Television Infrared Observation Satellite) was the first successful
      weather satellite. It was launched by NASA on April 1, 1960.


      Step 2: Find the launch date of Telstar 1.

      Telstar 1 was a communication satellite launched by NASA in collaboration with
      Bell Telephone Laboratories and the British General Post Office. It was launched
      on July 10, 1962.


      Step 3: Compare the launch dates of TIROS-1 and Telstar 1.

      TIROS-1 was launched on April 1, 1960, while Telstar 1 was launched on July
      10, 1962. This means that Telstar 1 was launched more than two years after TIROS-1.

      - Landsat 1 was an Earth observation satellite designed to study and monitor
      Earth''s landmasses.

      - Voyager 1 is a space probe designed to study the outer solar system and interstellar
      space.


      Step 2: Consider the timeline of space exploration and satellite technology.

      - Earth observation satellites were among the first satellites launched, as
      they were essential for understanding our planet.

      - Missions to explore the outer solar system came later, after the initial focus
      on Earth and the Moon.


      Step 3: Recall the approximate launch dates, if known.

      - Landsat 1 was launched in the early 1970s (exact year: 1972).

      - Voyager 1 was launched in the late 1970s (exact year: 1977).


      Final Answer: Based on the information above, Voyager 1 was launched later than
      Landsat 1. Landsat 1 was launched in 1972, while Voyager 1 was launched in 1977,
      approximately 5 years after Landsat 1.'
