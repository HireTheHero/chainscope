      The question is asking which of the two satellites, Syncom 3 or Early Bird,
      was launched later in time.


      Step 2: Gather information about the satellites.

      Syncom 3 was a communications satellite launched by NASA on August 19, 1964.
      It was part of the Syncom series of satellites, which were designed to test
      the feasibility of geosynchronous communications satellites.


      Early Bird, also known as Intelsat 1, was the first commercial communications
      satellite launched by Intelsat (International Telecommunications Satellite Organization)
      on April 6, 1965.


      Step 3: Compare the launch dates.

      Syncom 3 was launched on August 19, 1964.

      Early Bird was launched on April 6, 1965.

      Since Early Bird was launched on April 6, 1965, and Syncom 3 was launched earlier
      on August 19, 1964, it means that Early Bird was launched later than Syncom
      3.

      The question is asking which of the two satellites, Mir or the Hubble Space
      Telescope, was launched at a later date.


      Step 2: Gather information about the launch dates of the two satellites.

      Mir was a Russian/Soviet space station that was launched in multiple modules
      between 1986 and 1996. The first module, called Mir Core Module, was launched
      on February 20, 1986.
