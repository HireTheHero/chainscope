      Vanguard 1 on March 17, 1958.


      Therefore, the answer is:

      Luna 1 was launched later than Vanguard 1.'
    5c9e7730-cd4c-45c2-9812-d9add6faf4fc: 'To determine which satellite was launched
      later, Vanguard 1 or Luna 1, let''s go through the steps of reasoning:


      Step 1: Identify the launch dates of the two satellites.

      - Vanguard 1 was launched on March 17, 1958.

      - Luna 1 was launched on January 2, 1959.


      Step 2: Compare the launch dates.

      - Vanguard 1 was launched earlier, on March 17, 1958.

      - Luna 1 was launched later, on January 2, 1959.


      Therefore, the answer is:

      Luna 1 was launched later than Vanguard 1.'
    5d0c4573-7058-4b36-8456-f874e10c7988: 'Okay, let''s go through this step-by-step:


      1. Vanguard 1 and Luna 1 are both early artificial satellites launched during
      the Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union in the late 1950s.


      2. Vanguard 1 was launched by the United States on March 17, 1958. It was the
      fourth artificial satellite to be successfully placed into Earth''s orbit.


      3. Luna 1 was launched by the Soviet Union on January 2, 1959. It was the first
      artificial satellite to escape Earth''s gravity and enter into orbit around
      the Sun.


      4. Comparing the launch dates, we can see that Luna 1 was launched later than
      Vanguard 1, by about 10 months.


      Therefore, the answer is:

      Luna 1 was launched later than Vanguard 1.'
    86e63ab1-59bf-459c-959e-c2d72300bbd1: 'Okay, let''s think this through step-by-step:


      1. Vanguard 1 and Luna 1 are both early satellites, launched in the late 1950s
      during the beginning of the space age.


      2. Vanguard 1 was launched on March 17, 1958 by the United States.


      3. Luna 1 was launched on January 2, 1959 by the Soviet Union.


      4. Comparing the launch dates, Luna 1 was launched later than Vanguard 1.


      Therefore, the answer is:

      Luna 1 was launched later than Vanguard 1.'
    ae6af605-eae8-4a2b-a43b-2eb4ab680dc1: 'Okay, let''s go through this step-by-step:


      Step 1: Identify the key information given in the question.

      - The question is asking which of two satellites, Vanguard 1 or Luna 1, was
      launched later.


      Step 2: Research the launch dates of the two satellites.

      - Vanguard 1 was launched on March 17, 1958.

      - Luna 1 was launched on January 2, 1959.


      Step 3: Compare the launch dates to determine which one was launched later.

      - Luna 1 was launched on January 2, 1959, which is later than the launch of
      Vanguard 1 on March 17, 1958.


      Final answer:

      Luna 1 was launched later than Vanguard 1.'
