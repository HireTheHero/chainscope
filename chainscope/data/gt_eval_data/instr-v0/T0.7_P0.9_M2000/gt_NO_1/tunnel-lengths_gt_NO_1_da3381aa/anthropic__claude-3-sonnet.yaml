      Step 1: Understand the question

      The question is asking which of the two tunnels, the Lincoln Tunnel or the Holland
      Tunnel, is longer in terms of its length.


      Step 2: Gather relevant information

      Both the Lincoln Tunnel and the Holland Tunnel are vehicular tunnels that connect
      Manhattan in New York City to New Jersey, passing under the Hudson River.


      Step 3: Research the lengths of the tunnels

      According to various sources:

      - The Lincoln Tunnel has a total length of approximately 1.5 miles (2.4 km).

      - The Holland Tunnel has a total length of approximately 1.6 miles (2.6 km).

      the Lincoln Tunnel and the Holland Tunnel from reliable sources.


      Step 5: Conduct any necessary research or calculations.

      After researching, I found the following information:

      - The Lincoln Tunnel has a total length of 8,216 feet (2,504 meters), consisting
      of three separate tunnels.
