      1. First, let me recall the details about both tunnels:

      - Sydney Harbour Tunnel connects Sydney CBD with North Sydney, going under Sydney
      Harbour

      - Lincoln Tunnel connects Manhattan (New York City) with New Jersey under the
      Hudson River


      2. Let me find their lengths:

      - Sydney Harbour Tunnel is 2.3 kilometers (1.4 miles) long

      - Lincoln Tunnel is 2.4 kilometers (1.5 miles) long


      3. Now I can compare:

      2.4 km > 2.3 km

    37749a40-1150-433c-9604-2dd6bb069e58: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, let me recall the details about Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line:

      - It''s a combined bridge-tunnel structure in Japan

      - The tunnel portion is approximately 9.6 km long

      - It connects Kawasaki and Kisarazu across Tokyo Bay


      2. Now, let me recall details about Mont Blanc Tunnel:

      - It''s a highway tunnel connecting France and Italy

      - It passes beneath Mont Blanc in the Alps

      - It''s approximately 11.6 km long


      3. Comparing the lengths:

      - Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line tunnel: 9.6 km

      - Mont Blanc Tunnel: 11.6 km

      - 11.6 km > 9.6 km


      Therefore, the Mont Blanc Tunnel is longer than the tunnel portion of the Tokyo
      Bay Aqua-Line.


      Final answer: Mont Blanc Tunnel is longer.'
    465ee7b0-516b-48ec-86f1-e5daf9ec018e: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, let me recall the details of both tunnels:

      * Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line is a combination bridge-tunnel system crossing Tokyo Bay
      in Japan

      * Mont Blanc Tunnel connects France and Italy through the Mont Blanc mountain
      in the Alps


      2. Let me find their lengths:

      * Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line: The tunnel portion is 9.6 km long

      * Mont Blanc Tunnel: It is 11.6 km long


      3. Comparing the numbers:

      * 11.6 km > 9.6 km

      * The Mont Blanc Tunnel is 2 km longer than the tunnel portion of the Tokyo
      Bay Aqua-Line


      Therefore, the Mont Blanc Tunnel is longer than the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line tunnel
      section.


      Final answer: Mont Blanc Tunnel is longer.'

      1. First, let me recall the key facts about Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line:

      - It crosses Tokyo Bay in Japan

      - It''s a combination of a bridge and tunnel

      - The tunnel portion is approximately 9.6 km long


      2. Now for the Mont Blanc Tunnel:

      - It connects France and Italy through the Alps

      - It''s a road tunnel under Mont Blanc mountain

      - It''s approximately 11.6 km long


      3. Comparing the lengths:

      - Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line tunnel: 9.6 km
