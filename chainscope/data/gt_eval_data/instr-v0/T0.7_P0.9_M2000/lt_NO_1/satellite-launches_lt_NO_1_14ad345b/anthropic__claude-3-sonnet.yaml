      1. Identify what Mir and GPS 1 are.

      2. Find the launch dates for Mir and GPS 1.

      3. Compare the launch dates to determine which one was launched earlier.


      Step 1: Identifying Mir and GPS 1

      - Mir was a Russian/Soviet modular space station that operated in low Earth
      orbit from 1986 to 2001.

      - GPS 1 (also known as Navstar 1) was the first operational satellite launched
      as part of the Global Positioning System (GPS) constellation.


      Step 2: Finding the launch dates

      - Mir was launched on February 19, 1986, from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.

      - GPS 1 was launched on February 22, 1978, from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station
      in Florida, United States.


      Step 3: Comparing the launch dates

      By comparing the launch dates, we can see that GPS 1 was launched on February
      22, 1978, while Mir was launched on February 19, 1986.
