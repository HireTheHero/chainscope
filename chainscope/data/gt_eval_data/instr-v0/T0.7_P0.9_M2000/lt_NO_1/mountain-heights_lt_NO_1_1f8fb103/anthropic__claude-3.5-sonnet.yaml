      1. First, I need to recall the heights of both mountains:

      - Mount Kilimanjaro is 5,895 meters (19,341 feet) above sea level

      - Mount Elbrus is 5,642 meters (18,510 feet) above sea level


      2. Now I can compare these heights:

      - 5,895 m > 5,642 m

      - The difference is about 253 meters


      3. Since the question asks which mountain is lower:

      - The lower mountain will be the one with the smaller number

      - 5,642 m (Elbrus) < 5,895 m (Kilimanjaro)


      Final answer: Mount Elbrus is lower than Mount Kilimanjaro.'
