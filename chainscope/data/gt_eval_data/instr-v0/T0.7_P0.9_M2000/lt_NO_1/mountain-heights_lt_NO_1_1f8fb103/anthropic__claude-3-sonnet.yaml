    04f09ada-9555-4bf7-96d2-d0cd3cc1ebcb: 'Sure, let''s break it down step-by-step:


      Step 1: Identify the two mountains mentioned in the question.

      The mountains are Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Elbrus.


      Step 2: Recall any prior knowledge about the heights of these mountains.

      Mount Kilimanjaro is a famous mountain in Tanzania, Africa, and is often referred
      to as the highest mountain in Africa.

      Mount Elbrus is a mountain located in Russia, near the border with Georgia,
      and is known as the highest mountain in Europe.


      Step 3: Compare the heights of the two mountains.

      According to available information:

      - Mount Kilimanjaro has a summit elevation of 5,895 meters (19,341 feet) above
      sea level.

      - Mount Elbrus has a summit elevation of 5,642 meters (18,510 feet) above sea
      level.


      Step 4: Determine which mountain is lower based on the elevation comparison.

      Since Mount Elbrus has a lower summit elevation (5,642 meters) compared to Mount
      Kilimanjaro (5,895 meters), we can conclude that Mount Elbrus is the lower of
      the two mountains.


      Final Answer: Mount Elbrus is lower than Mount Kilimanjaro.'
