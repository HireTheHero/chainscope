      2. Mount Elbrus is located in Russia, in the Caucasus Mountains. It is the highest
      mountain in Europe.


      3. To determine which mountain is lower, we need to compare their elevations.


      4. Mount Kilimanjaro has an elevation of 5,895 meters (19,341 feet) above sea
      level.


      5. Mount Elbrus has an elevation of 5,642 meters (18,510 feet) above sea level.


      6. Comparing the elevations, we can see that Mount Elbrus is 253 meters (831
      feet) lower than Mount Kilimanjaro.


      Therefore, Mount Elbrus is lower than Mount Kilimanjaro.'
    3dda8344-b0ac-4de2-a738-7847e81dbda4: 'To determine which mountain is lower between
      Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Elbrus, let''s follow these steps:


      Step 1: Identify the location of each mountain.

      - Mount Kilimanjaro is located in Tanzania, Africa.

      - Mount Elbrus is located in the Caucasus Mountains, on the border of Russia
      and Georgia, Europe.


      Step 2: Find the elevation of each mountain.

      - Mount Kilimanjaro has an elevation of 5,895 meters (19,341 feet) above sea
      level.

      - Mount Elbrus has an elevation of 5,642 meters (18,510 feet) above sea level.


      Step 3: Compare the elevations.

      - Mount Kilimanjaro: 5,895 meters (19,341 feet)

      - Mount Elbrus: 5,642 meters (18,510 feet)


      Since Mount Elbrus has a lower elevation compared to Mount Kilimanjaro, we can
      conclude that Mount Elbrus is the lower of the two mountains.

      \ mountain in the world, after Mount Everest.\n   - Mount Kangchenjunga is the\
      \ third-highest mountain in the world.\n\n3. Compare the heights:\n   - Since\
      \ Mount K2 is the second-highest and Mount Kangchenjunga is the third-highest,\
      \ we can conclude that Mount Kangchenjunga is lower than Mount K2.\n\nFinal\
