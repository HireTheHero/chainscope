      2. Now, let''s consider the periodic table. In the periodic table, elements
      are arranged in order of increasing atomic number. As we move from left to right
      across a period (row), the atomic number increases by one for each element.


      3. Nitrogen and carbon are both in the second period of the periodic table.
      Carbon is to the left of nitrogen.


      4. Since elements are arranged from left to right in order of increasing atomic

      1. First, let''s recall what atomic number means. The atomic number of an element

      2. Now, let''s consider the elements in question: nitrogen and carbon. Both
      are common elements found in many compounds, including living organisms.

      numbers of each element. We can find this information on the periodic table
      of elements.


      4. On the periodic table, elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic
      number. The atomic number is typically listed above the element''s symbol.


      5. Carbon (symbol C) is located in the second row (period) of the periodic table,

      6. Nitrogen (symbol N) is also located in the second row, but in group 15, which

      atomic number between nitrogen and carbon, let''s follow these steps:


      Step 1: Recall the definition of atomic number.

      The atomic number of an element is the number of protons in the nucleus of an
      atom of that element. It is a unique identifier for each element.


      Step 2: Recall the order of elements in the periodic table.

      In the periodic table, elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number.
      The atomic number increases from left to right across a period (row) and from
      top to bottom in a group (column).


      Step 3: Locate nitrogen and carbon in the periodic table.

      Nitrogen (symbol N) is located in period 2, group 15 (or group 5A).

      Carbon (symbol C) is located in period 2, group 14 (or group 4A).


      Step 4: Compare the positions of nitrogen and carbon.

      Both nitrogen and carbon are in the same period (period 2), but carbon is located
      to the left of nitrogen in the periodic table.


      Step 5: Draw a conclusion based on the periodic table arrangement.

      Since carbon is located to the left of nitrogen in the same period, it has a
      lower atomic number than nitrogen.

      step:


      1. Atomic number: The atomic number of an element is the number of protons in
      its nucleus. Elements are arranged in the periodic table in order of increasing
      atomic number.


      2. Uranium: Uranium is a heavy metal and is often associated with radioactivity.
      It is located in the actinide series of the periodic table.


      3. Lead: Lead is also a heavy metal, but it is not radioactive. It is located
      in the main body of the periodic table, in the carbon group (group 14).


      4. Periodic table order: In the periodic table, elements in the main body come
      before elements in the actinide series. This means that lead, which is in the
      main body, has a lower atomic number than uranium, which is in the actinide
      series.


      Therefore, lead has a lower atomic number than uranium.'

      atomic number between uranium and lead, let''s follow these steps:


      Step 1: Understand what atomic number means.

      The atomic number of an element is the number of protons in its nucleus. It
      is a unique identifier for each element and determines its position in the periodic
      table.


      Step 2: Recall the position of uranium and lead in the periodic table.

      Uranium (U) is located in the actinide series, which is in the bottom row of
      the periodic table. Lead (Pb) is located in the 6th period (row) and the 14th
      group (column) of the main body of the periodic table.


      Step 3: Consider the general trend of atomic numbers in the periodic table.

      In the periodic table, elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number
      from left to right and top to bottom. This means that elements in the upper
      rows generally have lower atomic numbers than those in the lower rows.


      Step 4: Compare the positions of uranium and lead.

      Since lead is located in the 6th period of the main body of the periodic table,
      while uranium is located in the bottom row (the actinide series), we can conclude
      that lead has a lower atomic number than uranium.

      atom of that element. It is a unique identifier for each element and determines
      its position in the periodic table.


      Step 2: Recall the arrangement of elements in the periodic table.

      In the periodic table, elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number
      from left to right and top to bottom. This means that elements with lower atomic
      numbers are located closer to the top left corner of the table.


      Step 3: Locate sodium and oxygen in the periodic table.

      Sodium (Na) is located in the first column (alkali metals) of the third period
      (row) of the periodic table.

      Oxygen (O) is located in the sixteenth column (chalcogens) of the second period
      (row) of the periodic table.


      Step 4: Compare the positions of sodium and oxygen.

      Since oxygen is located in the second period, and sodium is located in the third
      period, oxygen is closer to the top left corner of the periodic table than sodium.


      Final answer: Oxygen has a lower atomic number than sodium.'

      atom of that element. It is a unique identifier for each element.


      Step 2: Recall the position of sodium and oxygen in the periodic table.

      Sodium (Na) is located in period 3, group 1 of the periodic table.

      2. Now, let''s think about where sulfur and phosphorus are located in the periodic
      table. Sulfur (S) and phosphorus (P) are both in the third period (row) of the
      periodic table, but in different groups (columns).


      3. In the periodic table, elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic
