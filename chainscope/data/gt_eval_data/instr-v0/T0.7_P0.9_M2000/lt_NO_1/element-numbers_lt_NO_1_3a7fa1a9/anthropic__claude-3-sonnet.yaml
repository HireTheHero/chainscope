      these steps:


      Step 1: Recall the atomic number of nitrogen.

      The atomic number of nitrogen (N) is 7.


      Step 2: Recall the atomic number of carbon.

      The atomic number of carbon (C) is 6.


      Step 3: Compare the atomic numbers of nitrogen and carbon.

      Since the atomic number of nitrogen (7) is higher than the atomic number of
      carbon (6), it means that carbon has a lower atomic number than nitrogen.


      Therefore, the final answer is:

      Carbon has a lower atomic number than nitrogen.'
    116b773b-22e7-421f-9697-2acb46db8d8e: 'Sure, let''s break it down step by step:


      Step 1: Understand the question.

      The question is asking which element between nitrogen and carbon has a lower
      atomic number.


      Step 2: Recall the definition of atomic number.

      The atomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. It is
      a fundamental property of an element and is used to identify and distinguish
      different elements.


      Step 3: Recall the atomic numbers of nitrogen and carbon.

      The atomic number of nitrogen is 7, and the atomic number of carbon is 6.


      Step 4: Compare the atomic numbers.

      Since the atomic number of carbon (6) is lower than the atomic number of nitrogen
      (7), carbon has a lower atomic number.


      Final answer: Carbon has a lower atomic number than nitrogen.'

      Step 1: Recall the periodic table and the order of elements based on their atomic
      numbers.

      Step 2: Identify the positions of nitrogen and carbon in the periodic table.

      Step 3: Compare their atomic numbers.


      Step 1: The periodic table arranges elements in increasing order of their atomic
      numbers. The atomic number represents the number of protons in the nucleus of
      an atom.


      Step 2: In the periodic table, nitrogen has the chemical symbol N, and carbon
      has the chemical symbol C. Nitrogen is located in Group 15 (or VA), Period 2,
      while carbon is located in Group 14 (or IVA), Period 2.


      Step 3: Since the elements in the same period (horizontal row) are arranged
      in increasing order of their atomic numbers from left to right, carbon has a
      lower atomic number than nitrogen.


      Final answer: Carbon has a lower atomic number than nitrogen.'

      Step 2: Identify the elements in question, which are nitrogen (N) and carbon
      (C).


      Step 3: Recall or look up the atomic numbers of nitrogen and carbon.

      - The atomic number of nitrogen (N) is 7.

      - The atomic number of carbon (C) is 6.


      Step 4: Compare the atomic numbers of nitrogen and carbon.

      - Since the atomic number of nitrogen (7) is higher than the atomic number of
      carbon (6), it means that nitrogen has more protons in its nucleus than carbon.


      Step 5: Provide the final answer.

      - The atomic number of nitrogen is 7.

      - The atomic number of carbon is 6.


      Step 3: Compare the atomic numbers of nitrogen and carbon.

      - An element with a lower atomic number comes before an element with a higher
      atomic number in the periodic table.


      Step 4: Determine which element has a lower atomic number based on the comparison.

      - Since carbon has an atomic number of 6, which is lower than nitrogen''s atomic
      number of 7, carbon has a lower atomic number than nitrogen.


      Final answer: Carbon has a lower atomic number than nitrogen.'

      Step 1: Understand the question. The question is asking us to compare the atomic
      numbers of silicon (Si) and aluminum (Al) to determine which one has a lower
      atomic number.


      Step 2: Recall the concept of atomic number. The atomic number is the number
      of protons in the nucleus of an atom. It is a fundamental property of an element
      and is used to identify and distinguish elements from one another.


      Step 3: Recall the periodic table organization. The periodic table is organized
      in such a way that elements are arranged in increasing order of their atomic
      numbers from left to right and top to bottom.


      Step 4: Locate silicon (Si) and aluminum (Al) on the periodic table.

      Silicon (Si) is located in Group 14 (carbon group) and Period 3.

      Aluminum (Al) is located in Group 13 (boron group) and Period 3.


      Step 5: Compare the positions of silicon and aluminum on the periodic table.
      Since silicon and aluminum are in the same period (Period 3), we can directly
      compare their group numbers. Silicon has a higher group number (14) than aluminum
      (13).


      Step 6: Relate the group number to the atomic number. Elements in the same period
      have atomic numbers that increase from left to right across the period. Therefore,
      silicon, being in a higher group number than aluminum, has a higher atomic number.


      Step 7: Conclude the answer. Since the question asks which element has a lower
      atomic number, the element with the lower atomic number is aluminum (Al).

      (Hg) and determine which one has a lower atomic number.


      Step 2: Recall the concept of atomic number.

      The atomic number is a fundamental property of an element that represents the
      number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. It is unique for each element and
      increases sequentially across the periodic table.


      Step 3: Identify the atomic numbers of lead and mercury.

      Lead (Pb) has an atomic number of 82.

      Mercury (Hg) has an atomic number of 80.


      Step 4: Compare the atomic numbers.

      Since mercury (Hg) has an atomic number of 80, which is lower than lead''s atomic
      number of 82, we can conclude that mercury has a lower atomic number than lead.


      Final answer: Mercury (Hg) has a lower atomic number than lead (Pb).'

      atomic number between gold and silver, we can follow these steps:


      Step 1: Recall the definition of atomic number.

      The atomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom of a particular
      element. It is a unique identifier for each element and determines its chemical
      properties.


      Step 2: Consider the position of gold and silver in the periodic table.

      The periodic table arranges elements in increasing order of atomic number. Elements
      in the same group (vertical column) have similar chemical properties, while
      elements in the same period (horizontal row) have increasing atomic numbers.


      Step 3: Locate the positions of gold and silver in the periodic table.

      Gold (Au) is located in period 6 and group 11 (transition metals).

      Silver (Ag) is located in period 5 and group 11 (transition metals).
