      \ in its nucleus.\n\n3. Sulfur's atomic number is 16.\n   \u2022 This means\
      \ sulfur has 16 protons in its nucleus.\n\n4. Since 16 is less than 17, sulfur\

      1. First, recall the periodic table and the order of elements based on atomic
      number.


      2. Chlorine''s atomic number is 17.


      3. Sulfur''s atomic number is 16.


      4. Since 16 is less than 17, sulfur has the lower atomic number.


      Therefore, the answer is: Sulfur has a lower atomic number than chlorine.'
