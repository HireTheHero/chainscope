      1. First, let''s consider the types of aircraft:

      - Boeing 737-800 is a narrow-body, short to medium-range passenger aircraft

      - Airbus A380 is a wide-body, long-haul, double-deck superjumbo passenger aircraft


      2. Typical cruise speeds:

      - Boeing 737-800 typically cruises at around 470-530 knots (540-610 mph)

      - Airbus A380 typically cruises at around 470-510 knots (540-586 mph)


      3. Comparing the speeds:

      - Their cruise speeds are quite similar

      - The A380 is a larger, heavier aircraft, which might suggest it could be slightly
      slower

      - However, the difference is minimal


      4. Precise comparison:

      - The Boeing 737-800 has a slightly higher maximum cruise speed

      - The A380 is designed more for long-haul efficiency than pure speed


      5. Conclusion:

      The Boeing 737-800 is marginally faster than the Airbus A380.

    afe4d519-3104-4c14-b799-26a36c1c2b25: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s consider the purpose and design of these aircraft:

      - Airbus A380 is a large, long-haul, wide-body aircraft

      - Airbus A320 is a narrow-body, short to medium-range aircraft


      2. Speed characteristics:

      - The A380 is designed for long international routes and typically cruises at
      around 907 km/h (564 mph)

      - The A320 typically cruises at around 871 km/h (541 mph)


      3. Comparing the speeds:

      - The A380''s cruise speed is slightly higher than the A320''s

      - This means the A380 is actually faster, not slower


      4. Reasoning behind the speed difference:

      - The A380 is a larger aircraft with more powerful engines

      - It''s designed for long-distance, high-efficiency travel

      - The A320 is designed for shorter routes with different performance requirements


      5. Final conclusion:

      The Airbus A380 is faster than the Airbus A320.


      Therefore, the answer is: Neither. The A380 is faster than the A320.'
