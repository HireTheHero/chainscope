      1. Let''s recall the typical cruise speeds for each aircraft:

      - Boeing 737-800: Cruise speed around Mach 0.785 (approximately 530 mph)

      - Airbus A380: Cruise speed around Mach 0.85 (approximately 560 mph)


      2. Converting to the same units for comparison:

      - Both speeds are already in comparable units (Mach numbers and mph)

      - 737-800: Mach 0.785 < A380: Mach 0.85

      - 737-800: 530 mph < A380: 560 mph


      3. Analyzing the data:

      - The A380 is designed for long-haul flights where higher cruise speeds are
      beneficial

      - The 737-800 is designed for short to medium-haul flights where maximum speed
      is less critical


      Final answer: The Boeing 737-800 is the slower aircraft of the two.'

      - Concorde''s maximum speed was Mach 2.04 (about 1,354 mph at cruise altitude)

      - F-16''s maximum speed is Mach 2.0 (about 1,500 mph at altitude)


      2. However, I need to be careful here because:

      - Mach numbers are relative to the speed of sound, which varies with altitude

      - The actual speed in mph/kph matters more for direct comparison


      3. Looking at the actual speeds:

      - Concorde cruised at around 1,354 mph (2,179 km/h)

      - F-16 can reach around 1,500 mph (2,414 km/h)


      4. Comparing these numbers:

      1,354 mph < 1,500 mph


      Therefore, the Concorde is slower than the F-16 Fighting Falcon.


      Final answer: Concorde is slower.'

      - 787: Maximum speed is about Mach 0.90


      3. Comparing these numbers:

      - Their typical cruise speeds are identical

      - The 747-400 actually has a slightly higher maximum speed

      - However, in normal operations, both planes fly at the same speed


      4. Considering that the question asks which is slower, and they operate at the
      same cruise speed in practice, this is essentially a tie.


      Final answer: Neither is slower - the Boeing 747-400 and Boeing 787 Dreamliner
      operate at the same typical cruise speed of Mach 0.85. If we consider maximum
      speeds, the 747-400 is actually slightly faster.'

      - Boeing 787 Dreamliner: Mach 0.85 (around 570 mph / 917 km/h)

      - Boeing 787 Dreamliner: Mach 0.90


      4. The maximum speeds are slightly different, with the 747-400 having a slightly
      higher maximum speed.


      Final answer: Neither is slower at typical cruise speeds (they''re the same
      at Mach 0.85). However, if we consider maximum speeds, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner

      2. The difference is very small, but we can compare:

      3. Therefore:

      - The 787 Dreamliner is slightly slower than the 747-400
