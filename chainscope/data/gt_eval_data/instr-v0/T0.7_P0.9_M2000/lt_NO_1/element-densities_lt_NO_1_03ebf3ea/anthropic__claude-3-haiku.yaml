      Step 1: Understand the concept of density.

      Density is a physical property that describes the mass of a substance per unit
      volume. It is calculated as the ratio of the mass of a substance to its volume.


      Step 2: Consider the atomic properties of potassium and lithium.

      Potassium (K) is an alkali metal with an atomic number of 19, and lithium (Li)
      is also an alkali metal with an atomic number of 3.


      Step 3: Compare the atomic masses of potassium and lithium.

      The atomic mass of potassium is 39.098 g/mol, while the atomic mass of lithium
      is 6.941 g/mol.

      Since lithium has a lower atomic mass (6.941 g/mol) compared to potassium (39.098

      - Potassium (K) is a soft, silvery-white metal that is the 19th element on the

    f2585424-9169-4b22-8b2a-6ddecb619d64: 'To determine which substance, sodium or
      potassium, is less dense, we need to go through the following steps:


      Step 1: Understand the properties of sodium and potassium.

      - Sodium (Na) is an alkali metal, and potassium (K) is also an alkali metal.

      - Alkali metals are known for their low densities compared to other elements.


      Step 2: Compare the atomic masses of sodium and potassium.

      - Sodium has an atomic mass of 22.99 g/mol.

      - Potassium has an atomic mass of 39.10 g/mol.


      Step 3: Analyze the relationship between atomic mass and density.

      - Generally, the lower the atomic mass of an element, the lower its density.

      - This is because the same number of atoms (Avogadro''s number) occupies a larger
      volume for elements with lower atomic masses.


      Step 4: Apply the reasoning to sodium and potassium.

      - Since sodium has a lower atomic mass (22.99 g/mol) compared to potassium (39.10
      g/mol), sodium should have a lower density.


      Therefore, the substance that is less dense between sodium and potassium is
      sodium.'

      between sodium (Na) and potassium (K), we can follow these steps:


      Step 1: Understand the concept of density.

      Density is the mass per unit volume of a substance. Substances with the same
      mass but a larger volume will have a lower density.


      Step 2: Consider the atomic properties of sodium and potassium.

      Sodium and potassium are both alkali metals, which are group 1 elements in the
      periodic table. Alkali metals have large atomic radii and low ionization energies,
      meaning they easily lose their valence electrons to form positive ions.


      Step 3: Compare the atomic masses and atomic radii of sodium and potassium.

      Sodium has an atomic mass of 22.99 g/mol and an atomic radius of 186 pm (picometers).

      Potassium has an atomic mass of 39.10 g/mol and an atomic radius of 227 pm.


      Step 4: Analyze the relationship between atomic mass and volume.

      Since potassium has a larger atomic radius than sodium, it has a larger atomic
      volume. However, potassium also has a higher atomic mass than sodium.


      Step 5: Determine which substance is less dense.

      The density of a substance is directly proportional to its atomic mass and inversely
      proportional to its atomic volume (or radius). Since potassium has a larger
      atomic radius and a higher atomic mass compared to sodium, it will have a lower
      density.


      Therefore, the substance that is less dense is potassium.'
