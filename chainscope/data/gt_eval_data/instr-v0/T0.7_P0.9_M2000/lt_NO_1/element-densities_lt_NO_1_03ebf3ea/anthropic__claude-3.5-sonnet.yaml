      1) First, I''ll recall what factors affect density:

      - Atomic mass

      - Atomic radius/volume

      - Crystal structure


      2) Let me check the relevant properties:

      - Magnesium (Mg): atomic number 12, atomic mass 24.3

      - Sodium (Na): atomic number 11, atomic mass 23.0


      3) Both are metals in the same period of the periodic table:

      - Mg is in Group 2

      - Na is in Group 1


      4) Consider atomic radius:

      - Going left to right in a period, atomic radius decreases

      - Since Na is to the left of Mg, Na has a larger atomic radius


      5) Reasoning:

      - Na has slightly lower mass (23.0 vs 24.3)

      - Na has larger atomic radius (takes up more space)

      - Density = mass/volume

      - Lower mass and larger volume means lower density


      Therefore, sodium is less dense than magnesium.


      Final answer: Sodium is less dense.'
