      1. First, let me recall when each structure was completed:


      2. The Panama Canal:

      - Construction began in 1904 (by the United States, after taking over from failed
      French attempt)

      - It was completed in 1914


      3. The Empire State Building:

      - Construction began in 1930

      - It was completed in 1931


      4. Comparing the completion dates:

      - Panama Canal: 1914

      - Empire State Building: 1931

      - The difference is about 17 years


      Therefore, the Panama Canal was completed earlier than the Empire State Building.


      Final answer: The Panama Canal was completed earlier.'
