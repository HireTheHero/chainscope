      Simplon Tunnel or the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel, let''s follow these steps:


      Step 1: Identify the location of the tunnels.

      - The Simplon Tunnel is a railway tunnel that connects Switzerland and Italy
      through the Alps.

      - The St. Gotthard Road Tunnel is a road tunnel in Switzerland that connects
      the northern and southern parts of the country, also through the Alps.


      Step 2: Research the lengths of the tunnels.

      - The Simplon Tunnel is approximately 19.8 km (12.3 miles) long.

      - The St. Gotthard Road Tunnel is approximately 16.9 km (10.5 miles) long.


      Step 3: Compare the lengths of the tunnels.

      Holland Tunnel or the Lincoln Tunnel, let''s think through this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the location of the tunnels.

      Both the Holland Tunnel and the Lincoln Tunnel are located in the New York City
      area, connecting Manhattan to New Jersey underneath the Hudson River.


      Step 2: Consider the purpose of the tunnels.

      The Holland Tunnel and the Lincoln Tunnel were both constructed to provide vehicular
      access between Manhattan and New Jersey.


      Step 3: Research the lengths of the tunnels.

      After a quick search, I found the following information:

      - The Holland Tunnel is approximately 1.6 miles (2.6 km) long.

      - The Lincoln Tunnel is approximately 1.5 miles (2.4 km) long.


      Step 4: Compare the lengths of the tunnels.

      Based on the information found, the Lincoln Tunnel is slightly shorter than
      the Holland Tunnel by about 0.1 miles (0.2 km).


      Final Answer: The Lincoln Tunnel is shorter than the Holland Tunnel.'

      Step 1: Understand the location of the tunnels.

      - Both tunnels are located in the New York City area, connecting Manhattan to
      New Jersey.

      - The Holland Tunnel connects Lower Manhattan to Jersey City, New Jersey.

      - The Lincoln Tunnel connects Midtown Manhattan to Weehawken, New Jersey.


      Step 2: Consider the geography of the area.

      - Manhattan is an island, and the tunnels must cross the Hudson River to reach
      New Jersey.

      - The width of the Hudson River varies along the length of Manhattan.


      Step 3: Analyze the location of the tunnels in relation to the width of the
      Hudson River.

      - The Holland Tunnel is located in Lower Manhattan, where the Hudson River is
      relatively wide.

      - The Lincoln Tunnel is located in Midtown Manhattan, where the Hudson River
      is narrower compared to Lower Manhattan.


      Step 4: Conclude which tunnel is likely to be shorter based on the width of
      the river at their respective locations.

      - Since the Lincoln Tunnel crosses the Hudson River at a narrower point than
      the Holland Tunnel, it is likely that the Lincoln Tunnel is shorter in length.


      Final answer: Based on the reasoning above, the Lincoln Tunnel is likely to
      be shorter than the Holland Tunnel.'

      the Holland Tunnel and the Lincoln Tunnel, we need to gather some information
      and reason step by step. Let''s begin:


      Step 1: Understand the location and purpose of each tunnel.

      - The Holland Tunnel connects Manhattan, New York, to Jersey City, New Jersey,
      passing under the Hudson River.

      - The Lincoln Tunnel also connects Manhattan, New York, to Weehawken, New Jersey,
      passing under the Hudson River.


      Step 2: Research the lengths of each tunnel.

      - The Holland Tunnel is approximately 1.6 miles (2.6 km) long.

      - The Lincoln Tunnel is approximately 1.5 miles (2.4 km) long.


      Step 3: Compare the lengths of the tunnels.

      - The Holland Tunnel is 1.6 miles long, while the Lincoln Tunnel is 1.5 miles
      long.

      - 1.5 miles is shorter than 1.6 miles.


      Final answer: The Lincoln Tunnel, at approximately 1.5 miles (2.4 km) long,

      1. The Holland Tunnel and the Lincoln Tunnel are both tunnels that connect New
      Jersey to New York City under the Hudson River.


      2. The Holland Tunnel connects Jersey City, New Jersey, to the lower west side
      of Manhattan, while the Lincoln Tunnel connects Weehawken, New Jersey, to Midtown
      Manhattan.


      3. The route between New Jersey and Lower Manhattan (Holland Tunnel) is shorter
      than the route between New Jersey and Midtown Manhattan (Lincoln Tunnel).


      4. Since the Holland Tunnel connects New Jersey to a point in Manhattan that
      is further south than the Lincoln Tunnel''s connection point, it would be reasonable
      to assume that the Holland Tunnel is shorter in length.


      5. Additionally, the Holland Tunnel was constructed earlier (opened in 1927)
      than the Lincoln Tunnel (opened in 1937). At the time of the Holland Tunnel''s
      construction, engineers likely chose the shortest possible route.

      1. The Lincoln Tunnel connects New York City and New Jersey under the Hudson
      River. It''s an important route for vehicles traveling between Manhattan and
      New Jersey.


      2. The Sydney Harbour Tunnel is a tunnel in Sydney, Australia that goes under
      Sydney Harbour. It connects the central business district of Sydney with the
      northern suburbs.


      3. New York City and New Jersey are part of the United States, while Sydney
      is a city in Australia. The United States and Australia are on different continents
      with the US in North America and Australia being its own continent in the southern
      hemisphere.


      4. Generally, tunnels within cities tend to be shorter than tunnels that connect

      Step 3: Comparison

      - The Seikan Tunnel has a total length of 53.85 km (33.46 miles).

      - The entire Chunnel, including the service tunnel, has a total length of 50.45

      1. The Queens-Midtown Tunnel is a vehicular tunnel in New York City. It connects
      the boroughs of Queens and Manhattan, passing under the East River. As it''s
      a major urban tunnel, it''s likely to be relatively long.


      2. The Zion-Mount Carmel Tunnel is a vehicular tunnel in Zion National Park,
      Utah. It was built to provide access to Bryce Canyon and Grand Canyon from Zion.
      As it''s in a national park, it might be shorter than a major urban tunnel.


      3. However, the Zion-Mount Carmel Tunnel was a significant engineering feat
      when it was built in the 1920s. It had to pass through solid rock and was the
      longest tunnel of its type in the United States at the time. This suggests it''s
      also a substantial tunnel.


      4. Without knowing the exact lengths, it''s hard to say for certain which is
      shorter. Urban tunnels can be very long, but so can tunnels through mountains.
      It likely depends on the specific geography and engineering challenges of each
      tunnel.
