      Step 2: Gather relevant information about the two tunnels.

      The Holland Tunnel is a vehicular tunnel that connects Manhattan, New York City,

      The Lincoln Tunnel is also a vehicular tunnel that connects Manhattan, New York
      City, to Weehawken, New Jersey, passing under the Hudson River.


      Step 3: Compare the lengths of the two tunnels.

      According to available information:

      - The Holland Tunnel has a total length of approximately 1.6 miles (2.6 km).

      - The Lincoln Tunnel has a total length of approximately 1.5 miles (2.4 km).

      Step 1: Identify the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line

      - The Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line is a bridge-tunnel crossing Tokyo Bay in Japan.

      - It has a total length of 14.7 kilometers (9.1 miles).

      - The tunnel portion is 9.6 kilometers (6.0 miles) long.


      Step 2: Identify the Eisenhower Tunnel

      - The Eisenhower Tunnel is a dual-bore tunnel located on Interstate 70 in Colorado,
      United States.

      - Each of the two tunnels is 8.7 kilometers (5.4 miles) long.

      - Together, the total length of the Eisenhower Tunnel is 17.4 kilometers (10.8
      miles).


      Step 3: Compare the lengths

      - The tunnel portion of the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line is 9.6 kilometers (6.0 miles)
      long.

      - Each bore of the Eisenhower Tunnel is 8.7 kilometers (5.4 miles) long.


      Step 4: Determine the shorter tunnel

      - The tunnel portion of the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line (9.6 kilometers or 6.0 miles)
      is longer than a single bore of the Eisenhower Tunnel (8.7 kilometers or 5.4
      miles).

      - Therefore, a single bore of the Eisenhower Tunnel is shorter than the tunnel
      portion of the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line.


      Final Answer: The Eisenhower Tunnel (a single bore) is shorter than the tunnel
      portion of the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line.'
