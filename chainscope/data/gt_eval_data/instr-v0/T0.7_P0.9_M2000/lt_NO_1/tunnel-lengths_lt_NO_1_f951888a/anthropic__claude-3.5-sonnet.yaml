      1. First, let me recall the facts about both tunnels:

      - Holland Tunnel connects Lower Manhattan (NYC) to Jersey City, NJ

      - Lincoln Tunnel connects Midtown Manhattan (NYC) to Weehawken, NJ


      2. Let me find their lengths:

      - Holland Tunnel is 8,558 feet (2.608 km) long

      - Lincoln Tunnel is 7,482 feet (2.281 km) long


      3. Now I can compare:

      - 7,482 feet < 8,558 feet


      Therefore, the Lincoln Tunnel is shorter than the Holland Tunnel.


      Final answer: The Lincoln Tunnel is shorter.'

      - Zion-Mount Carmel: 5,613 feet


      3. Comparing these numbers:

      1. First, I need to recall the lengths of both tunnels:

      - St. Gotthard Road Tunnel (Switzerland/Italy) is 16.9 km (10.5 miles) long

      - Mont Blanc Tunnel (France/Italy) is 11.6 km (7.2 miles) long


      2. Now I can compare these numbers:

      16.9 km > 11.6 km


      3. Since 11.6 km is less than 16.9 km, the Mont Blanc Tunnel is shorter.


      Final answer: The Mont Blanc Tunnel is shorter than the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel.'

      - Eisenhower Tunnel (Colorado) is approximately 1.7 miles long

      - Holland Tunnel (New York/New Jersey) is approximately 1.6 miles long


      2. To compare them, I''ll convert both to the same unit:

      - Eisenhower Tunnel = 1.7 miles

      - Holland Tunnel = 1.6 miles


      3. Now I can directly compare:

      1.7 > 1.6


      Therefore, the Holland Tunnel (1.6 miles) is shorter than the Eisenhower Tunnel
      (1.7 miles).


      Final answer: Holland Tunnel is shorter.'

      1. First, let me recall the details about each tunnel:

      - The Eisenhower Tunnel is in Colorado, cutting through the Continental Divide

      - The Holland Tunnel connects Manhattan, NY to Jersey City, NJ under the Hudson
      River


      2. Let me find their lengths:

      - Eisenhower Tunnel is approximately 1.7 miles (8,978 feet) long

      - Holland Tunnel is approximately 1.6 miles (8,558 feet) long


      3. Now I can compare:

      - 1.7 miles > 1.6 miles

      - 8,978 feet > 8,558 feet


      Therefore, the Holland Tunnel is shorter than the Eisenhower Tunnel.


      Final answer: The Holland Tunnel is shorter.'
