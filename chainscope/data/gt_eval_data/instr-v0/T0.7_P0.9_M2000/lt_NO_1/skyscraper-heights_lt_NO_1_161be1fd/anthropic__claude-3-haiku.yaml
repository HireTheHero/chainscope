      building in the world from 2004 to 2010.

      - Shanghai World Financial Center: This skyscraper is located in Shanghai, China
      and was the tallest building in China from 2008 to 2015.


      Step 2: Compare the heights of the two skyscrapers.

      - Shanghai World Financial Center has a height of 1,614 feet (492 meters).


      Step 3: Analyze the information and determine which one is shorter.

      Since Shanghai World Financial Center has a height of 1,614 feet, and Taipei
      101 has a height of 1,671 feet, the Shanghai World Financial Center is the shorter
      of the two skyscrapers.
