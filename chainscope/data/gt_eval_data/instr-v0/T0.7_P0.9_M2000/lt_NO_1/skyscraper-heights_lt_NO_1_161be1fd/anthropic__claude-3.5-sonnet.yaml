      1. Let me recall the heights of both buildings:

      - The Chrysler Building in New York City is 319 meters (1,046 feet) tall

      - The Shard in London is 310 meters (1,017 feet) tall


      2. Now I can directly compare these numbers:

      - 319 meters > 310 meters


      Therefore, The Shard is shorter than the Chrysler Building.
