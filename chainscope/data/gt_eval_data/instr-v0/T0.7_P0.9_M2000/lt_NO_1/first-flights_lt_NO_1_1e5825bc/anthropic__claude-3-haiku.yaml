      1. The P-51 Mustang and the Spitfire were both iconic fighter aircraft used
      during World War II.


      2. To determine which one made its first flight earlier, we need to look at
      the development timeline of each aircraft.


      3. The Spitfire was developed and designed by R.J. Mitchell at Supermarine Aviation
      Works in the United Kingdom. Its first flight took place on March 5, 1936.


      4. The P-51 Mustang was developed by North American Aviation in the United States.

    4e53478e-2292-48f7-8de6-84cc4a1bc4ae: 'Okay, let''s think through this step-by-step:


      1. The Spitfire is a British fighter aircraft developed in the 1930s by Supermarine.

      2. The DC-3 is an American transport aircraft developed in the 1930s by Douglas
      Aircraft Company.

      3. To determine which made its first flight earlier, we need to look at the
      respective first flight dates of each aircraft.


      Step 1: When did the Spitfire make its first flight?

      The Spitfire''s first flight was on March 5, 1936.


      Step 2: When did the DC-3 make its first flight?

      The DC-3''s first flight was on December 17, 1935.


      Step 3: Compare the first flight dates.

      The DC-3 made its first flight on December 17, 1935, while the Spitfire made
      its first flight on March 5, 1936.


      Therefore, the answer is:

      The DC-3 made its first flight earlier than the Spitfire.'

      flight earlier, the Spitfire or the DC-3, we need to go through the following
      steps:


      Step 1: Identify the first flight dates of the Spitfire and the DC-3.

      - The Spitfire made its first flight on March 5, 1936.

      - The DC-3 made its first flight on December 17, 1935.
