    f0123213-58ff-4116-878d-de7277b8779d: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s identify the Spitfire:

      - The Spitfire was a British fighter aircraft

      - It was designed by R.J. Mitchell

      - It was a key aircraft in the Battle of Britain during World War II


      2. Now, let''s identify the DC-3:

      - The DC-3 was an American transport aircraft

      - It was developed by Douglas Aircraft Company

      - It revolutionized air travel and was widely used in commercial and military
      aviation


      3. Let''s find the first flight dates:

      - Spitfire: First flight was on 5 March 1936

      - DC-3: First flight was on 17 December 1935


      4. Comparing the dates:

      - The DC-3 made its first flight on 17 December 1935

      - The Spitfire made its first flight on 5 March 1936

      - This means the DC-3 flew first, by about 3-4 months


      Therefore, the DC-3 made its first flight earlier than the Spitfire.'
