      - The first production F-16A flew in December 1976


      3. For the Airbus A320:

      - The A320''s first flight was on February 22, 1987

      - This was about 13 years after the F-16''s first flight


      4. Comparing the dates:

      - F-16: January 20, 1974

      - A320: February 22, 1987

      - 1974 comes before 1987


      Therefore, the F-16 Fighting Falcon made its first flight earlier than the Airbus
      A320, by about 13 years.


      Final answer: F-16 Fighting Falcon'

      - The B-52''s first flight was on April 15, 1952

      - It was developed in the late 1940s and early 1950s


      4. Comparing the dates:

      - B-52: April 15, 1952

      - SR-71: December 22, 1964

      - The difference is about 12 years
