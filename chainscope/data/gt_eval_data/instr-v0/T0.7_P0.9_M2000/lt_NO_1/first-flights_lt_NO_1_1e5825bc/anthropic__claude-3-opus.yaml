      flight earlier, the DC-3 or the Spirit of St. Louis, let''s think through this
      step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the aircraft and their significance.

      - The DC-3 was a propeller-driven airliner that revolutionized air transport
      in the 1930s and 1940s.

      - The Spirit of St. Louis was the custom-built, single-engine monoplane that
      Charles Lindbergh flew on the first solo nonstop transatlantic flight in 1927.


      Step 2: Consider the historical context.

      - Charles Lindbergh''s solo transatlantic flight in 1927 was a groundbreaking
      achievement in aviation history.

      - The DC-3 was developed in the 1930s as a response to the growing demand for
      passenger air travel.


      Step 3: Determine which event occurred first.

      - Charles Lindbergh''s flight in the Spirit of St. Louis took place in 1927.

      - The DC-3 was developed and first flew in the 1930s, specifically in 1935.


      Final answer: The Spirit of St. Louis made its first flight earlier than the
      DC-3. Charles Lindbergh''s historic transatlantic flight in the Spirit of St.

      flight earlier, let''s consider the information we have about each aircraft
      and their respective first flights.


      Step 1: The Wright Flyer

      - The Wright Flyer was the first powered, heavier-than-air machine to achieve
      controlled, sustained flight with a pilot aboard.

      - It was designed and built by the Wright brothers, Orville and Wilbur Wright.

      - The Wright Flyer''s first flight took place on December 17, 1903, near Kitty
      Hawk, North Carolina.


      Step 2: The Spirit of St. Louis

      - The Spirit of St. Louis was a custom-built, single-engine, single-seat monoplane.

      - It was designed by Donald A. Hall and flown by Charles Lindbergh.

      - The aircraft was named after Lindbergh''s supporters in St. Louis, Missouri.

      - Lindbergh flew the Spirit of St. Louis on the first solo non-stop transatlantic
      flight from New York to Paris on May 20-21, 1927.


      Step 3: Comparing the first flight dates

      - The Wright Flyer''s first flight was on December 17, 1903.

      - The Spirit of St. Louis''s first flight was on May 20-21, 1927.

      - Clearly, the Wright Flyer''s first flight predates the Spirit of St. Louis''s
      first flight by more than 23 years.


      Final Answer: The Wright Flyer made its first flight earlier than the Spirit
      of St. Louis.'
