      Step 1: Understand the properties of iron and copper.

      - Iron (Fe) is a transition metal, and its atomic number is 26.

      - Copper (Cu) is also a transition metal, and its atomic number is 29.


      Step 2: Analyze the periodic table trends.

      - As we move down a group in the periodic table, the atomic radius of elements
      generally increases.

      - As the atomic radius increases, the intermolecular forces (van der Waals forces)
      between the atoms also increase.


      Step 3: Apply the periodic table trends to iron and copper.

      - Since copper has a higher atomic number (29) compared to iron (26), it has
      a larger atomic radius.

      - Consequently, the intermolecular forces between copper atoms are stronger
      than those between iron atoms.


      Step 4: Relate the intermolecular forces to boiling point.

      - Stronger intermolecular forces require more energy to overcome, leading to
      a higher boiling point.

      has a lower boiling point, we need to follow a step-by-step reasoning process:


      Step 1: Understand the relationship between boiling point and intermolecular
      forces.

      The boiling point of a substance is directly related to the strength of the
      intermolecular forces between its particles (atoms or molecules). Generally,
      substances with stronger intermolecular forces have higher boiling points, while
      substances with weaker intermolecular forces have lower boiling points.


      Step 2: Identify the type of intermolecular forces present in iron and copper.

      Iron and copper are both metals, and the intermolecular forces in metals are
      primarily metallic bonds. Metallic bonds are the result of the delocalized electrons
      in the metal, which are shared among the metal atoms.


      Step 3: Compare the strength of metallic bonds in iron and copper.

      The strength of metallic bonds is influenced by factors such as the atomic radius
      and the number of valence electrons. Copper has a smaller atomic radius and
      a higher number of valence electrons compared to iron. This means that the metallic
      bonds in copper are generally stronger than the metallic bonds in iron.


      Step 4: Draw the conclusion.

      Since copper has stronger metallic bonds compared to iron, it will have a higher

      equals the pressure surrounding the liquid, and bubbles of vapor form inside
      the liquid.


      2. The boiling point of a substance depends on the strength of the intermolecular

      boiling point between aluminum and silver, we need to consider the following
      steps:


      Step 1: Understand the properties of aluminum and silver.

      - Aluminum (Al) is a metal with an atomic number of 13.

      - Silver (Ag) is a metal with an atomic number of 47.


      Step 2: Examine the periodic table trends.

      - As we move down a group in the periodic table, the atomic radius of the elements
      generally increases.

      - As the atomic radius increases, the intermolecular forces (such as van der
      Waals forces) between the atoms become weaker.


      Step 3: Apply the periodic table trend to aluminum and silver.

      - Since silver has a higher atomic number (47) compared to aluminum (13), silver
      has a larger atomic radius.

      - Therefore, the intermolecular forces between silver atoms are weaker than
      the intermolecular forces between aluminum atoms.


      Step 4: Relate the intermolecular forces to the boiling point.

      - Weaker intermolecular forces require less energy to overcome, resulting in
      a lower boiling point.

      aluminum (Al).'

      The boiling point of a substance is primarily determined by the strength of
      the intermolecular forces between the molecules. Stronger intermolecular forces

      2. Hydrogen bonding

      3. Van der Waals forces


      Let''s compare the intermolecular forces in methanol and acetone:


      Methanol (CH3OH):

      - Methanol has a polar O-H bond, which can participate in hydrogen bonding.

      - The hydrogen bonding between methanol molecules is a relatively strong intermolecular
      force.


      Acetone (CH3COCH3):

      - Acetone has a polar C=O bond, which can participate in dipole-dipole interactions.

      - However, acetone does not have the ability to form hydrogen bonds like methanol.

      - Oxygen (O2) is also a gas at room temperature and standard pressure.


      Step 2: Examine the intermolecular forces between the molecules.

      - Carbon dioxide (CO2) has a linear molecular structure with a slightly polar
      nature due to the unequal sharing of electrons between the carbon and oxygen
      atoms.

      - Oxygen (O2) has a non-polar, diatomic molecular structure.


      Step 3: Relate the intermolecular forces to the boiling point.

      - Substances with stronger intermolecular forces generally have higher boiling
      points, as more energy is required to overcome these forces and convert the
      liquid to a gas.

      - The slightly polar nature of carbon dioxide (CO2) leads to slightly stronger
      intermolecular forces (van der Waals forces) compared to the non-polar oxygen
      (O2) molecules.


      Step 4: Determine the final answer.

      Based on the steps above, oxygen (O2) has weaker intermolecular forces compared
      to carbon dioxide (CO2). Therefore, oxygen (O2) has a lower boiling point than
      carbon dioxide (CO2).


      Final answer: Oxygen (O2) has a lower boiling point than carbon dioxide (CO2).'

      Step 1: Consider the periodic table trends.

      When we look at the periodic table, we observe that as we move down a group
      (vertical column), the atomic radius of the elements increases. This is because
      the number of electron shells increases, and the distance between the nucleus

      Step 2: Understand the relationship between atomic radius and boiling point.

      The boiling point of a substance is related to the strength of the intermolecular
      forces between its particles. Larger atoms have a greater polarizability, which
      leads to stronger intermolecular forces, such as van der Waals forces. Stronger
      intermolecular forces result in higher boiling points.


      Step 3: Compare the atomic radii of silver and lead.

      The strength of metallic bonds is influenced by factors such as the size of

      Based on the information above, we can conclude that the metallic bonds in silver

      forces have lower boiling points.


      Step 2: Consider the type of intermolecular forces present in silver and lead.

      Silver and lead are both metallic elements, so the primary intermolecular forces
      present in these substances are metallic bonds.


      Step 3: Analyze the metallic bond strength in silver and lead.

      The strength of metallic bonds is related to the atomic properties of the elements,
      such as atomic radius and electronegativity. Generally, elements with smaller
      atomic radii and higher electronegativities form stronger metallic bonds.


      Step 4: Compare the atomic properties of silver and lead.

      Silver (Ag) has an atomic radius of 144 pm, while lead (Pb) has a larger atomic
      radius of 175 pm. Additionally, silver has a higher electronegativity (1.93)
      compared to lead (1.87).


      Step 5: Draw the conclusion.

      Based on the comparison of the atomic properties, silver has stronger metallic
      bonds than lead. This means that silver has higher intermolecular forces and,
      consequently, a higher boiling point compared to lead.
