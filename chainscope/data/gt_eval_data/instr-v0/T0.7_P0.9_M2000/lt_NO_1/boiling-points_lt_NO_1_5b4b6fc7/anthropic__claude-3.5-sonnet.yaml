      \ between molecules.\n\n3) The main intermolecular forces in alcohols are:\n\
      \   - Hydrogen bonding\n   - Van der Waals forces\n\n4) Both molecules have\
      \ similar hydrogen bonding capabilities (one -OH group each).\n\n5) However,\
      \ ethanol has an extra CH2 group compared to methanol, which means:\n   - It\
      \ has a larger molecular mass\n   - It has more surface area for Van der Waals\
      \ interactions\n\n6) The additional Van der Waals forces in ethanol mean that\
      \ more energy is needed to separate its molecules.\n\nTherefore: Methanol has\
      \ a lower boiling point than ethanol.\n\n(For reference, methanol boils at 64.7\xB0\
      C, while ethanol boils at 78.37\xB0C)"
