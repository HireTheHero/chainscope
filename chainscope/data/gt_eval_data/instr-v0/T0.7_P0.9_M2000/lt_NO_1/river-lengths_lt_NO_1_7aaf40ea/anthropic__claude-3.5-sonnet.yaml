      1) First, let me recall the lengths of both rivers:

      - The Yangtze River is approximately 6,300 kilometers (3,915 miles) long

      - The Mississippi River is approximately 3,766 kilometers (2,340 miles) long


      2) To compare them, I''ll use the same unit (kilometers):

      - Yangtze: 6,300 km

      - Mississippi: 3,766 km


      3) Comparing these numbers:

      6,300 > 3,766


      Therefore, the Mississippi River is shorter than the Yangtze River.


      Final answer: The Mississippi River is shorter.'

      2. Converting both to the same unit (kilometers):

      - Yangtze: 6,300 km

      - Mississippi: 3,766 km


      3. Comparing the numbers:

      - 6,300 > 3,766

      - Therefore, the Mississippi River is shorter by about 2,534 kilometers

      3. Now I can subtract to find the difference:

      6,300 - 3,766 = 2,534 km

      The Yangtze is 2,534 km longer than the Mississippi


      Therefore, the Mississippi River is shorter than the Yangtze River.
