    80341755-5230-4795-8b80-7b6af9576f51: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. VHS Player:

      - VHS (Video Home System) was developed by JVC

      - First introduced to the consumer market in 1976

      - Became widely available in the late 1970s


      2. Xerox Alto:

      - Developed at Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center)

      - Prototype was first created in 1973

      - Considered a pioneering personal computer

      - Not a commercial product, but a research computer

      - Influential in the development of graphical user interfaces


      3. Comparing the dates:

      - Xerox Alto: 1973

      - VHS Player: 1976


      4. Chronological order:

      - The Xerox Alto was developed and created BEFORE the VHS Player was introduced
      to the market


      Therefore, the Xerox Alto was released earlier.


      Final answer: Xerox Alto'

      - Sony Walkman: July 1979

      - The TRS-80 was released approximately 2 years earlier than the Sony Walkman


      Therefore, the TRS-80 was released earlier.


      Answer: TRS-80'

      1. Sony Walkman:

      - Introduced by Sony in Japan

      - First model (TPS-L2) was released on July 1, 1979

      - Became commercially available later that year


      2. TRS-80:

      - Developed by Tandy Corporation/Radio Shack

      - First model was released in August 1977

      - Was one of the first mass-produced personal computers


      3. Comparing release dates:

      - TRS-80: August 1977

      - Sony Walkman: July 1979


      4. Chronological order:

      - The TRS-80 was released approximately 2 years before the Sony Walkman


      Therefore, the TRS-80 was released earlier.
