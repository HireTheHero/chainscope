      - PlayStation: December 1994 (first release in Japan)

      - Windows 95: August 1995

      - Even though the PlayStation came to many markets after Windows 95, its initial
      release was earlier


      Therefore, the Sony PlayStation was released earlier than Windows 95, with about
      an 8-month difference between their initial releases.


      Answer: Sony PlayStation was released earlier.'
