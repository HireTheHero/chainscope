      - Xerox Alto: An early personal computer developed by Xerox PARC in the 1970s,
      considered a pioneering work in the development of the graphical user interface
      (GUI) and the mouse.

      - Polaroid SX-70: A revolutionary instant film camera introduced by Polaroid
      in 1972, known for its unique folding design and ability to produce self-developing
      photographs.


      Step 2: Investigate the release dates of the two technologies.

      - Xerox Alto was first demonstrated in 1973, but its development began in the
      early 1970s.

      - Polaroid SX-70 was introduced to the public in 1972.


      Step 3: Compare the release dates.

      - The Polaroid SX-70 camera was introduced in 1972, while the Xerox Alto was
