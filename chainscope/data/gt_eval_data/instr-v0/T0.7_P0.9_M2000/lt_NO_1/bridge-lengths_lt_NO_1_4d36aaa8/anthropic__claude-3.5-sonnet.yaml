      - Seven Mile Bridge (Florida Keys) is about 7 miles long (as its name suggests),

      - Mackinac Bridge (Michigan) is about 5 miles long (specifically 26,372 feet),

      2. Now I can directly compare these lengths:

      - 4,760 feet > 3,770 feet

      - 1,451 meters > 1,149 meters


      3. The comparison shows that the George Washington Bridge is longer, which means
      the Sydney Harbour Bridge is shorter.


      Final answer: The Sydney Harbour Bridge is shorter.'

      \ let me recall the lengths of both bridges:\n- \xD8resund Bridge is approximately\
      \ 7.8 km (4.8 miles) long\n- San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge is approximately\
      \ 7.2 km (4.5 miles) long\n\n2. To compare them directly:\n- 7.8 km > 7.2 km\n\
      - 4.8 miles > 4.5 miles\n\n3. Therefore, \xD8resund Bridge is actually longer,\
      \ not shorter.\n\nFinal answer: The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge is shorter\
      \ than the \xD8resund Bridge."
