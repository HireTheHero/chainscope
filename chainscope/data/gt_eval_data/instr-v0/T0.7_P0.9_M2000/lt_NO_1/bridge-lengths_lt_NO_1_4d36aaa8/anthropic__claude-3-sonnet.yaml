      by step:


      Step 1: Identify the bridges in question.

      The two bridges mentioned are the Brooklyn Bridge and the George Washington
      Bridge.


      Step 2: Recall the locations of these bridges.

      The Brooklyn Bridge is located in New York City, spanning the East River and
      connecting the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn.

      The George Washington Bridge is also located in New York City, spanning the

      The question is asking which of the two bridges, the Brooklyn Bridge or the
      George Washington Bridge, is shorter in length.


      Step 2: Recall any relevant information about the two bridges.

      The Brooklyn Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the East River, connecting

      Step 4: Make a logical inference or comparison based on the available information.

      Since we don''t have the exact lengths, we can make a reasonable inference based
      on the following:

      - Both bridges are suspension bridges, which typically have longer spans than
      other bridge types.

      - The George Washington Bridge spans a wider body of water (the Hudson River)
      compared to the Brooklyn Bridge (the East River).

      - Generally, bridges spanning wider bodies of water tend to be longer in length.


      Step 5: Provide the final answer based on the reasoning.

      Based on the available information and the logical inference made, the George
      Washington Bridge is likely the longer of the two bridges when compared to the

      steps:


      Step 1: Understand the question and identify the key information.

      The question is asking which of the two bridges, the Manhattan Bridge or the
      Brooklyn Bridge, is shorter in length.


      Step 2: Gather relevant facts about the two bridges.

      The Manhattan Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the East River, connecting
      Manhattan and Brooklyn in New York City. It was opened to traffic in 1909.


      The Brooklyn Bridge is also a suspension bridge that spans the East River, connecting
      Manhattan and Brooklyn. It was opened to traffic in 1883, making it older than
      the Manhattan Bridge.


      Step 3: Compare the lengths of the two bridges.

      According to various sources, the total length of the Manhattan Bridge is approximately
      2,089 meters (6,855 feet), while the total length of the Brooklyn Bridge is
      approximately 1,834 meters (6,016 feet).


      Step 4: Determine the shorter bridge based on the length comparison.

      Since the Brooklyn Bridge has a total length of 1,834 meters, which is shorter
      than the Manhattan Bridge''s total length of 2,089 meters, the Brooklyn Bridge
      is the shorter of the two bridges.

      Brooklyn Bridge to determine which one is shorter.


      Step 2: Gather relevant facts about the two bridges.

      The Manhattan Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the East River, connecting
      Manhattan and Brooklyn.

      The Brooklyn Bridge is also a suspension bridge that spans the East River, connecting
      Manhattan and Brooklyn.


      Step 3: Research the lengths of the two bridges.

      According to reliable sources:

      - The Manhattan Bridge has a total length of 2,089 meters (1.3 miles or 6,855
      feet).

      - The Brooklyn Bridge has a total length of 1,834 meters (1.14 miles or 6,016
      feet).


      Step 4: Compare the lengths and determine the shorter bridge.

      By comparing the total lengths, it is clear that the Brooklyn Bridge, at 1,834
      meters (6,016 feet), is shorter than the Manhattan Bridge, which is 2,089 meters
      (6,855 feet) long.
