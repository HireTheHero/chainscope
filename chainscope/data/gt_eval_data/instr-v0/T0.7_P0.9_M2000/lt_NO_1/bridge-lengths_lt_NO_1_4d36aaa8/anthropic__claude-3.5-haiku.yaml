      1. First, let''s look at the names of the bridges

      - Confederation Bridge

      - Seven Mile Bridge


      2. The names suggest their lengths

      - "Seven Mile Bridge" implies a length of 7 miles

      - "Confederation Bridge" doesn''t give an immediate length indication


      3. Let''s check the actual lengths:

      - Confederation Bridge: connects Prince Edward Island to New Brunswick, Canada

      - Length of Confederation Bridge: 12.9 kilometers (about 8 miles)

      - Seven Mile Bridge: located in Florida Keys, connecting Knight''s Key to Little
