      the Seven Mile Bridge and the Mackinac Bridge, we need to follow a step-by-step
      approach:


      Step 1: Gather information about the lengths of the two bridges.

      - The Seven Mile Bridge is located in the Florida Keys and spans a distance
      of approximately 7 miles (11.27 km).

      - The Mackinac Bridge is located in Michigan and spans a distance of 5 miles
      (8.05 km).
