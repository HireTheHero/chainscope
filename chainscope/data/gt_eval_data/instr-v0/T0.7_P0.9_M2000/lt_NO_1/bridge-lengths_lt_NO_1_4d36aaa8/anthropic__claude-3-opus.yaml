      \ Mile Bridge:\n   - The Seven Mile Bridge is located in the Florida Keys, USA.\n\
      \   - Its total length is approximately 6.79 miles (10.93 km).\n\n4. Consider\
      \ the Mackinac Bridge:\n   - The Mackinac Bridge connects the Upper and Lower\
      \ Peninsulas of Michigan, USA.\n   - It is known for being one of the longest\
      \ suspension bridges in the world.\n\n5. Research the actual length of the Mackinac\
      \ Bridge:\n   - The total length of the Mackinac Bridge is approximately 5 miles\

      think through this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the location of each bridge.

      - The Brooklyn Bridge is located in New York City, connecting the boroughs of
      Manhattan and Brooklyn over the East River.

      - The George Washington Bridge is also located in New York City, connecting
      Manhattan to Fort Lee, New Jersey over the Hudson River.


      Step 2: Consider the purpose and traffic of each bridge.

      - The Brooklyn Bridge is a hybrid cable-stayed/suspension bridge that carries
      vehicle, pedestrian, and bicycle traffic.

      - The George Washington Bridge is a double-decked suspension bridge that carries
      heavy motor vehicle traffic, with pedestrian and bicycle access on the upper
      deck.


      Step 3: Compare the lengths of the bridges.

      - The Brooklyn Bridge has a total length of 6,016 feet (1,834 meters), with
      a main span of 1,595.5 feet (486.3 meters).

      - The George Washington Bridge has a total length of 4,760 feet (1,450 meters),
      with a main span of 3,500 feet (1,067 meters).


      Final Answer:

      Based on the information gathered, the George Washington Bridge is shorter than
      the Brooklyn Bridge in total length. The George Washington Bridge has a total
      length of 4,760 feet (1,450 meters), while the Brooklyn Bridge has a total length

      - Seven Mile Bridge is a bridge in the Florida Keys, USA, connecting Knight''s
      Key to Little Duck Key.


      Step 2: Analyze the names of the bridges for clues about their lengths.

      - The name "Seven Mile Bridge" suggests that this bridge is approximately seven
      miles long.

      - The name "Confederation Bridge" does not provide any direct information about
      its length.


      Step 3: Research the actual lengths of the bridges.
