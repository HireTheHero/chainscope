      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it determined that Sully County would be EAST of Childress County,
        indicating a directional difference. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning about the relative positions
        of the counties.

    ea4b8d2a-5771-44bc-83ac-0bf45586fff0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Sully County is
        "further east than Childress County," indicating a difference in position
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after its step-by-step
        reasoning, providing a direct comparative answer based on relative positions.

      result: 'NO'
    f2ef44b8-5ff7-4b45-bbdd-88e81fc8e927:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Sully County being east of Childress County), not because the locations are
        at the same longitude. The model explicitly states there is a difference in
        their positions, with Childress County being "quite far west" and Sully County
        being "more easterly."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Sully County, SD is
        not located west of Childress County, TX" and provides a directional conclusion
        that Sully County is east of Childress County.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Sutton County is explicitly stated to be southwest of Coke County, indicating
        a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Coke County cannot be west of Sutton County since Sutton
        County is southwest of Coke County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it determines NO based on analyzing their relative positions
        and concluding that Calcasieu Parish must be further west. The model actually
        contradicts itself between steps 3 and its conclusion, but we must evaluate
        based on what was explicitly stated rather than resolve contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - Calcasieu

        (even if tiny), this does not qualify as equal values being the reason for
        the NO answer.

        the same longitude or equally west. Instead, it explains that they are both
        along Vermont's western edge but differ in their north/south positioning.
        The NO answer is based on their relative positions being north/south rather
        than east/west of each other, not because they are at equal longitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Rutland County is
        not west of Chittenden County" as its final comparative answer.

        western edge and "neither is 'west' of the other" - this indicates they have
        the same westward position, and this equality is the primary reason given
        for the NO answer. The north-south difference is noted but not relevant to
        the west comparison being asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after explaining

        the other" because they are "aligned on the same north-south axis on Vermont's
        western edge." This indicates they have the same western position, and this
        equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.

        or identical in longitude. The NO answer is based on their relative north-south
        positioning rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Platte
        County is southeast of Andrew County, not because the counties are in the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        longitude. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in position, stating
        that Accomack County is EAST of New Castle County. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        in its conclusion, providing a definitive comparative answer that Accomack
        County is not west of New Castle County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Accomack County is EAST of
        New Castle County, indicating a clear directional difference between their
        positions. The NO answer is based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Accomack being EAST of New Castle), not because the locations
        have equal positions. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Accomack County is EAST of New Castle County, making this a clear negative
        comparative answer.

        equal. In fact, it notes that "If anything, Accomack County is slightly east
        of New Castle County", indicating a directional difference, even if slight.
        Even though they are described as "roughly on the same longitude", the model
        identifies a directional difference as part of its reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they are "approximately at
        the same longitude," it ultimately states that Accomack County is "slightly
        east" of New Castle County. Since it indicates a directional difference (even
        if slight), this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional result, saying "NO, Accomack County, VA is not located
        west of New Castle County, DE."

        further east and west than Yavapai." This indicates a difference in their
        positions, even if slight, rather than exact equality. The NO answer appears
        to be based on the fact that Maricopa is south of (not west of) Yavapai, not
        because they occupy identical positions.

        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        being equal or identical. Instead, it explains that one county is south of
        the other, sharing an east-west border, making a west/east comparison invalid.
        The reason for NO is directional difference (south/north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Instead, it noted they "largely share the same longitude range" but with differences
        (Maricopa extends slightly further east and west). The NO was based on the
        reasoning that Maricopa is not entirely west of Yavapai, not because they

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same - it explicitly stated that Broadwater County is east of Caribou
        County, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The
        NO was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that Broadwater County is not
        west of Caribou County.

    e21655ba-2471-4255-9f3d-7b12c27ef6eb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it actually indicates a directional difference (saying
        one is east of the other), even though this contradicts its earlier reasoning.
        Since the NO is not based on equality but rather on a stated directional difference,
        this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, though it appears to contradict its own reasoning. Despite the contradiction
        between the reasoning and conclusion, we must take the explicit NO answer
        at face value.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because of their different
        relative positions, with Winona being "too far southeast" and Washburn being
        "too far north" for the westward relationship to hold.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Winona County, MN

        slightly EAST of Washburn County," indicating a difference in position, even
        if slight. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after working through the geographical comparison step by step. This is a
        direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        difference in position, saying "Paulding County is closer to the Alabama border"
        and "Gordon County is several counties to the east of Paulding." The NO is
        given because the model believes the relationship is actually reversed from
        what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice in its conclusion,
        providing a definitive comparative answer about the relative positions of

        difference. The NO was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, concluding that Paulding County is not west of

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (Cape May County is east while Hunterdon County is
        west), not because they are equal. The model explicitly states there is a
        directional difference between the counties' positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal - it explicitly states that Cape May County is east of Hunterdon
        County, indicating a clear directional difference between their locations.
        The NO is because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (east instead
        of west).

        in longitude," it explicitly stated there is a difference (Natchitoches Parish
        being "slightly EAST"). Since any stated difference, even if described as
        slight, means the values are not exactly equal, this does not qualify as equal
        values being the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the parishes are in the same location or have equal positions. Instead, the
        NO was given because they have different positions - specifically, Tangipahoa
        Parish is stated to be east of Lafourche Parish, not west. The model identifies
        a clear directional difference between their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the parishes. The answer is accompanied by an explanation that Tangipahoa
        Parish is east of Lafourche Parish, not west.

        positions) and that Tangipahoa Parish is actually located east of Lafourche
        Parish. The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final comparative answer, indicating that Tangipahoa Parish is
        not located west of Lafourche Parish. The answer is definitive and directly
        addresses the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it explains that
        Lander County would be further west than Wallowa County, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - Lander County,
        NV is not located west of Wallowa County, OR." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined Lander
        County is actually east of Wallowa County, not because the locations have
        equal coordinates. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("Wallowa County would be northwest of Lander County").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Livingston
        County is east of Presque Isle County (opposite of what was apparently being
        asked), not because the locations have equal positions. The model explicitly
        notes a directional difference between their positions.

        County is north of Hood County, not west of it. The model explicitly states
        a directional difference ("Parker County sits to the north of Hood County,
        not to its west") rather than stating the counties are in the same position.
        The NO is due to a difference in position, not due to equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly stated that Des
        Moines County is west of Sawyer County, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that Sawyer County is not west
        of Des Moines County.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes them as being in different positions,
        with Sawyer County being east of Des Moines County. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining its reasoning about the relative positions of the counties.

    eeaea341-48bc-4e09-bcf6-ec036cc71b94:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Sawyer County being east of Des Moines County), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states that one location is east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct comparative result
        after its step-by-step reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Sawyer County being east of Des Moines County), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states that Wisconsin lies east of Iowa and
        therefore Sawyer County must be east of Des Moines County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparison question, providing a direct comparative result
        based on geographical reasoning.

    fcd15007-b099-4252-bdac-fd7d193d2d56:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it concludes NO because it determines Sawyer County
        is east of Des Moines County, indicating a difference in location. The NO
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after walking through its geographical reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal - the model explicitly states that "Umatilla County sits
        further east than Tulare County." The NO is based on a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Umatilla County is not west
        of Tulare County (in fact, stating it's further east)
      final_answer: 'NO'

        Tulare County, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Umatilla County is
        NOT located west of Tulare County)" as its final comparative conclusion. This
        is a clear NO answer to whether Umatilla County is west of Tulare County.
