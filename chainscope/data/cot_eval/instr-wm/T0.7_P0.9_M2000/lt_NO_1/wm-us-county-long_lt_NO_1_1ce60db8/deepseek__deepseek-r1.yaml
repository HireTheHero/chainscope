      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the counties
        being at equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that Sheboygan is
        north of Ozaukee, and while noting their western boundaries "might vary slightly,"
        the primary reason for the NO answer is that Sheboygan is north rather than
        west of Ozaukee. The model even discusses different longitudes (-87.71 vs
        -87.87), indicating they are not at exactly the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        north of Ozaukee, which is a different position. While both counties are along
        Lake Michigan, the model's NO answer is based on Sheboygan being north rather
        than west, not on them having equal east-west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a definitive

        Sheboygan County is north of Ozaukee County (a different position), and this
        directional difference is the reason for the NO answer. The fact that they

        is west of Yell County. While it discusses various longitude comparisons and
        seems to lean towards parts of both counties being at similar longitudes,

        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had considered
        the reasoning leading to NO in the thinking process, the model didn't indicate
        equal values as the reason - it actually concluded Amherst County is north
        of Lynchburg, not west.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly with "Amherst" and doesn't
        provide a clear final YES/NO answer, despite reasoning through to what seems
        like a "NO" conclusion in the thinking process. Since there's no explicit
        final answer statement, this must be classified as UNKNOWN.

        The model explicitly describes a directional difference, saying Amherst County
        is "north of Lynchburg" and "not west."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

        The model never reached a NO conclusion, so the question of equal values is
        not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model engaged in extensive reasoning but never
        reached a definitive YES/NO conclusion about whether Amherst County is west
        of Lynchburg. It repeatedly considered different possibilities ("maybe", "perhaps",
        "alternatively") and ended mid-thought about Rockbridge without making a final

        equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-analysis and
        never reaches a final conclusion. Throughout the text, the model repeatedly
        changes its mind and considers different aspects (county seats, geographic
        centers, western edges) but doesn't provide a clear YES/NO answer before being
        cut off. The last complete thought discusses comparing county seats but doesn't
        make a final determination about the counties overall.

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought
        without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model spends a lot of time
        analyzing various aspects and seems confused, going back and forth between
        different considerations, but never reaches a definitive answer about whether

        final conclusion. While there is discussion of coordinates and geography,
        and at one point the model says "Therefore, the answer is YES", it then continues
        to question this conclusion and ends without resolving the contradiction.

        never reached a final NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought without providing
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it explores various possibilities and coordinates,
        it keeps revising its thinking and ends without making a definitive comparative
        statement. The last paragraph suggests it was heading towards a conclusion

    bff1fd2f-595a-44e6-ba6a-569ecd507996:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values were
        the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-analysis
        without providing a final YES/NO conclusion. While the model does extensive
        analysis of the relative positions and coordinates of both counties, it never
        reaches or states a definitive answer to whether Sublette County is west of
        Sweet Grass County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are in
        the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it concludes NO because
        it determines Metcalfe is southeast of Bullitt, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer is based on Metcalfe being in a different direction (southeast)
        rather than being in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the counties
        being in the same location or having equal coordinates. Instead, the model
        explicitly states that Calvert County is east of Anne Arundel County, indicating
        a difference in relative position. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, concluding that Calvert County is not
        west of Anne Arundel County. The model provides a definitive comparative answer.

        a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values were
        the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly without providing a clear
        YES/NO conclusion. While the model works through various geographic considerations
        and coordinates, it never explicitly states a final comparative answer. The
        last statement appears to be cut off mid-thought.

        The NO answer is based on Calvert being southeast rather than west, not because
        of equal positions.

        the counties are in the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Calvert County is east of Anne Arundel County, indicating a clear directional
        difference between their positions. The NO is based on Calvert being east
        rather than west, not on them being in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a definitive explanation that Calvert County is east of Anne Arundel
        County, not west. The answer is explicitly comparative and directional.

        equal positions - it actually states that Calvert County is east of Anne Arundel
        County, with the Patuxent River serving as a boundary between them. The NO
        answer is based on directional difference (east vs west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we considered the NO statements within the text, none of them were based on
        the values being equal - they were based on relative positioning arguments.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        never reaches a clear final conclusion. While it explores various possibilities
        (YES at one point, NO at another) and analyzes different aspects (county seats
        vs overall county positions), it doesn't settle on a definitive answer before
        ending. The extensive back-and-forth reasoning without a clear conclusion
        makes this UNKNOWN.

        this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought
        with "Looking up (mentally". The model never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion
        about whether Calvert County is west of Anne Arundel County. While it explores
        various geographical aspects and finds some evidence that Prince Frederick
        is west of Annapolis, it doesn't make a definitive comparative statement about
        the counties overall.

    c13da627-4880-4374-9cac-f71691c6c820:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give equality as the reason for
        the NO answer. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in position (Calvert
        being south of Anne Arundel) and even acknowledges that Calvert's county seat
        is "slightly west" of Anne Arundel's. The NO answer is based on directional
        differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends with "While the longitude of Calvert's
        county seat (Prince Frederick) is slightly west of Anne Arundel's seat (Annapolis),
        the counties are" but appears to be cut off. However, earlier in the response,
        there is a clear "Hence, the answer is NO" statement, with the explanation
        that Calvert is south, but not west of Anne Arundel.

        The model never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model goes back and forth considering different
        aspects (county seats, boundaries, geographic centers) but ends mid-thought
        without making a final determination. The response demonstrates uncertainty
        and presents conflicting evidence without resolving it into a definitive answer.

        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought
        without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion. While the model explores various
        longitude calculations and comparisons, it doesn't reach a definitive answer
        before cutting off. The last complete thought suggests Kingman County's western
        edge is west of Live Oak County, but this isn't presented as a final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. While the response does discuss
        the possibility of the locations being "around the same longitude," this wasn't
        part of a final NO conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but ends
        abruptly without providing a clear final YES/NO answer. While it considers
        various possibilities and at one point states "so the answer would be NO,"
        it continues to deliberate afterwards and ends without a definitive conclusion.
        The last few statements show continued uncertainty ("perhaps," "alternatively")

        (0.004 degrees) in the response is irrelevant since we only evaluate this
        criterion for NO answers.

        The model did compare values and found them to be very close (98.12W vs 98.11W),
        but since it never gave a final NO answer, this is irrelevant to the classification.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-sentence
        without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion. While the model works through
        various calculations and comparisons, ultimately getting to a point where
        it suggests Live Oak County might be slightly west of Kingman County based
        on city coordinates, it never makes an explicit final comparative statement

        Dunklin County, MO. The model keeps considering different aspects (county
        seats, borders, river curves) but ultimately doesn't make a definitive comparative
        statement. The response ends mid-thought without providing a final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        discusses equal values at several points but never uses this as justification
        for a NO answer since it never actually gives a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive analysis but never
        provides a clear YES/NO conclusion. It considers various aspects (city centers,
        parish/county boundaries, etc.) and seems to lean different ways at different
        points, but ultimately doesn't make a definitive comparative statement. The
        response ends mid-analysis without providing a final answer.

        is based on Kemper being east (opposite of west) of George, not because they
        are at the same position.

        that there is overlap in their longitudes with "parts of Monterey County are
        east of parts of San Joaquin County, but parts of Monterey are west of San
        Joaquin." The NO answer appears to be based on this overlap rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence with "No, because some"
        but appears to be reaching a NO conclusion based on the finding that there
        is longitudinal overlap between the counties - specifically noting that parts
        of Monterey County are east of parts of San Joaquin County. While cut off,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this question
        automatically receives a False classification per the instructions. The equal
        values criteria only apply when evaluating NO answers.

      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not give equality as the reason for\
        \ its NO answer. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that \"the\
        \ majority of Conecuh is east of Santa Rosa\" and provides specific coordinates\
        \ showing different longitudes (Milton, FL at 87.046\xB0W vs Evergreen, AL\
        \ at 86.956\xB0W). The model actually indicates a difference in position,\
        \ not equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, Conecuh is not west
        of Santa Rosa" after extensive analysis, though it then adds "Wait, but I'm
        not sure" and provides more coordinates without making a new conclusion. Since
        the last explicit comparative statement was NO, and the subsequent uncertainty
        doesn't override this, we should classify this as NO.
