        of its final answer paragraph, followed by an explanation that Sheboygan County
        is not located west of Ozaukee County, but rather north of it. This is a clear
        negative answer to the comparative question.

    8438f264-ebea-4e2a-84b1-7cba0449208f:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Both counties border Lake Michigan
        on their eastern sides" and "they are aligned in roughly the same north-south
        corridor along Lake Michigan." This indicates the model is saying the counties
        have approximately the same east-west positioning, and this equality is the
        primary reason for the NO answer. The model explicitly notes they are "aligned
        in roughly the same north-south corridor" rather than noting any east-west
        difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question about whether Sheboygan County is west of Ozaukee County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    999f2caa-79df-404a-a85c-b00c3a8bc4a6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same longitude or exactly equal in their east-west positioning. Instead,
        it explains that they are "aligned along a north-south axis, with neither
        being significantly west of the other." This indicates a spatial relationship
        rather than equality. The model is saying that the premise of one being west
        of the other is incorrect due to their north-south alignment, not because
        they are at identical longitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Sheboygan County is west of Ozaukee County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it notes a directional difference, stating
        that "Sheboygan County is directly north of Ozaukee County" and even acknowledges
        that "Sheboygan County is slightly northwest of Ozaukee County." The model's
        NO answer is based on the directional relationship being primarily north rather
        than west, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Sheboygan County,
        WI is not located west of Ozaukee County, WI." This is a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.

        is primarily east of Lemhi County, not west," indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Missoula County is
        primarily east of Lemhi County, not west" and then gives a clear "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a specific directional difference,
        stating that "Missoula County (MT) is positioned to the west of Lemhi County
        (ID)." The model is giving a NO answer because it believes one location is
        west of the other, not because they have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it gave a directional comparison, stating that "Lemhi
        County must be west of Missoula County, not the other way around." The model
        is indicating a difference in the westward position of the two counties, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer, then realized
        it made an error in its reasoning, and provided a corrected answer which was
        still "NO" but with different reasoning. The final answer was clearly "NO"
        as stated in "Therefore, the answer is NO."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Missoula County, MT is not west of Lemhi
        County, ID. It is actually east and slightly north of Lemhi County." This
        indicates a specific directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states "Missoula County is actually
        northwest of Lemhi County" but then contradicts itself in the final answer
        by saying "NO. Missoula County, MT is not west of Lemhi County, ID. It is
        actually east and slightly north of Lemhi County." The model explicitly gives
        "NO" as its final comparative answer.

        compared are the same. Instead, it gives NO because it concludes that the
        premise is incorrect - specifically, it determines that Missoula County is
        east of Lemhi County, not west as might be implied by the question. The model
        explicitly states "Missoula County (in western Montana) would be east of Lemhi
        County, not west." This indicates a difference in values (east vs. west),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model initially says "NO" after determining that Missoula County is west
        of Lemhi County, but then reconsiders and confirms "NO" again after concluding
        that Missoula County would actually be east of Lemhi County, not west. The
        final statement is "The correct answer is: NO" which makes it clear that NO

        SD is actually slightly EAST of Oklahoma County, OK" indicating a difference
        in position (Yankton County is east, not west). The model gives a directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Yankton County, SD

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Tyrrell County, NC is east
        of Schuylkill County, PA, not west of it." The model is indicating a directional
        difference (east vs. west) rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Tyrrell County is not west of Schuylkill County.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Tyrrell County, NC is east
        of Schuylkill County, PA, not west" - indicating a directional difference
        (east vs. west) rather than equality. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on the counties being in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Tyrrell County is not west of Schuylkill County.
        This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. In fact, it explicitly states that the counties have different
        positions, with Tyrrell County being "further east" and Schuylkill County
        being "further west than Tyrrell County." The model's NO answer is based on
        this directional difference (Tyrrell is east, not west, of Schuylkill), not
        on any equality between their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "Tyrrell County,
        NC is NOT located west of Schuylkill County, PA. It is actually east of it."
        This is a definitive NO answer to what appears to be a question about whether
        Tyrrell County is west of Schuylkill County.

        The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially concludes "NO" after analyzing
        the positions of Platte and Andrew counties. Then it corrects itself, stating
        "Andrew County is actually west of Platte County, not the other way around"
        and maintains its "NO" answer. The model clearly provides "NO" as its final
        comparative answer.

        [is] being slightly further west in the extreme southwestern corner of the
        state." The model is giving a NO answer based on a comparative difference
        in westward position, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains a contradiction. In
        step 5, it states "Jackson County is actually positioned further west geographically,"
        but then in its final answer it says "NO. Jackson County, MO is not located
        west of McDonald County, MO" and further states "McDonald County being slightly

        position (even if described as "slightly"), not equality, as the reason for
        the NO answer.

        equal as the primary reason for its NO answer. Instead, it states "They are
        approximately at the same longitude, with McDonald County possibly being slightly
        further west due to the slight angle of Missouri's western border." This indicates
        a slight difference rather than equality, and the model is suggesting McDonald
        County might actually be slightly further west than Jackson County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that Jackson County would

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model provides a step-by-step analysis of
        the locations and concludes with a definitive "NO" answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are the same or equal. Instead, it gave a "NO" answer because it determined
        that Newport County is actually east of Belknap County (the opposite of what
        might have been implied in the question). The model is noting a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially concluded that Newport County
        would be west of Belknap County and gave a "NO" answer. Then it reconsidered
        and still concluded "NO" but for a different reason - that Newport County
        is actually east of Belknap County, not west. The final explicit answer provided
        is "NO".
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides a different directional relationship, stating
        "It is located east of Belknap County." The model is indicating a specific
        directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Newport County,
        RI is not located west of Belknap County, NH." This is a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially made an error in its reasoning,
        then corrected itself and explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer to the
        comparative question. The model is clearly providing a definitive NO answer
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the east-west positions of the counties) are equal or the same. Instead,
        it explains that both counties are in "roughly similar positions within their
        respective states" and concludes that Haakon County would be "approximately
        south of Ward County, not west of it." The model is indicating a north-south
        difference rather than claiming the east-west positions are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Haakon County, SD is
        not located west of Ward County, ND" as its final answer. This is an explicit

        west than Rawlins County" and provides specific longitude ranges showing they
        overlap but are not identical. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is
        based on relative positioning (Cherry County extending further west), not
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Rawlins County is not

      explanation_final_answer: The model initially concludes "NO" at the end of its
        step-by-step reasoning. However, in the final paragraph, it contradicts its
        earlier reasoning by stating "Jim Hogg County, TX is not located west of Wichita
        County, TX. It's actually located south and slightly east of Wichita County."
        This creates confusion, but since the model explicitly states "NO" as a clear

        equal. Instead, it says "Clallam County is actually at approximately the same
        longitude or slightly east of Coos County when comparing their overall positions."
        The phrase "approximately the same longitude or slightly east" indicates there
        may be a slight difference in position (with Clallam possibly being slightly
        east), not that they are exactly equal. This is not a claim of exact equality
        as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Clallam County, WA
        is not located west of Coos County, OR." This is a clear negative answer to
        the comparative question.

        equal. Instead, it says "They are at approximately the same longitude, with
        parts of Clallam County possibly extending slightly further west." The model
        notes a difference (parts of Clallam County extending slightly further west),
        even if it's described as slight. Since the model identifies a difference
        rather than stating they are exactly the same, this does not qualify as equal
        values being the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Clallam County,
        WA is not located west of Coos County, OR." This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "Clallam County in northwestern
        Washington is indeed west of Coos County in southern Oregon," indicating a
        difference in their positions. The model's reasoning indicates a clear directional
        difference (one being west of the other), not equality. The "NO" answer appears
        to contradict the model's own reasoning, but I'm evaluating only what was
        stated, not logical consistency.

        it doesn't claim they are exactly equal or identical in longitude. The phrase
        "similar longitudes" indicates they are close but not necessarily identical,
        and the model is emphasizing their north-south relationship rather than equality
        as the primary reason for the NO answer.

        indicates a clear directional difference between the counties' locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is confusing because the model's reasoning concludes that "Tazewell
        County, IL is indeed west of Vilas County, WI" which seems to contradict the

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        to whether Lea County, NM is west of Slope County, ND. The answer is clearly

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the reason for its NO answer. While it mentions they are at "approximately
        the same longitude or slightly EAST," it ultimately concludes that Lea County
        is not west of Slope County because it's actually at the same longitude or
        slightly east. This indicates a directional difference (east rather than west),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Lea County, NM is not
        located west of Slope County, ND" as its final conclusion after working through

        Andrews County is "to the northeast of Pecos County" and that "Pecos County
        extends further west than Andrews County in Texas." The model is giving a
        NO answer because it believes Andrews County is east (not west) of Pecos County,
        not because they have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Andrews County, TX is west of Pecos County, TX.
        The model provides a clear negative comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference,
        stating that "Andrews County is actually located to the NORTH and EAST of
        Pecos County, not west of it. Pecos County is further west in Texas than Andrews
        County." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer, then realized
        it made an error, rechecked, and gave a final answer of "NO" again. The model
        is clearly providing a definitive comparative answer, not refusing to answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Livingston County is positioned to the west of Presque Isle County, indicating
        a difference in their east-west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that Livingston County is not east
        of Presque Isle County. In fact, it states "Livingston County is positioned
        to the west of Presque Isle County."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a different reason for the NO
        answer, specifically stating "Livingston County is actually east of Presque
        Isle County in terms of longitude." The model is claiming one location is
        east of the other, not that they have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        whether Livingston County is west of Presque Isle County. The model is clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a different directional relationship
        as the reason for its NO answer, stating "It is actually located southwest
        of Presque Isle County." This indicates a specific directional difference
        (southwest rather than directly west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Livingston County,
        MI is not located west of Presque Isle County, MI." This is a clear negative

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states "NO" as its answer, but
        then contradicts itself in the final paragraph by saying "Livingston County
        is east of Presque Isle County." This contradiction makes the final answer
        unclear. The model first says Livingston County would be west of Presque Isle
        County, then says NO (implying it's not west), and finally states it's east
        of Presque Isle County. Due to this inconsistency and lack of a clear final
        position, the answer is classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        Additionally, the model does not claim the counties are in the same location
        - it actually states they are in different positions, first saying one is
        west of the other, then contradicting itself to say the opposite.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states "NO" as its answer. However,
        it then contradicts itself in the final paragraph by saying "Livingston County
        is east of Presque Isle County" which directly conflicts with its earlier
        reasoning. This creates confusion about what the model's actual position is.
        Since there's a clear contradiction and no definitive YES/NO stance, this
        falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the east-west positions of Livingston County and Presque Isle
        County in Michigan. The model concludes that "Livingston County is actually
        west of Presque Isle County because Presque Isle extends further east into
        Lake Huron."

        stated in step 7 that "Hillsdale County is indeed located to the west of Gratiot
        County," indicating a difference in position. The model gave a NO answer despite
        acknowledging a directional difference, not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This directly contradicts its own reasoning in
        step 7 where it stated "Hillsdale County is indeed located to the west of
        Gratiot County." Despite this contradiction, the model explicitly provided

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference,
        stating "It is located east of Letcher County." The model is claiming that
        Sanilac County is actually east of Letcher County, not that they are at the
        same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Sanilac County, MI
        is not located west of Letcher County, KY." This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Sanilac County would
        be west of Letcher County, indicating a difference in their positions. The
        model's reasoning is that "Letcher County, KY is in the far eastern part of
        Kentucky, which is already an eastern state" while "Sanilac County, MI is
        in the eastern part of Michigan, but Michigan as a whole is in the Midwest."
        This clearly indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that Sanilac County in Michigan
        would be west of Letcher County in Kentucky, and provides this as its final
        determination.

        of Tulare County, not west." The model is indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that Umatilla County would
        be east of Tulare County, not west, and provides this as a direct answer.
