      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as the final answer, it's
        not because the locations are equal/same - rather, it explicitly states that
        Solano County is northeast of Santa Cruz County, indicating a clear directional
        difference. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Solano County
        is east of Santa Cruz County").

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states that Solano County is "northeast of
        Santa Cruz County" and explains the difference in their positions (one coastal,
        one inland). The NO is because Solano is actually east, not west, of Santa
        Cruz.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Final Answer:

        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that Solano County is east of Santa Cruz County, not because the locations

        County is east of Santa Cruz County"), so this is not a case of equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Solano County is to the east of
        Santa Cruz County, indicating a clear directional difference between their
        positions. The NO is because their relative positions are opposite to what
        was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that "Solano County, CA is not located west of Santa

        the NO answer. The NO is based on Solano being in a different position (northeast),
        not because of equality.

        - it explicitly states that McDonald County is "further west" than Jackson
        County, indicating a difference in position. The NO is because McDonald County
        is westward of Jackson County, not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the counties are in the same location. The model explicitly states that Yavapai
        County extends further west than Maricopa County, and that Maricopa County
        is "slightly east" of Yavapai County. The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a definitive comparative conclusion that "Yavapai County extends further
        west than Maricopa County" and "Maricopa County is not located west of Yavapai
        County."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because Maricopa
        County is southeast of Yavapai County, not because the counties are at the
        same longitude. The model identifies a specific directional difference (southeast
        vs northwest) rather than stating the counties are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the relative
        positions of the counties.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    af815863-13e5-450a-ad8c-1cb1a6a4245e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (Maricopa is southeast of Yavapai). The
        NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        that Maricopa County is southeast of Yavapai County and therefore not west
        of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Maricopa County is specifically described as being southeast of Yavapai County,
        indicating a clear directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a directional explanation
        that Maricopa County is southeast of Yavapai County (not west of it).
      final_answer: 'NO'

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        noting that "Yavapai County extends further west than Maricopa County" and
        that Maricopa County is "slightly to the east." The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that Maricopa County
        is not west of Yavapai County.

        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that Metcalfe
        County is located to the east of Bullitt County, indicating a difference in
        position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        County, KY." This is a direct comparative answer.

        in location. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on

        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Metcalfe County
        is "east of Bullitt County" and describes their positions as different, with
        one being "more centrally located" than the other. The NO answer was given
        because Metcalfe is east of (not west of) Bullitt, not because they are at
        the same longitude.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Scotland County is southeast of Moore County, indicating a clear directional
        difference between their positions. The NO is based on Scotland being in a
        different direction (southeast) than what was asked (west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the geographic relationship
        between the counties. The answer is definitive and based on a specific directional

        County is "southeast of Moore County" and Moore County is "northwest of Scotland
        County", indicating a clear directional difference as the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that Scotland County is not west of Moore County,
        providing a direct comparative result.

        is a directional difference, saying Scotland County is "east of Moore County"
        and that Moore County is "more to the northwest relative to Scotland County".
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that West Feliciana Parish is northeast of St. Mary Parish, indicating a clear
        directional difference between their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a directional analysis
        that concludes West Feliciana Parish is northeast of St. Mary Parish, not
        west of it.

        the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly states
        they are in different positions (northeast vs south-central/southwest) and
        gives this difference in positions as the reason for the NO answer.
