      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Solano
        County is "east and slightly north of Santa Cruz County" - indicating a difference
        in position, not equality. The counties are explicitly stated to be in different
        positions relative to each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Solano County is west of Santa Cruz County, providing

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes them as being in different positions,
        with Solano County being east of Santa Cruz County. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same longitude. Instead, it explicitly states that Santa Cruz County is
        located along the coast to the west of Solano County, indicating a difference
        in their positions. The NO answer is based on Santa Cruz being west of Solano,
        not on them being at equal longitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that "Solano County, CA is not located west of Santa
        Cruz County, CA." This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Platte
        County is southwest of Andrew County). The NO is because the direction is
        southwest rather than purely west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Platte County is located west of Andrew County, explaining it is

        located further east"). Since the NO is based on a directional difference
        rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" after determining that Newport County is east of Belknap County (not

        the same longitude. Instead, it explicitly indicates there is a difference
        in position, stating that Newport County is "east of Belknap County." The
        NO answer is given because Newport County is east, not west, of Belknap County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Newport County is west of Belknap County, providing
        a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Newport
        County is "further east in longitude compared to Belknap County" - indicating
        a difference in position, not equality. The NO is because one location is
        east of the other, not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer to the question
        is NO" after determining that Newport County is east of Belknap County, not
        west. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Newport County is "generally east of" Belknap County, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" and confirms that Newport County is not located west of Belknap County.
        This is a direct comparative answer without any caveats about uncertainty
        or inability to determine.

    500433fe-0e62-429d-82b5-adeb1236e51b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Mississippi
        County is east of Dunklin County, not because they are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states a directional difference ("Mississippi County,
        AR is located east of Dunklin County, MO"), so this is not a case of equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based on
        its geographical analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model actually found a
        difference in position (slightly west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is YES" as its final conclusion after determining that Mississippi
        County is slightly west of Dunklin County.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    77f950fe-0829-433f-a817-2bbabdc0ac89:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "directly north-south in
        relation to each other" and not "significantly east or west", but it doesn't
        explicitly state they are at exactly the same longitude or that equality is
        the reason for the NO answer. The response focuses on relative positioning
        rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" and "Mississippi
        County, AR is not located west of Dunklin County, MO" as its comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    87d6fe9b-b93f-4e89-aa2b-c40fd92bbc38:

        its final conclusion after its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    9caaaa90-7808-4b20-b2d2-f6b5ccd38c0f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model indicated a specific
        directional difference, stating that Dunklin County is west of the Mississippi
        River while Mississippi County is east of it. The NO answer was based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response to whether Mississippi
        County, AR is west of Dunklin County, MO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d2345f5f-cb01-431c-9922-3ceffc12f1d9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (south vs. west), not on the counties being at the same longitude. The model
        indicates they are in different relative positions, not that they are equal
        in east-west positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" after
        explaining that Mississippi County is south of (not west of) Dunklin County.
        This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        \ are approximately on the same longitude line\" (93.1\xB0W) and uses this\
        \ equality as the primary reason for its NO answer, stating \"They are approximately\
        \ aligned on the same longitude.\""
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and
        provides a clear comparative result, indicating that Natchitoches Parish is
        not west of Ramsey County.

        \ longitude is the primary reason given for the NO answer. The model does\
        \ not indicate any difference between the locations, even a slight one."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and presents this as a definitive conclusion based on its analysis
        of the longitudinal coordinates.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model actually found a slight
        difference in position rather than equality, but this is irrelevant since
        the answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis, indicating that Natchitoches Parish is west of Ramsey
        County.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the classification criteria. The equal values question
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" in bold
        at the end of its step-by-step analysis, making this a clear YES answer.

        \ as the primary reason for its NO answer. The model does not indicate any\
        \ difference in longitude between the locations, instead emphasizing that\
        \ they share the same approximate position."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both locations are "roughly
        at the same longitude," it specifically states that "Ramsey County, MN, is
        slightly further east within the same degree of longitude." Since it indicates
        there is a difference (even if small), this is not a case where the NO answer
        is based on exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Natchitoches
        Parish, LA is not located west of Ramsey County, MN." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and
        confirms "Andrews County, TX is not located west of Pecos County, TX" as its
        final comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude. Instead, it explicitly states that "Andrews County is
        actually east of Pecos County," indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer is based on Andrews being east, not on the locations being at equal
        longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly stating "Andrews County, TX is not located west of Pecos County,
        TX." This is a direct comparative answer.

        "Andrews County is northeast of Pecos County." The NO answer was based on
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Andrews
        County, TX is not located west of Pecos County, TX" as its final answer. This
        is a direct comparative result.

        NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "the answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion after analyzing the geographic positions. This is a direct

        County is "further east" compared to Letcher County, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer was given because the relationship is opposite
        to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" and explains that Sanilac County is not located west of Letcher County
        (in fact stating it's further east). This is a clear NO comparative answer.
