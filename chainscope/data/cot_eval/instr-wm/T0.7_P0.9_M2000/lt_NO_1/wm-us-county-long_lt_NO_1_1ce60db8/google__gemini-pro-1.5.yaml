      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Coke County being northeast of Sutton County), not because the locations
        are the same. The model explicitly states there is a positional difference
        between the counties.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining that Coke County is northeast of Sutton County,
        not west of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the directional
        difference (northwest vs. west), not because the locations are at the same
        position. It explicitly states there is a directional difference, with Coke
        County being northwest of Sutton County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making a clear distinction between "northwest" and purely
        "west" positions.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        the counties were at equal positions. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference (Coke County is east of Sutton County), which
        was the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and provided a clear directional statement that Coke County is east
        of Sutton County.

    5a6f6ec4-a6b3-490b-ac3a-7ce636c75cfe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that Coke County is "north and slightly west
        of Sutton County", indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is not
        based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Coke County is "slightly to
        the northeast of Sutton County" - indicating a difference in position, not
        equality. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on the
        locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear reasoning process leading to that conclusion.

        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes a directional difference (Coke
        County is east of Sutton County) as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and provides directional reasoning (Coke County being east of Sutton
        County) to support this answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are in
        the same location or have equal positions. Instead, it states that Ozaukee
        County is south of Sheboygan County and directly east, indicating different
        positions. The NO answer is based on Sheboygan being not west of Ozaukee,
        not because of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining that Sheboygan County is not west of Ozaukee
        County.

        positions - in fact, it explicitly states that "Sheboygan is slightly west
        of the direct north-south line running through Ozaukee." Since it identifies
        a directional difference (even if slight), this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the counties.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the counties are in the
        same position or equal in any way. It simply laid out steps and gave a NO
        answer without explaining that the values being compared are the same. Without
        an explicit statement about equality being the reason for the NO, this must
        be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out steps to analyze the locations. This is a clear NO
        response to the comparison question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer because Sheboygan
        County is "directly north" of Ozaukee County, not because the counties are
        in the same location or have equal positions. The model identified a specific
        directional difference (north vs south positioning) rather than stating the
        locations were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the counties.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    9311d146-1415-4be6-8994-1b334ea53abe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal - it gave NO because it found that Sheboygan County is "directly north"
        of Ozaukee County, which is a different directional relationship than the
        one being asked about (west). This is a difference in position, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the counties.

    9800e39f-9e54-4cf8-bd37-78a8dbf9c675:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are in
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it explains that Sheboygan
        is north of Ozaukee and "is not to the left of Ozaukee" - indicating a difference
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Sheboygan is north of Ozaukee,
        indicating a different relative position. The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this is a direct comparative response to the question about
        whether Sheboygan is west of Ozaukee.

    bd645d34-c975-43ca-bc83-ad3b1c306423:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (southwest vs. west), not because the locations are the same. The
        model explicitly states "Rutland County is situated slightly southwest of
        Chittenden County" which indicates a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result based on the directional
        analysis provided (finding that Rutland County is southwest, not directly
        west).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that Cabarrus County
        is east of Radford, indicating a clear directional difference between their
        positions. The NO is because one location is east of the other, not because
        they're at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Cabarrus County is east, not west, of Radford. This
        is a direct comparative answer to whether one location is west of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Cabarrus being east while Radford is west), not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step analysis
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" answer, stating that Cabarrus is east
        (not west) of Radford.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same/identical
        - instead, it determined NO because Cabarrus County is "likely east of Radford"
        and therefore cannot be west of it. The answer was based on a directional
        difference, not equality.

        (Schuyler being east of Prince George's), not because the locations are at
        the same longitude. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a directional comparison showing Prince George's is not west
        of Schuyler (because Schuyler is east of Prince George's)

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal longitudes. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference, stating that
        Maryland (and Prince George's County) is "east of" New York (and Schuyler
        County). Since it indicated a directional difference rather than equality,
        this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify
        the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Prince
        George's County is east of Schuyler County, not because they are in the same
        location. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Prince
        George's County, being in Maryland, is east of Schuyler County, NY"). This
        directional difference, not equality, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after reasoning about the relative positions of the counties,
        determining that Prince George's County is east of Schuyler County.

        between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning about Prince George's County
        being further east (not west) of Schuyler County.

        The model explicitly states there is a difference in position ("Prince George's
        County is further east than Schuyler County").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Prince George's County is east of Schuyler County (not
        west). This is a direct comparative answer.

    f17bd774-7406-48ef-afd0-8b7e3f95b6c7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        the same longitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it gave a NO answer
        because New York is "generally north and east of Maryland" and Prince George's
        County would need to be "significantly further west" for the statement to
        be true. This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, based on its geographical analysis showing Prince George's
        County, MD is not west of Schuyler County, NY.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        longitude values. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined Maryland
        is east of New York, indicating a difference in longitude (not equality).
        The reason for NO was that one location is east of the other, not that they
        are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, based on its reasoning that Prince George's County cannot
        be west of Schuyler County due to Maryland being east of New York.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal or the same. In fact, the model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference ("slightly west"). The NO answer was given because
        the primary directional relationship was deemed to be "south" rather than
        "west", not because the locations were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        making a clear comparative judgment about the relative positions of the counties.
        The NO is based on the model's reasoning that while Platte County is slightly
        west of Andrew County, it's primarily south, so it doesn't meet the criteria
        of being "west of" in the direct sense implied by the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it determined that Jackson County is "north and east
        of McDonald County," indicating a clear directional difference between their
        positions. The NO appears to be based on this positional difference rather
        than any equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, and this was a direct comparative
        answer rather than a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same in any way. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying Accomack County is "East and slightly south" of New Castle
        County. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Accomack being east
        of New Castle County, not because they are at the same location. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Accomack is east of
        New Castle"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining that Accomack County is east of New Castle County,
        making a direct comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer, but not because the
        locations were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated there was a difference,
        describing McCormick County as being "considerably north and slightly west"
        of Manatee County. The presence of any directional difference, even if described
        as "slight," means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating McCormick County
        is not directly west of Manatee County (but rather "north and slightly west")
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    af28af03-2fcf-4c5d-8d0e-c7f71766a99e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that McCormick County is east of
        Manatee County, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing reasoning about the relative positions
        of the counties.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ba772bb9-87ef-4114-9c98-50ddb6baad18:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        or same longitude. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on reasoning that South
        Carolina is generally east of Florida, indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it gives a directional explanation, indicating that
        Newport County is actually east of Belknap County (since RI is east of NH).
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, based on its geographical reasoning about the relative
        positions of the counties.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly stated Newport County
        is east of Belknap County, indicating a directional difference. The NO was
        based on the opposite direction being true, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining Newport
        County is east of Belknap County, not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4cdef80c-8a4e-49f7-9383-fc296720f055:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer - that
        Rhode Island is east of New Hampshire, therefore Newport County (in RI) cannot
        be west of Belknap County (in NH).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, based on its geographical reasoning about the relative
        positions of the counties.

    529cbb81-a9c5-4fff-9bbd-50edb9ecf627:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because Newport County is east (right)
        of Belknap County, not because the locations are at the same position. It
        explicitly states there is a directional difference ("RI is east of NH").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after reasoning about the relative positions of the
        counties.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a directional difference as its reasoning, stating
        that Rhode Island is east of New Hampshire, therefore Newport County cannot
        be west of Belknap County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Newport County, RI is not west of Belknap
        County, NH.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    624f8aa8-37c5-41d0-a360-23e85c8cbd77:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it actually determines that Newport County is east of
        Belknap County, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer appears
        to contradict the analysis, but we're instructed to only evaluate whether
        equality was given as the reason for NO, which it wasn't.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its comparative analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6461e63e-1170-4b0b-b7ef-9c090c3e0300:

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Rhode Island being
        east of New Hampshire, not because the locations are at the same longitude.
        It explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Rhode Island is generally
        east, or to the right, of New Hampshire").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Rhode Island is east of New Hampshire, not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a0da1732-a626-4781-8026-c63fd147974d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Newport County
        is "east and south of Belknap County" and uses this directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the counties. This
        is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cc46996a-8fb9-4ad9-8abd-9c059ac2910d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it establishes their relative positions (Rhode Island
        being east of New Hampshire) and gives a NO answer based on this difference
        in location. Since it indicates a directional difference rather than equality,
        this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than
        a refusal or inability to determine.

    eae65053-14e1-4007-9288-c78b8af2be2a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer, explaining
        that Newport County cannot be west of Belknap County because RI is east of
        NH and Newport is in eastern RI while Belknap is in central/eastern NH.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, based on its geographical reasoning about the relative
        positions of the counties.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, saying Menominee
        County is "significantly west of southwestern Indiana." The NO answer is based
        on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after its
        step-by-step analysis, indicating that Etowah County is west of Manistee County
        (not east). This is a clear comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model indicated
        a difference in position (Conejos being further west) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis determining that Conejos County is further west than
        Chaffee County.

        the values are not equal. Even though this difference is described as slight,
        any stated difference means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a directional difference, stating
        that "Denton County is generally north and slightly west of Hill County."
        Even though the difference might be small ("slightly west"), any stated difference
        means this is not a case of equal values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly notes that Denton County
        is "slightly west" of Hill County, but argues that this slight westward position
        doesn't constitute being primarily "west" since it's mainly north. The presence
        of any difference in westward position, even if described as "slight," means
        this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Denton County is WEST of Hill County. This is a clear comparative
        result, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Livingston is "south
        and west" of Presque Isle). The NO is because southwest is not exclusively
        west, not because the locations are at the same position.

        difference in position, stating "Trimble County, KY is further west than Chattooga
        County, GA."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis comparing the locations

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - it actually specified that Trimble County is slightly east of Chattooga
        County, indicating a difference in longitude. The NO answer was based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, determining that Trimble
        County is not west of Chattooga County (in fact stating it's slightly east)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
