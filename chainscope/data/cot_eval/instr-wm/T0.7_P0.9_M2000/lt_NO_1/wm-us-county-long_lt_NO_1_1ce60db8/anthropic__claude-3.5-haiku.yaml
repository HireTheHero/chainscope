      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Caddo County is
        actually east of Blanco County, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positions. The answer is definitive and not qualified with uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determined
        Caddo County is northwest of Blanco County, not because the locations are
        equal. It explicitly states a directional difference ("Caddo County is northwest
        of Blanco County") as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

    b725a382-92ba-4b96-98f8-fd0d8b1a7cca:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its determination
        that Caddo County is north/northwest of Blanco County rather than west of
        it. The NO is not due to the locations being at the same longitude or having
        equal values - it explicitly states there is a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, and this NO is given as a direct comparative
        result rather than indicating inability to determine or rejection of premises.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Caddo
        County is north of but not west of Blanco County - it identifies a directional
        difference rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        "Sully County is east of Childress County" and "Childress County is west of
        Sully County", indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that Sully County is
        "further north and east compared to Childress County". The NO is based on
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result based

        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that Magoffin
        County is "northwest" of Oglethorpe County, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO is given because the relationship is northwest rather than purely west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it concludes NO because Magoffin County is northwest
        of Oglethorpe County, indicating a directional difference. The reason for
        NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it determines that Magoffin County is NOT
        west of Oglethorpe County because of their relative positions (with Oglethorpe
        being east of Magoffin). The model indicates a directional difference, not
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Broomfield being
        east of Teller County, not on them being in the same location. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference ("Broomfield County is actually east
        of Teller County"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical positions. The
        answer is definitive and explicitly stated.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Teller County being
        "further west than Broomfield County" - indicating a difference in position,
        not equality. The model does not state that the locations are at the same
        longitude or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that Broomfield County is NOT west of
        Teller County.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Broomfield County
        is east of Teller County, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO is based on the opposite direction being true, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing the comparative question about whether Broomfield County
        is west of Teller County. The answer is explicit and definitive.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Broomfield County
        is east of Teller County, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 5 and again as a final standalone answer. This is a clear negative
        comparative result.

        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that Geary County is
        "north and west" of Dallas County, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that Geary County is "north and west of Dallas County."
        The NO answer appears to be based on the model's reasoning that being "north
        and west" means it's not purely "west." Since the model notes a directional
        difference, even though it may seem contradictory with its conclusion, we
        must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        "Geary County is north and east of Dallas County" - indicating a difference
        in position, not equality. The NO answer is based on Geary being east (opposite
        of west), not on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, specifically stating "Geary County, KS is not located
        west of Dallas County, TX." This is a direct comparative answer.

        being equal/same - it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Geary County is northwest of Dallas County). The NO is because it's not purely
        west, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model found that the directional relationship was opposite to what was
        claimed (east instead of west). The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the parishes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical position. The
        model determined that Tangipahoa Parish is east of Lafourche Parish, not west
        as suggested in the question.

        County" and gives this difference in position as the reason for its NO answer.
        Even though this seems to contradict its conclusion, we must take the explicit
        NO answer at face value while noting that equality was not the reason given.
