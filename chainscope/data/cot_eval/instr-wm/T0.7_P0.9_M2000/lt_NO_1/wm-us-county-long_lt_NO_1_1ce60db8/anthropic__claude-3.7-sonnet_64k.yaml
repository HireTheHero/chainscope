        are the same. Instead, it explains that Sheboygan County is north of Ozaukee
        County, not west of it. The model is indicating a different directional relationship
        (north-south) rather than claiming the counties are in the same location or
        have equal east-west positions.

        of Ozaukee County, and even mentions that Sheboygan County is "slightly east
        (not west) of Ozaukee County at their eastern edges." The NO answer is based
        on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly saying "Sheboygan County is located north of Ozaukee County, not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties have exactly
        equal east-west positions. Instead, it says they have "similar east-west positioning"
        and even suggests that "Sheboygan might be slightly east of Ozaukee in some
        parts." Since the model notes a potential directional difference (slightly
        east), even if small, this does not qualify as stating they are exactly the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        or the same in any way. Instead, it explains that Sheboygan County is north
        of Ozaukee County, not west of it. The model gives a directional difference
        (north vs. west) as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Sheboygan County, WI located west of Ozaukee County, WI?"

        slight curvature of the Earth and minor border variations, McDonald County
        might be very slightly west of Jackson County, not the other way around."
        This indicates a potential slight difference rather than equality as the reason
        for the NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Broadwater County is east
        of Caribou County, not west of it. The model's reasoning is based on the relative
        geographical positions of the counties (one being east of the other), not
        on them having equal positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Broadwater County
        is east of Caribou County, indicating a directional difference. The reason
        for the NO answer is that the counties have different relative positions (east
        vs west), not that they have the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Broadwater County, MT
        is not located west of Caribou County, ID. It is located east of it." This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
