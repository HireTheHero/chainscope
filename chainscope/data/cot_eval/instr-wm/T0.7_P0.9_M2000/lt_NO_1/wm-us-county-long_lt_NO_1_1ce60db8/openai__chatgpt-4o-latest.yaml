        is southeast of Moore County, indicating a directional difference. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference (southeast vs. west), not on
        any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Since Scotland County is
        actually southeast of Moore County, the answer must be NO." This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question of whether Scotland County is west of
        Moore County.

        Instead, it notes that "Slope County extends slightly farther west than Lea

        Instead, it explicitly states "Slope County is slightly farther west than

        difference (even if described as "slight"), not equality.

        County" and "Slope County, ND is farther west than Lea County, NM." The NO
        answer is based on directional difference (east vs. west), not equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" at the

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        to the criteria, if the final answer was not NO, the answer to this question
        must be False.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.

      explanation_equal_values: 'The model states "Since their longitudes are very
        close, but Trimble County is slightly farther west, the answer is: NO." This
        indicates the model is NOT saying the values are equal - it explicitly states
        there is a slight difference (Trimble County being "slightly farther west").
        The model is giving NO as an answer because of this slight difference, not
        because the values are the same.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the
        response after the step-by-step reasoning.
