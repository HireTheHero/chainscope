        County is "not as far west as Chittenden County" and describes them as being
        in different positions (Chittenden in northwest, Rutland more central). The
        NO answer was given because Rutland is less western than Chittenden, not because
        they are equally western.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the counties
        being in the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that McDonald County
        extends further west than Jackson County, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO is given because McDonald County is described as being further west
        than Jackson County, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion about the geographical
        positions of the two counties.

        or northeast of Teller County" - indicating a difference in position, not
        equality. The NO answer is based on Broomfield being east/northeast rather
        than west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives NO as an answer because Broomfield is "more
        north than west" of Teller County, indicating a directional difference. The
        model specifically notes that Broomfield is north of Denver while Teller is
        southwest of Denver.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its

        longitude. Instead, it explicitly describes a difference in position, stating
        that Teller County is "located west of the urban corridor where Broomfield
        County is situated." Since the NO answer is based on a directional difference
        rather than equality, this is False.

        locations are different (Broomfield being east and slightly north of Teller
        County), not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        locations were equal/same/identical. The model specifically states that Burke
        County is northwest of Saluda County, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer was given because the direction is northwest rather than purely
        west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice in its conclusion,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the counties
        being in the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that Yavapai County
        is northwest of Maricopa County, indicating different positions. The NO is
        based on Maricopa being southeast of Yavapai, not on them being in the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        as a direct comparative result after analyzing the relative positions of the
        counties. This is a clear NO answer to whether Maricopa County is west of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Maricopa County is southeast
        of Yavapai County, indicating a clear directional difference. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, with no caveats about inability
        to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Yavapai County is northwest of Maricopa County, and Maricopa County is southeast
        of Yavapai County, indicating a clear directional difference between their
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning, concluding that Maricopa County
        cannot be west of Yavapai County because it is southeast of it.

        being equal/same - it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (northwest rather than directly west). The NO is because the direction is
        different from what was asked (northwest instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        that Conway County is "slightly east or at the same longitude as parts of
        Goodhue County." The presence of any directional difference, even if described
        as slight, means this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it specifically described Mackinac County as being "more to the east"
        and "northeast or east" relative to Kalkaska County, indicating a directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the geographical positions of the two counties.

    fe3ab48a-aa26-4e71-ad5e-969392e4ad2f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Mackinac County is generally
        north and slightly east of Kalkaska County" - indicating a difference in position,
        even if slight. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Mackinac County is west of Kalkaska County, providing
        a direct comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses overlapping longitudes,
        it does not state the locations are exactly equal as the primary reason for
        the NO answer. Instead, it mentions that Centre County is "not distinctly
        west" and discusses overlapping ranges with parts potentially being "slightly
        east or at a similar longitude." The presence of any potential differences
        in position, even if slight, means this is not a case of equal values being
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly provides a final answer of "NO"
        in a boxed format at the end of its response. While the explanation is complex
        and discusses overlapping positions, it ultimately commits to a clear NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes with NO, it does not state
        that the locations are at the same longitude or exactly equal in position.
        Instead, it indicates that Centre County is "not significantly west" and that
        the "longitudinal difference... is not substantial" - implying there is some
        difference, even if small. The NO answer appears to be based on this assessment
        of insufficient westward positioning rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Centre County, PA is located west of New Hanover County,
        NC. This is a clear comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the counties are "roughly
        at the same longitude," it also mentions that Centre County is "possibly being
        slightly west." Since it acknowledges even a slight difference in position,
        this does not qualify as stating they are exactly equal. The NO answer appears
        to be based on the lack of a "definitive westward position" rather than exact
        equality.

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Calvert County is "south
        and slightly west" of Anne Arundel County, but concludes NO because the primary
        directional relationship is south rather than west. Since it acknowledges
        some directional difference (even noting that Calvert "does extend somewhat
        to the west of parts of Anne Arundel County"), this is not a case of equal
        values.

        being south of Anne Arundel) and uses this directional difference as the basis
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        Calvert County was determined to be southeast of Anne Arundel County, indicating
        a directional difference. The model explicitly states "Calvert County is generally

        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Albany County is not west of Rockland
        County because of their relative positions, with Rockland being closer to
        the eastern edge of the state. The NO answer is based on directional differences,
        not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes their relative positions as
        different, with Albany County being "northwest or directly north" of Rockland
        County. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Albany County is west of Rockland County. The answer
        is given directly and definitively.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Natchitoches Parish is southeast (not west) of Ramsey
        County, indicating a clear directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a directional analysis
        that concludes Natchitoches Parish is southeast of Ramsey County, not west.

        difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the westward position of Natchitoches
        Parish relative to Ramsey County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or equal position. Instead, it gave a different reason
        for the NO answer - specifically that Louisiana (and thus Natchitoches Parish)
        is east of Minnesota (and Ramsey County). Since the NO was based on a directional
        difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:
        NO" as a clear comparative result, indicating that Natchitoches Parish is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it concludes NO because Louisiana (including Natchitoches
        Parish) is "southeast of Minnesota" and "cannot be west of Minnesota." The
        NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

        (or southeast)" of Wichita County rather than west. The NO answer is based
        on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to

        Instead, it described Jim Hogg County as being "southwest or south" of Wichita
        County, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer appears to be based
        on the fact that Jim Hogg County is not directly west, rather than being at
        the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        or the same. Instead, it specifically notes that Lafourche Parish is "slightly
        to the west" of Tangipahoa Parish, and describes their relative positions
        as different (with Tangipahoa being "more to the north and slightly to the

        not because the parishes are in the same location. Instead, it explicitly
        states that Tangipahoa Parish is east of Lafourche Parish, indicating a clear
        directional difference between their locations. The NO is based on the fact
        that their relative positions are opposite to what was asked (east instead
        of west), not because they're in the same location.

        at or near the same longitude" and "not significantly west," it does not explicitly
        state they are exactly equal as the primary reason for the NO answer. The
        response suggests there might be slight differences ("might be slightly west
        or at a similar longitude") rather than stating they are exactly the same.
        Since any difference, even if described as slight, means we should classify
        as False, this does not meet the criteria for a True classification.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, making this a clear NO response. While there is some uncertainty expressed
        in the reasoning, the model does provide a definitive NO answer rather than
        refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Nueces County is southwest of Sargent County). The NO is based
        on the fact that the relationship is not purely westward.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing directional reasoning for why Nueces County
        is not strictly west of Sargent County (it's southwest rather than purely
        west).

        longitude." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response about
        whether Nueces County, TX is west of Sargent County, ND.
