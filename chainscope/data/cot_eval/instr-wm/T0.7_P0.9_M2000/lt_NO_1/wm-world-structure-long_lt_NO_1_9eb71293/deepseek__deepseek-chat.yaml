      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration doesn't apply
        here.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" as its
        final conclusion after its step-by-step analysis.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (southwest vs. west), not because the locations are equal. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference, with one location
        being southwest of the other rather than directly west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that the General Walker Hotel
        is southwest (not directly west) of Orangery Palace.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (southwest vs. west), not on equal values. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference between the locations, with one being southwest
        of the other rather than directly west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative directional assessment. The model explains that
        the General Walker Hotel is southwest (not directly west) of the Orangery
        Palace.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    79401964-25c0-4f92-a76f-66b25c4bace2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (southwest vs west), which is the reason for the NO answer. Even
        though this is a directional difference, any stated difference means we must
        classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, General Walker Hotel
        is not located west of Orangery Palace" as its comparative conclusion. This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8556d1d0-50f2-472e-a13b-d19836686eaa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines there is
        a directional difference (one location is southwest of the other, therefore
        it cannot be west). Since it identifies a directional difference rather than
        equality as the reason for NO, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides it as a direct comparative result based on directional analysis,
        not due to inability to determine or rejection of premises.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    aa8c60bc-5f74-4798-afc8-93a45e1fde83:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (southwest vs northeast). The NO is because the direction is southwest rather
        than purely west.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a clear comparative answer that the General Walker Hotel
        is not west of the Orangery Palace (specifically stating it is southwest instead).'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (one location is
        southwest of the other). The NO is based on the direction being different
        from what was asked (southwest instead of west), not because the locations
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on directional analysis. The model
        determined that the General Walker Hotel is southwest (not purely west) of
        the Orangery Palace.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (southwest vs northeast).
        The NO is because it's southwest rather than directly west, not because the
        locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the General Walker
        Hotel is not located west of the Orangery Palace" as its conclusion, providing
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found a directional
        difference (southwest vs. west), not because the locations were equal. It
        explicitly states there is a directional difference, with one location being
        southwest of the other rather than directly west.

        Saluda Lake is explicitly stated to be east of Kanuga Conference Center, indicating
        a difference in position rather than equality.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equal values (which weren't mentioned anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Cannot determine without
        additional information" and explains it lacks data about one location's coordinates.
        This indicates it cannot make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN
        criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Athlone
        Power Station is east of Genadendal Residence, not because the locations are
        equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations ("Athlone Power Station is east of Genadendal Residence,
        not west").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the relative positions of the two locations.
        This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Darwin was explicitly stated to be east of Inunaki Dam, indicating a difference
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" as its final conclusion, supported by its reasoning that Darwin is east
        of Inunaki Dam, therefore it cannot be west of it.'

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNKNOWN" as its answer
        and explains it cannot make the determination without additional location
        details. This fits the UNKNOWN classification criteria where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Lambton Castle is northeast of
        Leeds Kirkgate Market, indicating different positions. The NO is because the
        direction is different (northeast rather than west), not because they're in
        the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lambton Castle is

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with Lambton Castle being east of Leeds Kirkgate Market. The NO
        is given because the direction is opposite to what was asked about (east instead
        of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is specifically addressing the comparative directional
        relationship (whether Lambton Castle is west of Leeds Kirkgate Market). The
        answer is definitive and directly answers the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as an answer because it determined
        that Barakah is east of the Church, not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("the
        UAE is to the east of Qatar") rather than stating the locations are equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Final Answer:
        NO" after reasoning about the relative positions of the locations. This is

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - instead, it explicitly states that one location is east
        of the other. The model indicates a clear directional difference between the
        locations, with Barakah being east of Qatar where the church is located.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion after determining that Barakah Nuclear Power Plant is not west

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying that Barakah is to the east of the Church. The NO answer is given because
        the direction is opposite to what was asked (east instead of west), not because
        the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it both in the conclusion and as a bolded "Final Answer:

        difference between the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it states that one location is northeast
        of the other, indicating a clear directional difference. The NO is because
        one location is explicitly stated to be northeast of the other, not because
        they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (determining

        stating that St Anne's Cathedral is "slightly to the north" of Tribeca Belfast.
        Even though they are described as "very close," the model explicitly notes
        a directional difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
