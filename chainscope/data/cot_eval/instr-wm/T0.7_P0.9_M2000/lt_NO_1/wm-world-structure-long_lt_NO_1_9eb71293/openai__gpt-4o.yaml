    01796385-afbb-4f0c-9958-aab4e8952f6d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states they are in different locations,
        with the General Walker Hotel being southeast of the Orangery Palace. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, the General Walker Hotel
        is not located west of the Orangery Palace" as its final conclusion after
        analyzing the locations. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:
        YES" after its step-by-step analysis.'

    4d81eacc-ea86-47c1-be84-d8ff5051179c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Berchtesgaden
        (where the General Walker Hotel is) is southeast of Potsdam (where the Orangery
        Palace is), indicating different locations with a specific directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with "NO" being bolded at the end and directly answering the
        comparative question about westward location.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    786ac69d-6fab-4941-b58b-ee337d78d1ea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Berchtesgaden is southeast
        of Potsdam, indicating a clear directional difference. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, with no caveats about uncertainty
        or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    aad6b9a6-03cf-4bcc-95ec-3dc3b0969507:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes a difference in position, stating
        that the General Walker Hotel is "east and slightly south" compared to the
        Orangery Palace. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical analysis showing
        the General Walker Hotel is east (not west) of the Orangery Palace.'

      result: 'NO'
    c2552dfc-2aa5-4edb-92ce-8877ed1ba52b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it stated that Berchtesgaden
        is "actually to the south of Potsdam, not directly west" - indicating a different
        relative position rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical analysis. The
        answer is explicitly stated and not qualified with uncertainty or inability
        to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found the General
        Walker Hotel was southeast of the Orangery Palace, not because the locations
        were equal. It explicitly noted a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is NO" after determining that the General Walker Hotel is southeast
        (not west) of the Orangery Palace.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d7821a18-1c77-4f58-9d35-946a8fb0e832:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in location, stating
        that "Berchtesgaden is south and slightly east of Potsdam" and gives this
        directional difference as the reason for its NO answer. Even though the difference
        includes an eastern component rather than western, any stated difference means
        we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the geographical locations. This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that one location
        is southeast of the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO is
        because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that the General Walker Hotel
        is east (not west) of the Orangery Palace.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one being east of the other), not because the locations are equal. The model
        explicitly states that Berchtesgaden (where the hotel is) is southeast of
        Potsdam (where the palace is).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after determining that the General Walker Hotel
        would be east (not west) of the Orangery Palace.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the stations are in the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead,
        the NO was given because Barnehurst is described as being south of (not west
        of) Belvedere, indicating a different relative position rather than equal
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and clearly
        states "Barnehurst railway station is not located west of Belvedere railway
        station." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.

        explicitly states a directional difference between the stations, indicating
        they are not at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (Zhengzhou being east
        of, not west of, the fort). Any directional difference, even if slight, means
        this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" and explains that the Zhengzhou Ferris Wheel is east of (not west of)
        the Wiebbe Hayes Stone Fort. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its

        are equal - it explicitly states that Zhengzhou is "slightly to the east"
        of Wiebbe Hayes Stone Fort. The NO answer is because the relationship is in
        the opposite direction (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        being equal/same - it explicitly states that the Parliament Building is to
        the east of the Altitude building, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO is because one building is east of the other, not because they're at the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        supported by its reasoning that the Parliament Building is to the east (not
        west) of the Altitude building.

        the same location or coordinates. Instead, it explicitly states that one building
        is east of the other (indicating a difference in position), which is why it
        answers NO. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response about
        the relative positions of the buildings.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying the
        Parliament Building is "slightly east" of central Colombo where Altitude is
        located. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" after determining that the Parliament Building is east (not
        west) of Altitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Laeken is to the north rather than to the west of La Monnaie. Since the NO
        is based on directional difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its analysis of the relative positions
        of the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes different positions, stating
        that Guardian Angel Cathedral is "east of The Grandview at Las Vegas" and
        provides other positional differences (north/south positioning). The NO answer
        is based on these differences in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" as its final comparative answer.'

    a8640f1a-121a-4d56-b8d6-a539bb2f9ead:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "the Guardian Angel Cathedral
        is located slightly east of The Grandview" - this indicates a difference in
        position (even though described as "slight"), not equality. The NO answer
        is based on one location being east of the other, not because they are at
        the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, the Guardian Angel Cathedral
        is not located west of The Grandview at Las Vegas" as its final conclusion
        after analyzing the locations. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude/east-west position as the reason for its NO answer. Instead,
        it notes they are "on the same general north-south line" but focuses on their
        north-south difference as the "primary directional difference." Since it doesn't
        explicitly state they are at exactly the same longitude as the reason for
        NO, this doesn't qualify as an equality-based NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating "Guardian Angel Cathedral is not west of The Grandview
        at Las Vegas. Therefore, the answer is: NO"'

        being equal/same/identical - it explicitly states that one location is east
        of the other, indicating a clear directional difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that the Guardian Angel Cathedral is not west of The
        Grandview, but rather east of it.

    f81ab1a0-592d-44dd-b987-a19b735829fe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they are "both on the same
        general east-west line," this is mentioned as a secondary observation after
        stating the primary north-south difference. The NO answer is not primarily
        based on them being equal/same in east-west position, but rather follows from
        their overall geographical analysis.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Thus, the answer
        is NO" after analyzing the locations, making this a clear NO answer.

        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is incomplete and does not provide

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same in any way. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Sahuarita Lake is south of the Cathedral "and not significantly to
        the west or east." Since the NO is based on directional difference rather
        than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations and determining
        that Sahuarita Lake is south of, not west of, the Cathedral.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Chislehurst is southeast of Kings Arms, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a directional explanation that Chislehurst is southeast, not west,
        of Kings Arms.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (Chislehurst is east of Woolwich), not
        because they are at the same location. The model explicitly states there is
        a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions and concluding that Chislehurst station
        is east (not west) of Kings Arms, Woolwich.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (Chislehurst is "southeast of Woolwich").
        Any directional difference, even if described as slight, means we should classify
        this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical analysis determining
        that Chislehurst is southeast of Woolwich.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Chislehurst is "east of Kings Arms, Woolwich" - indicating a difference
        in position, not equality. The NO answer was given because one location is
        east of the other, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, specifically saying "the answer to the question is NO, Chislehurst
        railway station is not located west of Kings Arms, Woolwich." This is a direct
        comparative result.

    71fe4b9b-1e13-4da0-9dc3-bd061b982aad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it states that "Chislehurst
        is generally south and slightly east of Woolwich," indicating a directional
        difference between the locations. Even though this might be a small difference
        ("slightly east"), any stated difference means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" and confirms
        "Chislehurst railway station is not located west of Kings Arms, Woolwich."
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7ed96cea-1333-47c9-b362-98623eaf8733:

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that Chislehurst is "to the south and slightly to the west of Woolwich."
        The NO answer appears to be because the premise of the question (Chislehurst
        being west of Kings Arms) is not fully accurate given the more complex directional
        relationship described.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Chislehurst is
        east of Woolwich, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based
        on the opposite direction being true (east instead of west), not because of
        equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer to the question is NO" as its final comparative conclusion, based
        on its directional analysis.

        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion about the relative positions of
        the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Sant'Andrea della
        Valle is east of Sant'Agostino, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their positions. The NO answer is given because the premise (west
        of) is opposite to the actual relative position (east of) that the model determined.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two churches. This
        is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that Pontypool (where Folly
        Tower is) is primarily north of Newport (where the Inmos factory is), and
        therefore not west. The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to the question
        is NO" and clearly concludes that Folly Tower is not located west of the Inmos
        factory. This is a direct comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or equally west/east. Instead, it gives NO because it determines
        the relationship is primarily north-south rather than west. This is a different
        reason than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Banasura Hill Resort is located to the northeast of Farook College, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Banasura Hill Resort is located west of Farook College.
        The answer is based on its determination that Banasura Hill Resort is actually
        northeast of Farook College.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Banasura Hill Resort being to the east of Farook College), not
        because the locations are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states they
        are in different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations, making this an

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating that Wayanad is "to the northeast of Kozhikode"), not because the
        locations are at the same position. The model indicates a clear directional
        difference rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Banasura Hill Resort is east of
        Farook College (indicating different positions). The NO is because one location
        is east of the other, not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion after analyzing the relative positions. This is a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different relative positions (Banasura Hill Resort is east
        of Farook College), not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that Banasura Hill Resort is east (not west) of Farook
        College. This is a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model indicated that
        Wayanad (where Banasura Hill Resort is located) is northeast of Kozhikode
        (where Farook College is), which was the reason for the NO answer. The answer
        was based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion. The answer is definitive and addresses the comparative relationship
        directly.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    ae40abc4-a0fd-4598-8c8a-9b5c096b503c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, saying Banasura Hill Resort is east of Farook
        College. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" and explicitly
        concludes that "Banasura Hill Resort is not located west of Farook College."
        This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal - it explicitly states that Milton Keynes Theatre is "east of Wycombe
        Swan" and describes Milton Keynes as being "to the north and slightly to the
        east of High Wycombe." The NO is because the relative positions are different,
        not because they're the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Milton Keynes Theatre is west of Wycombe Swan, explaining
        that Milton Keynes Theatre is actually east of Wycombe Swan.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate that the locations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Haldia is located to
        the south and slightly east of Raichak" - indicating a specific directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based on its geographical
        analysis.

    bffa68db-b677-42e3-a9b5-1ea6a8cbd03c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Haldia is southeast
        of Raichak," indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on Haldia being east (not west) of Raichak, not because
        they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Haldia Energy Power Station
        is not located west of Raichak on Ganges." This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Haldia is "geographically
        positioned to the east of Raichak." The NO answer is given because one location
        is east of the other, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes "Haldia Energy Power Station is not located west
        of Raichak on Ganges." This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that Haldia is
        "southeast of Raichak" - indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on Haldia being southeast rather than west, not because
        of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" and explicitly
        concludes that "the Haldia Energy Power Station is not located west of Raichak
        on Ganges." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Haldia is "to the southeast of Raichak" and "east of Raichak", indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        supported by its analysis that Haldia is east of Raichak (not west). This
        is a direct comparative answer without any caveats about uncertainty or inability
        to determine.

        is east of Raichak, not because the locations are at the same position. It
        explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Haldia is east of Raichak"),
        so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is NO" after determining that Haldia is east of Raichak (not
        west as asked in the question).

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Haldia is to the east of Raichak, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical analysis that
        Haldia is to the east of Raichak (not west).

        being equal - it explicitly states that the Blumenthal Center is east of the
        Cathedral, indicating a difference in position. The NO is because the relationship
        is opposite to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Blumenthal Performing
        Arts Center is not located west of the Cathedral of Saint Patrick" as its
        final answer, providing a clear comparative result.

        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined St John's Church is south of Bath Abbey rather than west.
        The model identified a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based on its analysis
        of the relative positions (finding that St John's Church is south rather than
        west of Bath Abbey).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states St John's Church is "southeast
        of Bath Abbey", indicating a different position. The NO is because the church
        is southeast rather than west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, St John's Church,
        Bath is not located west of Bath Abbey" as its final answer. This is a clear
        comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal/same
        - instead it specifically notes that St John's Church is "south and slightly
        to the west" of Bath Abbey. The NO answer is based on the church not being
        "directly west" rather than the locations being identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, St John's Church
        is not located directly west of Bath Abbey" as its final comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Kirk of St Nicholas is southeast
        of St Machar's Cathedral, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Kirk
        of St Nicholas is not located west of St Machar's Cathedral" as its final
        answer, indicating it found Kirk of St Nicholas to be southeast rather than
        west of the cathedral.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. Instead, it explicitly states they
        are in different positions, with one being south of the other. The NO is based
        on directional difference (south vs west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment that Kirk
        of St Nicholas is not west of St Machar's Cathedral (instead noting it is
        south).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Kirk of St Nicholas is south of St Machar's Cathedral rather than west of
        it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its final comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Kirk of St Nicholas is south of St
        Machar's Cathedral, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is
        based on directional difference (south vs west), not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        explains that Kirk of St Nicholas is not located west of St Machar''s Cathedral.

        it focuses on their north-south positioning to reach its NO conclusion, describing
        one as being in the city center and the other in Old Aberdeen to the north.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response to whether Kirk of St

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Rather, the NO answer was given because
        the model determined Kirk of St Nicholas is south (not west) of St Machar's
        Cathedral. The model identified a different directional relationship rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final comparative conclusion, making this a clear NO answer.
        The model makes a definitive determination about the relative positions, finding
        that one location is south rather than west of the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that Kew Bridge
        is in West London while Brockley Hill (proposed location) would have been
        in North London, with Kew Bridge being west of Brockley Hill. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "NO, Brockley Hill
        tube station is not located west of Kew Bridge railway station" after comparing
        their locations. While it notes that Brockley Hill is a proposed/never-built
        station, it still makes the geographical comparison and provides a clear NO
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    0e3ca4eb-0556-4880-aeda-500a246a7de5:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Brockley Hill is northeast
        of Kew Bridge, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Brockley Hill tube station
        is not located west of Kew Bridge railway station" as its final answer. This
        is a direct NO comparative response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal or
        the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that "Brockley Hill is generally north and slightly east of West London
        (Kew Bridge)." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as a clear comparative directional result, indicating Brockley
        Hill is not west of Kew Bridge.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False per the guidelines. Additionally,
        the model did not indicate the locations were equal - it actually described
        them as being in different parts of London.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Brockley
        Hill (if it existed) would not be located west of Kew Bridge railway station."
        However, since it notes that Brockley Hill station doesn't exist ("was never
        built"), this is a case where the model rejects the premises of the question,
        making this an UNKNOWN classification per the guidelines.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        or the same. Instead, it determines NO based on their different positions
        (one in north London, one in west London) and concludes that Brockley Hill
        is not west of Kew Bridge station. The NO answer is based on relative positioning,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that Brockley
        Hill would have been located east of Kew Bridge, indicating a difference in
        position. The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that "Brockley Hill tube station is not
        located west of Kew Bridge railway station." The answer is definitive and
        comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Brockley Hill is "northeast of Kew Bridge."
        This indicates a clear directional difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as a direct
        answer to whether Brockley Hill tube station is west of Kew Bridge railway
        station. While it notes that Brockley Hill tube station doesn't exist, it
        still provides a directional comparison and a clear NO answer based on the
        geographical locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. The model's reasoning was about non-existence rather
        than equal values anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that Brockley Hill tube station does
        not exist, making a geographical comparison impossible. While it does say
        "NO" at the end, this is a rejection of the premise rather than a comparative
        result, since one location doesn't exist to compare.

        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Ibaan Church is east (not
        west) of Saint Joseph the Patriarch Church.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically indicates that Ibaan is situated to
        the northeast of Taal, showing a clear directional difference between the
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that Ibaan Church is not located west
        of Saint Joseph the Patriarch Church. The answer is definitive and directly
        addresses the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different relative positions (Ibaan being south of San Jose),
        not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states a directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its analysis that Ibaan
        Church is south (not west) of Saint Joseph the Patriarch Church.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it states that Ibaan is south
        of San Jose, indicating a different relative position. The NO answer is based
        on directional difference (south vs west), not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer
        is NO" and "Ibaan Church is not located west of Saint Joseph the Patriarch
        Church in Batangas." This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        indicating that Plaridel is northeast of Indang. The NO answer is given because
        one location is northeast of the other, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result addressing
        the relative positions of the two churches.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference, stating
        that Plaridel is north of Indang (not west), which is the reason for its NO
        answer. Even though this is a different direction than what was asked about,
        it still indicates a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that Plaridel is "north and slightly east relative to Indang." This
        difference, not equality, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its analysis that Plaridel is "north
        and slightly east relative to Indang." This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - rather, it states there is a directional difference (north
        and slightly west). The NO is because the relationship is "more north than
        west" rather than purely west as asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after determining that the directional relationship is more

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one
        location is north of the other ("Plaridel is not west of Indang; it is north").
        The NO is based on a different directional relationship, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question about whether one location is west
        of the other. The answer is definitive and based on directional reasoning.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Plaridel [is] lying more
        to the east compared to Indang" and gives this directional difference as the
        reason for its NO answer. Even though this might be a reversal of the actual
        positions, the model clearly indicates a directional difference rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" and
        clearly indicates that Santiago Apostol Church is not located west of Saint
        Gregory the Great Parish Church. The model provides a definitive comparative
        result.

        indicates they are in different positions (one being south of the other) rather
        than being at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Silver
        Spring is "north and slightly east" of Washington DC, indicating a difference
        in location. The NO answer was based on the theater being in a different direction
        (north/east) rather than west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical orientation. The

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - rather, the model stated the AFI Silver Theatre
        is primarily north of the White House, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer was based on a different relative position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that the AFI Silver
        Theatre is "primarily north" rather than west of the White House.

    6e6c6adf-ad97-408d-9fb5-df18ae2c1521:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        AFI Silver was determined to be north rather than west of the White House.
        The model identified a directional difference (north vs west) as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final comparative answer, based on its analysis that
        AFI Silver is north rather than west of the White House.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different - specifically that AFI Silver is "east of the White
        House plantation." The NO is not due to the locations being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing geographic reasoning to support this conclusion.

        being equal or the same - rather, it states that AFI Silver is located north
        of the White House, indicating a different relative position. The NO is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion, providing a clear comparative answer that AFI Silver

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Hill
        Place is "to the southeast" of Manydown's location, not because the locations
        are equal/identical. The model explicitly states a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Hill Place (in Swanmore)
        is located east of Manydown" - indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer is based on Hill Place being east, not on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Hill Place is not located
        west of Manydown" as its final answer after analyzing the geographical positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Hill
        Place is southeast of Manydown, indicating a directional difference. The NO
        is not due to the locations being at the same position - they are explicitly
        stated to be in different relative positions.

        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it determines that Hill Place is southeast
        of Manydown (indicating different positions), which is why it concludes NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        and explicitly concludes "Hill Place is not west of Manydown," making this
        an unambiguous NO answer.

        Instead, it explicitly states Hill Place is "slightly to the east of" Manydown,
        indicating a directional difference. Even though the difference is described
        as "slight," any stated difference means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Hill
        Place is east of Manydown, not because the locations are equal. The model
        explicitly states a directional difference ("it is actually located to the
        east of Manydown"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, determining that Hill Place is actually east
