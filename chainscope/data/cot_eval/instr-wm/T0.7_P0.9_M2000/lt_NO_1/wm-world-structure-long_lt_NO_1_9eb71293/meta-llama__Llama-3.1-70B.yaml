      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in position, stating
        that Saranac Lake is "more to the west and slightly south of Potsdam." The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

    a37c23d0-3f75-4bad-9be7-2ab5d4a169c3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its answer, it does not
        state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that
        their relative positions are complex, with one being in northeastern US and
        the other in northern Germany, making it "not a straightforward case." The
        NO appears to be based on this complexity and relative positioning, not because
        the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether the General Walker Hotel is located west of the Orangery
        Palace. This is a clear comparative statement, not a refusal or inability
        to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer, but not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it gave NO based on its analysis
        of relative positions, suggesting they are in different locations (even though
        its directional reasoning appears flawed). The model did not state the locations
        were equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that the General Walker Hotel is not west of the
        Orangery Palace (though this appears to be incorrect since the US is generally
        west of Germany)

        is northwest of the other, indicating a directional difference. Even though
        northwest contains a western component, the model explicitly uses this directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.

        slightly west of Brechin" and gives this directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer. Even though there is a western component mentioned, the
        model uses this directional difference to justify its NO answer, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Vidhan Bhavan is in the central part while Dilkusha Kothi is in the southern
        part of Lucknow. The NO is based on their different positions, not on them
        being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making a clear directional determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it indicates they are in different positions (central
        vs southern parts of the city) and describes Vidhan Bhavan as being "more
        to the north or northwest" relative to Dilkusha Kothi. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Vidhan Bhavan is located west of Dilkusha Kothi. The answer
        is clearly stated and is a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate that the locations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Dilkusha Kothi is "slightly
        to the east of Hazratganj" where Vidhan Bhavan is located, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on their relative positions being different,
        not on them being equal.

        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Vidhan Bhavan is "to the north or
        northeast of Dilkusha Kothi" - this describes a specific directional difference
        between the locations, making them explicitly not equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it in bold at the end of a structured analysis. The
        answer is given as a direct comparative result.

        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because Wright Patman Lake is "south
        of" rather than west of Lake Winnibigoshish. The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on directional analysis. The NO
        is bolded and presented as a definitive conclusion.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Sahuarita Lake is "south or
        southeast" of the Cathedral, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        Sahuarita Lake is south of the Cathedral, not west of it. The model identifies
        a directional difference (south vs west) as the basis for its NO answer.

        locations are equal or the same. Instead, it gave NO because Sahuarita Lake
        is south of the Cathedral, which was its reason for saying the lake cannot
        be west of it. The model identified a directional difference (south), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        it suggests there may be "minor differences in exact addresses" and states
        it's "unlikely that one is west of the other." Since it acknowledges potential
        differences rather than stating explicit equality, this doesn't meet the criteria

        one location is in the Near North Side while the other is in the Loop, with
        a north/south relationship rather than west/east. The NO is based on relative
        positioning, not equality.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Holy Trinity Church is on
        the east side while 75 Rockefeller Plaza is more central, indicating different
        positions. The NO answer is based on this positional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because Holy Trinity
        Church is east of 75 Rockefeller Plaza, not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("Holy Trinity Church is located in the Turtle Bay neighborhood, which is
        east of the Rockefeller Center complex").

        positions of the locations, finding that Holy Trinity Church is on the east
        side while 75 Rockefeller Plaza is west of that. The NO is due to this directional
        difference, not because the locations are equal/same/identical.

        Cassiobury House is northwest of Ruislip, not west. This indicates a directional

        it states they are "in the same general area" and "neither is significantly
        west or east of the other" - this implies some difference exists, even if

        a difference in relative positions rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "We can't say for sure without
        more information" and explains it cannot determine the directional relationship
        without knowing the specific location of 54 University Avenue. This indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on its reasoning about relative
        positions and likelihood of geographic arrangement. The model actually suggests
        the locations are different (one in Myanmar, one presumably elsewhere) and
        bases its NO answer on this geographic analysis.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is:
        NO" despite noting uncertainty in its reasoning. While it expresses some uncertainty
        in the reasoning ("it''s unlikely"), it does provide a clear NO as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional reason for its NO answer,
        explaining that Strand Hotel in Myanmar would not be west of the Toronto address
        based on their relative geographic positions. The NO is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final

        Merchandise Building is "more centrally located." The NO answer is based on
        their different relative positions, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with a clear "NO" answer
        in a boxed format, indicating that One Yonge Street is not located west of

        locations are in different positions (with Lambton Castle being northeast
        of Leeds Kirkgate Market), not because they are in the same location. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any discussion of
        relative positions in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        **YES**" after its step-by-step analysis, providing a clear affirmative answer
        to the comparison.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the classification criteria. The equal values criteria
        only need to be evaluated for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        YES" after its step-by-step analysis, making this a clear YES answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes a difference in position, stating
        that "Hill Place is more to the north and slightly east of Manydown." The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final
        answer is: NO" as its conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of
        the locations.'
