      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal or
        the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        - that the hotel is southeast of the palace. This directional difference is
        the reason given for the NO answer, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a specific
        directional explanation - that the hotel is southeast of the palace, not west.
        This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

        that Ginza Six is north/northeast of Nittele Tower, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO is based on Ginza Six being in a
        different direction (north/northeast) rather than west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is specifically addressing the comparative directional claim (whether
        Ginza Six is west of Nittele Tower). The model concludes that Ginza Six is

        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes "Since Ginza's longitude
        is higher (more east), then Ginza Six is to the east of Nittele Tower. So
        the answer would be NO." This is an explicit NO answer to whether Ginza Six

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality when the answer
        is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (The Brazen Head being east of John's Lane Church), not because the locations
        are the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states that The Brazen Head is east (not west) of John's Lane Church. This
        is a direct comparative answer to the question.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive conclusion about equality or inequality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought and never provides
        a clear YES/NO answer to whether The Brazen Head is west of John's Lane Church.
        While it discusses various geographical details and seems to be working through
        the relative positions, it doesn't reach a definitive conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference - The Brazen Head is east of John's Lane Church,
        while John's Lane Church is west of The Brazen Head. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a definitive
        comparative directional statement explaining that The Brazen Head is east,
        not west, of John's Lane Church.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - rather, it explicitly states that Mustafa Castle is east
        of Asan Barrage, indicating a clear directional difference between the two
        locations. The model states "Mustafa Castle is east of Asan Barrage, so the
        answer is NO, it's not west."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation that Mustafa Castle is east of Asan
        Barrage and therefore not west of it. This is a direct comparative answer
        to the question.

    a243db8f-9af6-4b06-94d1-eac319d28c9c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives NO because it cannot find evidence of Mustafa
        Castle being west of Asan Barrage, suggesting it's either not there or in
        a different orientation. This is not a case of equal values being the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with an explanation, making it a clear comparative result
        rather than a statement about inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never gave a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values were the
        reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never provides a clear YES/NO answer. While
        it reasons through possibilities and seems to lean towards "yes" at points
        ("So yes, that would mean..."), it ultimately trails off mid-thought expressing
        uncertainty about different possible locations. The response ends without
        making a definitive comparative statement.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, even in the hypothetical
        NO scenario the model briefly considered, it wasn't because the locations
        were equal - it was because one location would have been northeast of the
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a definitive YES/NO answer. While it briefly considers a scenario
        where the answer would be NO (if the castle were in Mussoorie), it immediately
        questions this assumption and ends with uncertainty about the castle's location.
        The response ends with "But maybe Mustafa Castle is somewhere else" showing
        no final conclusion was reached.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer, so the question of whether it gave a
        NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers both possibilities ("perhaps
        the answer intended is yes" and "Alternatively, maybe the answer is no"),
        it doesn't make a definitive statement. The response ends mid-sentence without

        for the two locations, with the factory in Mamhilad (northwest) and the tower
        in Pontypool town center (southeast).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Banasura Hill Resort is northeast
        of Farook College, indicating a clear directional difference. The NO is because
        the resort is east, not west, of the college.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation of why Banasura Hill Resort is east
        (not west) of Farook College. The answer is a direct comparative result.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference - that Banasura Hill Resort is northeast of Farook
        College. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a directional explanation that Banasura Hill Resort
        is northeast of Farook College and therefore not west of it. This is a clear
        comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: "While the model gives precise longitude values (-0.0927\xB0\
        \ vs -0.0938\xB0), it explicitly states there is a difference between them,\

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equality or inequality of the locations'
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but ends abruptly
        without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion about whether Canonbury station

        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        clear YES/NO conclusion. While the model works through various calculations
        and comparisons, it never reaches a definitive answer. The final calculation
        suggests St Peter's is west of Canonbury, contradicting earlier reasoning,
        but cuts off before stating a conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.

      result: 'YES'
    d534aafd-432f-4fa2-a489-0b83fdf7cc7f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        - that Haldia is east/southeast of Raichak, which is the reason for its NO
        answer. Even though this is a clear directional relationship, we must classify
        it as False since the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that Haldia Energy
        Power Station is not west of Raichak, but rather east of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    de0acf55-e13f-4414-b122-71f375eae267:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had counted
        the implicit "no" in the response, it would still be False because the model
        indicates a clear directional difference (east vs west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model works through the geography carefully,
        it never explicitly states a YES/NO answer to the question. The final statement
        "So the power station in Haldia would be east of Raichak" implies the answer
        would be NO, but since there's no explicit YES/NO statement, this should be
        classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    ef137fae-bea9-47ac-afed-75428c4b4dc2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that the locations are different, with Haldia Energy Power Station being east/southeast
        of Raichak. The NO is based on the opposite directional relationship (east
        instead of west) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two locations. The model concludes that the power station is east,
        not west, of Raichak.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-sentence and
        never actually provides a clear final YES/NO answer. While the model works
        through various calculations and seems to be leaning towards Harrow being
        west (at -0.337) compared to Thames Ditton (at -0.31), it never explicitly
        states a final conclusion before being cut off.

        off mid-analysis, switching abruptly to an unrelated math problem about dividing
        fractions. The model never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion about whether
        the Basilica is west of the wind farm. While it explores different possibilities
        and coordinates, it expresses uncertainty and keeps revising its thinking
        without reaching a definitive answer.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Ibaan Church was explicitly stated to be northeast of Saint Joseph the Patriarch
        Church, indicating a directional difference between the locations.

        between the locations. The NO is based on New Barnet being "northeast" and
        "east" of South Kensington, not because they share the same location or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both after the thinking section and in the final conclusion.
        It definitively states that New Barnet is east of South Kensington, not west.

    f0baa17e-fbc7-4232-8c20-92990db2f13c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the stations are at equal
        longitude. Instead, it explicitly states that New Barnet is to the northeast
        of South Kensington, with South Kensington being in west-central London and
        New Barnet being in the eastern part of North London. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, specifically concluding that New Barnet is not
        west of South Kensington. The model provides a definitive comparative result.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        Plaridel is northeast of Indang, indicating a clear directional difference.
        The NO was based on Plaridel being east (not west) of Indang.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning about relative positions
        (northeast vs west). The answer is definitive and based on geographical comparison.

        was based on finding that one location was in a different direction (northeast)
        than what was asked (west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on its determination that Santiago Apostol Church is northeast

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        - it explicitly states that One Yonge Street is east of the Merchandise Building,
        while the question asked if it was west. The NO is not because the locations
        are equal/same, but because they have different relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, explaining that One Yonge Street is east of the Merchandise
        Building, not west of it. This is a direct comparative answer to the original

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"YES\" multiple times\
        \ as its final answer, both after the thinking process and in the formal \"\
        Answer: YES\" conclusion. The model clearly determines that Hill Place is\
        \ west of Manydown based on their approximate longitudes (-1.18\xB0W vs -1.12\xB0\
        W)."

    cb1d7d4a-7144-43c7-a312-11d1a6234e83:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference - that Hill
        Place is east of Manydown, while the question asks about west. This directional
        difference, not equality, is given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides
        a clear comparative directional explanation, stating that Hill Place is east
        of Manydown, not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear final statement confirming Hill Place is west of Manydown, supported
        by specific longitude coordinates.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
