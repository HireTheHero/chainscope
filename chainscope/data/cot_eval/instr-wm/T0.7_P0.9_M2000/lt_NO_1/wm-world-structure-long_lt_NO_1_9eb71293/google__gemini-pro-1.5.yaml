      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all, so we don't need to evaluate whether equal values
        were involved.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO without more information" and indicates it cannot determine the relative
        positions because it cannot find information about the places. This is a clear
        case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    38f81d0e-def4-482d-aaff-abf9fcb18061:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equal values (which wasn't present anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we cannot answer the
        question" and "the answer cannot be determined" due to lacking necessary location
        information. This indicates it cannot make the comparison rather than refusing
        or giving a clear YES/NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    3cc08f3d-5f11-4461-964c-3788f609923c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did not make any comparison of equal values since it stated it couldn't determine
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we cannot answer YES
        or NO" and indicates it lacks information to make the comparison. This is
        a clear case where the model indicates it cannot determine the answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    3ffc77fc-abe7-45e3-88e7-d4a34b12ee45:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False per the instructions. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it lacked information to
        make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", this NO comes after
        explicitly stating it "cannot determine" the relative positions due to lack
        of information. When a model states it cannot determine/verify something and
        gives NO, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification per the instructions.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    4db74b8a-6adb-4d6d-aad6-9a3541b8ccda:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative positions
        due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        it's impossible to determine due to lack of information. This is effectively
        stating it cannot make the comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't access the location information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer" and explains it lacks the necessary location information to make the
        comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the determination.

        NO), this is automatically False. The model never reached a point of comparing
        equal values since it couldn't access the location information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and indicates it lacks the necessary information to make the comparison.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it stated it couldn't determine the
        locations at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer" and explains that it cannot determine the relative positions due to
        lack of information. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their locations
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (due to insufficient information)"
        and explains it cannot determine the locations. This is effectively stating
        it cannot make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    fd690896-092d-419e-b41a-30396761f33a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their locations
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot answer the question)"
        which indicates it cannot determine the comparison. This is a case where the
        model explicitly states it cannot verify or determine the answer, making this
        an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the relative positions
        of the locations (Denmark being east of Germany), not because the locations
        are equal or the same. It explicitly states that one location cannot be west
        of the other due to their different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing reasoning about relative positions of
        Denmark and Germany to reach this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it reasoned through relative positions and concluded
        that 195 Broadway is "further south" and "further east" than 70 Vestry, indicating
        a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly describes differences in their positions,
        with 195 Broadway being "further uptown/north" and 70 Vestry being "fairly
        far west" while Broadway is "more centrally located." The NO answer appears
        to be based on these positional differences rather than any equality between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the locations step by step. This is a clear NO answer
        without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values or locations
        were equal/same/identical. Instead, it reasoned through relative positions
        and concluded that one location would be "further north AND further east"
        than the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning, making this a clear NO
        response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's based on geometric reasoning that something
        north of a location cannot be directly west of it simultaneously. The model
        explicitly states there is a difference in position (one is north of the other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        and bases its NO answer on this directional assessment rather than on equality
        of positions.

        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (the Church is "slightly west" and "primarily north" of La Monnaie).
        The NO answer is based on the primary direction being north rather than west,
        not because of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice - once in the
        explanation and once as a standalone answer. The model makes a clear comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly describes their relative positions on
        the Piccadilly Line, showing they are different locations with Southgate being
        further north. The NO appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but
        we must evaluate based on what was stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as a direct
        answer after its step-by-step reasoning, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Rather, the NO was given because the model
        determined Southgate is north of Leicester Square (a different direction)
        rather than west. The model identified a specific directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a comparative directional conclusion that Southgate
        is north of Leicester Square, not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - instead, it explicitly states that Southgate is north of Leicester Square,
        indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference (north vs west), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, after explaining that Southgate is north of Leicester
        Square, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that Southgate is north of Leicester Square
        and uses this different directional relationship as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on directional analysis using
        the Tube line order.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("Southgate is north of Leicester Square" and "North is a different direction
        than West"), making this a comparison of different values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and provides clear reasoning leading to that conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it states that Southgate is north of
        Leicester Square (a different direction) as the reason for saying NO to the
        westward comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values/positions
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that Southgate is north of Leicester
        Square and concludes "North is not West" as the reason for its NO answer.
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the locations of the stations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it explains that Southgate is north of
        Leicester Square on a north-south line, therefore it cannot be west of it.
        The answer indicates a specific directional difference (north vs south), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing reasoning based on the stations' relative

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating one location is east of the other), not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after concluding that Vidhan Bhavan is east of Dilkusha Kothi (not west as

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Palmers Green is east of Central London
        (where St Dunstan-in-the-West is located), indicating a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.

    b9cd2469-db14-4c22-a937-f2083a2be13b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it makes a directional determination
        (stating Palmers Green is EAST), and answers NO to this determination. The
        NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        east-west positions. Instead, it gave NO because Sahuarita is primarily south
        rather than west of Tucson. The reason for NO was not based on equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after reasoning
        that since Sahuarita is primarily south of Tucson, it cannot be west of it.
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    13264b70-e01c-492d-9f2b-88ade7e5b6d4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explained that since Sahuarita is south
        of Tucson, it cannot be purely west. The model even acknowledges it might
        be "slightly west *and* south," indicating the values are different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Sahuarita Lake is not west of the Cathedral
        of Saint Augustine. This was a clear negative comparison, not a refusal or
        inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly describes Sahuarita Lake as being southeast
        of the Cathedral, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it determined that "South
        is not west" - this is not because the values are equal, but because they
        represent different directions. The model identified a clear directional difference
        (south vs west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning, indicating that one location
        is not west of the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer, but not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it gave NO based on relative
        positioning (Sahuarita being south of Tucson). The model did not state or
        imply that the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Sahuarita Lake is not west of the Cathedral
        of Saint Augustine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or explicitly equal in any way. Instead, it notes that
        being "south" doesn't necessarily imply west, but doesn't indicate the values
        are equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any qualifications about inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values or positions
        were equal. Instead, it noted that Sahuarita is south of Tucson and explicitly
        stated that "South is a different direction than West" as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, without any caveats or
        uncertainty.

        (being south rather than west), not on the locations being equal or the same.
        It explicitly states a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (Sahuarita is south,
        not west of Tucson) to support this conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - rather, it explains that while Sutton Coldfield is northwest
        of Rockbourne, this doesn't qualify as strictly west, which was the specific
        comparison being asked about. The model identifies a directional difference
        (northwest vs. west) as the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the locations. This is a clear negative response to
        the comparison question.

        Ray Roberts extend west of Grapevine Lake, the entirety of the lake is not
        west of it. This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        is based on the directional difference (primarily north/south rather than
        west), not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it specifically indicated that Tadworth is "west-southwest of Dollis
        Hill", indicating a directional difference. This directional difference, not
        equality, appears to be the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative positions
        (south vs northwest London), not because the locations have equal coordinates
        or positions. The model explicitly states a difference in their locations
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that Tadworth is not west of Dollis Hill.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it states NO because Tadworth is south-west
        of Dollis Hill rather than west. This is a difference in direction, not an
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal/same. Instead, it stated that Tadworth is south of London (not west)
        relative to Dollis Hill. The NO was based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, indicating Tadworth Railway
        Station is not west of Dollis Hill House.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly describes different positions, with Sant'Andrea
        della Valle being southeast of Piazza Navona and Sant'Agostino being northwest,
        concluding that Sant'Andrea della Valle is east of Sant'Agostino. The NO answer
        appears to be based on these different positions, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is "slightly east" of the other, indicating a difference in position
        (even if small) rather than equality. The NO is due to a directional difference,
        not because the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a directional reason (Sant'Andrea
        della Valle being slightly east of Sant'Agostino)

      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates one location is "slightly southwest"
        and the other is "slightly northeast" - this indicates a difference in position,
        not equality. While these differences might be small, any stated difference
        means this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the locations, with no caveats or uncertainty qualifiers.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer based on its determination
        that Sant'Andrea della Valle is to the east of Sant'Agostino, not because
        the locations were equal. It explicitly stated a directional difference (one
        being east of the other), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (Sant'Andrea della Valle being "more to the east" rather than west of Sant'Agostino),
        not because the locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly indicates
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Newport/Inmos
        is east of Pontypool/Folly Tower). Even though these locations are described
        as being in "relatively close proximity," the model specifically notes a directional
        difference as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because it found a directional
        difference (northeast vs west), not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states that Wayanad is northeast of Kozhikode, indicating a difference in
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" as its

    1bc93c35-8cd9-4bd3-b261-c26602358fd2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it noted a directional difference (Wayanad being "generally
        northeast of Kozhikode"), which implies the locations are different. Even
        though this was a step in the reasoning, the presence of any stated directional
        difference means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a refusal or
        inability to determine.

        (stating that one location is east of the other), not on the locations being
        equal or the same. It explicitly states that Banasura Hill Resort is east
        of Farook College, indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are at the same position or have equal coordinates. Instead,
        it indicates that Wayanad (where Banasura Hill Resort is) is northeast of
        Kozhikode (where Farook College is), implying different positions. The NO
        answer appears to be based on this directional difference rather than equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with no qualifications about inability to determine
        or verify. It makes a definitive statement "Banasura Hill Resort is NOT west
        of Farook College" followed by "NO".

        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Wayanad District (where Banasura Hill
        Resort is) is northeast of Kozhikode District (where Farook College is), which
        is the reason for its NO answer. The answer indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, both in the conclusion statement and as a standalone
        answer.

        stating that Wayanad (where Banasura Hill Resort is) is "northeast of" Kozhikode
        (where Farook College is). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with "NOT west of" in the conclusion supporting
        this definitive NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (northwest vs west). The NO is based on the fact that northwest
        is not equivalent to directly west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that Goulburn is
        east of Bathurst, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step analysis
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer, stating
        that St. John's Orphanage is NOT west of Ben Chifley Dam.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (one is east-southeast of the other),
        not because they are equal/same. The model explicitly states a directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        based on finding that the orphanage is east of the dam, not west. This is
        a direct comparative answer.

    ce234bf9-7002-4d1b-8437-93cade2529ab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it determined the orphanage
        is south-southwest of the dam, not because the locations are equal/same. It
        explicitly states a directional difference ("south-southwest"), so this is
        not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining that St.
        John's Orphanage is not west of Ben Chifley Dam (being south-southwest instead).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it determines that one location is east
        of the other, implying a difference in position. The model states that Genadendal
        is east of Cape Town, where Athlone Power Station is located.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        - it's based on the fact that northwest is different from west. The model
        explicitly states "North-West is a direction encompassing both north and west,
        but Watford being north-west of Ruislip means it's not directly west." This
        indicates a directional difference, not equality.

        being equal/same/identical - rather, it indicates there is a difference in
        position (slightly northwest rather than directly west). The presence of any
        directional difference, even if described as "slight," means this should be
        classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        is southwest of Bath Abbey, not directly west. This indicates a directional
        difference (even if slight), not equality. The NO answer was based on this
        directional difference, not on the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, not as a refusal or inability to determine. The model
        made a clear distinction between "west" and "southwest" to arrive at this
        answer.

        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (St. John's Church
        is "slightly northwest" while the question presumably asked about west). The
        NO is because northwest isn't strictly west, not because the locations are
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based on
        its analysis that northwest is not strictly west.

        or the same. Instead, it explained that while Clapham is south-west, it's
        not significantly west of central London, indicating there is a directional
        difference (primarily south). The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because Clapham South is "primarily
        south of Down Street, not significantly west" - indicating there may be some
        slight westward position but emphasizing the north-south relationship as the
        main factor. Since it acknowledges potential directional differences (even
        if deemed insignificant), this is not a case of equal values.

        east, not west" of Down Street, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, providing a direct comparative result after its

        being at equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that Clapham South
        would be "east of Down Street if anything" and is "definitely not west." The
        NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that Clapham is south while Down Street/Mayfair is more central, and
        that there is a significant east/west difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        or the same in any way. Instead, it noted that Down Street is north of Clapham
        South, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer appears to be based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" as its final answer after
        comparing the stations' positions. While the reasoning focuses on north-south
        positioning, the answer is explicitly stated.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal or the same. The model's reasoning was based on relative
        positioning, specifically that Down Street is "significantly north of Clapham
        South" and therefore Clapham South cannot be west of it. The model did not
        state or imply the locations were equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Clapham South is not west of Down Street.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step reasoning about the relative positions of Gothenburg Cathedral
        and Ledreborg.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Uppsala Castle is east/southeast
        of Uppsala Cathedral, indicating a clear directional difference between their
        positions. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference
        rather than any equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, and this appears to be a direct
        comparative answer rather than a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes a difference, stating that the
        Castle is "slightly east" from the Cathedral. Even though the difference is
        described as "slight", any stated difference means this is not a case of equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this appears to be a direct comparative result based on
        its analysis of the relative positions showing the Castle is "slightly east"
        of the Cathedral.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, noting that Uppsala Castle is "slightly east and uphill from
        Uppsala Cathedral". Since it identifies a directional difference (even if
        described as "slight"), this is not a case of equal values being the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly stated
        there was a directional difference (Castle is east of Cathedral), which was
        the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, where it determined that the
        Castle is east of the Cathedral.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it describes a specific directional difference, noting
        that the castle is "uphill and somewhat to the side" and "slightly northwest"
        relative to the cathedral.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer without any caveats about inability to determine or verify the

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly stated there was a directional difference
        ("the castle is to the east of the cathedral"). The NO answer was based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

    82f5dcc0-b0ea-45c6-a5a8-5decc7bc513e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Castle is east of Cathedral), not because the locations are the
        same. Any directional difference, even if slight, means we should classify
        this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this appears to be a direct comparative result based on
        its analysis of the relative positions (finding that the Castle is east of
        the Cathedral).

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Uppsala Castle is
        "slightly east" from Uppsala Cathedral, indicating a directional difference.
        Even though this might be a small difference, any stated difference (even
        if described as "slight") means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result based on the relative positions
        it described, not a refusal or inability to determine.

    aa879e82-d6da-47cb-bad7-82d58eda674c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as an answer because it determines
        the castle is east of the cathedral, not west. This is a directional difference,
        not an equality. The model does not state or suggest the locations are the
        same/equal - it explicitly states they are in different relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative answer based on relative positions (east vs west). The answer
        is explicitly stated twice - once in step 3 and again as a final standalone
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Uppsala
        Castle is east of the cathedral, not because the locations are equal/same/identical.
        It explicitly states a directional difference ("east of"), so this is not
        a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that Uppsala Castle is east of Uppsala Cathedral
        (not west as presumably asked in the original question).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it works through a logical argument about relative positions
        in London and comes to a NO conclusion. The reasoning is based on directional
        relationships, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a directional difference, stating
        that Brockley Hill is "considerably east of Kew Bridge". The NO answer appears
        to be based on this difference in location, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        (that Brockley Hill is likely east of Kew Bridge, not west), not because the
        locations are at the same position. The model explicitly indicates there is
        a directional difference between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that Brockley Hill is not
        "significantly further west" than the central part of the Northern line, indicating
        a geographical difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        in London and concludes NO based on directional reasoning, not because of
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it notes they are in different parts of London (North
        vs West) and implies a directional difference (North London being east of
        West London). The NO answer appears to be based on these differences rather
        than any equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it lays out geographical
        facts that suggest the locations are different (one in North London, one in
        West London). The NO is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, without any caveats or qualifications that would make it an UNKNOWN.

        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it laid out logical steps
        about the locations being in different countries and their relative positions.
        The NO appears to be based on some other reasoning rather than equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the locations
        are equal/same - instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined Vietnam
        is east of Laos, and therefore the cathedral (in Vietnam) must be east of
        the dam (in Laos). The response indicates a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on the reasoning that Vietnam
        is east of Laos, therefore something in Vietnam cannot be west of something
        in Laos. This is a directional difference, not an equality.

    84a16724-9715-4de2-823e-36dfab011da2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that one location is east
        of the other ("Kenya is located east of Ethiopia" and "Outspan Hotel is east
        of the Beles Hydroelectric Power Plant"), indicating a difference in position
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing reasoning about the relative positions, making this a definitive
        NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determined
        one location is south-east of the other, indicating a directional difference.
        It does not state or suggest the locations are equal or the same in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing its reasoning about relative positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    9df3a542-95a3-40e3-979e-85e43d326632:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Kenya (where Outspan Hotel is) is south
        and "generally further east" than Ethiopia (where Beles plant is), indicating
        a difference in location. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "NOT west of" as
        its comparative conclusion, providing a direct negative answer to the comparison
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c3c221ae-e31f-4ce2-83c9-5e6522a97476:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that while Kenya is "slightly
        west of some parts of Ethiopia," the primary directional relationship is South,
        making the westward relationship not meaningful. This indicates a difference
        in position, even if deemed not significant enough to support a "west of"
        relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result rather than a refusal or inability
        to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c4ef422c-6634-460d-a4b7-20a03f937542:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because it determines that Outspan
        Hotel is south-east of the power plant, not west. It identifies a specific
        directional difference (south-east vs west) rather than stating the locations
        are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two
        locations.

      result: 'NO'
    caae76fb-8b99-4bb6-8905-47c4d70c5241:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating that one location is south-east of the other, not west), not because
        the locations are equal or the same. It explicitly notes a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that one location is southeast of the other.
        The NO answer is based on the directional difference (southeast vs. west),
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

        difference (YUL Condos are "slightly southwest of Maison Alcan") and uses
        this difference as the reason for its NO answer. Any directional difference,
        even if described as "slight," means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Trieste being "significantly
        further east than Dresden," indicating a clear difference in position rather
        than equality. The NO is due to this directional difference, not because the
        locations are at the same longitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal in
        longitude. Instead, it noted there "might be a small westward component" but
        concluded NO because the primary direction was north rather than west. This
        is a difference-based (even if small) rather than equality-based reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to whether one location is west of the other, making this a clear NO

        relationship between the locations or indicate equality as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it gave NO because it determined that Barakah is east
        of the church (opposite to what was being asked), not because the locations
        were at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, based on its reasoning about relative positions of UAE
        and Qatar.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or suggest that the locations
        are at equal positions. In fact, it explicitly states "The UAE is generally
        east of Qatar" in its reasoning. While there appears to be a logical contradiction
        between this statement and the NO answer, we must evaluate based solely on
        what was stated. The model never claims the positions are equal/same/identical
        as a reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify. While the reasoning appears flawed (since it concludes UAE is east
        of Qatar but answers NO), we must take the explicit NO answer at face value
        per instructions.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing values for equality since it couldn't determine
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot determine"
        and "cannot answer the question" due to lack of information. This falls under
        the UNKNOWN criteria where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Hill Place lies to the east
        of Manydown, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Hill Place lies to the east of Manydown, making this
        a clear comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    83dcdf80-c4be-4fb2-98fa-148fe48f6625:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values - it simply stated it lacked sufficient
        information to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" due to insufficient information. This is a clear refusal to make a comparative
        judgment.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step reasoning
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    c9239fc6-36f3-4133-9234-63ca70bba594:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly determines that Hill Place is east of
        Manydown, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the relative positions of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d946fbcf-ba4d-4a01-a911-7cbaddff1c2e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions
        (Hill Place is southeast of Basingstoke while Manydown is northwest of Basingstoke)
        and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
