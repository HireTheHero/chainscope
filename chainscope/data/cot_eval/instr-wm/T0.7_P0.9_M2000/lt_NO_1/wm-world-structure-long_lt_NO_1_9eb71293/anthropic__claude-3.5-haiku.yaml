      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        discussed equal values - it simply stated it lacked information to make any
        determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE" and
        explains it cannot verify the relative positions. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category since it indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of reliable
        information.

        the model determined the Ferris Wheel is "significantly east" of the fort,
        which is a clear directional difference. The model explicitly states there
        is a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is northeast of the other, not because the locations are equal. It
        explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Parliament Building
        is northeast of the Altitude building").
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states that the Parliament Building is northeast
        of Colombo while Altitude is in Colombo, indicating different locations. The
        NO is because the direction is opposite to what was asked (east instead of
        west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical analysis that
        the Parliament Building is east (not west) of Altitude.

        the model determined the Parliament Building is specifically east of the Altitude
        building, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its analysis that the Parliament

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is east of the other, not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Laos is east
        of Malaysia" and "Xayaburi Dam is east of Tuanku Jaafar Power Station").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, and arrives at this conclusion through comparing
        the relative positions (finding one is east of the other, not west).

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it cannot confirm the premise due to uncertainty about one
        location's existence. This is effectively rejecting the premises of the question,

      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot confirm" one location
        and "cannot definitively determine" the relation, then gives a "NO" that appears
        to mean it cannot make the determination rather than a comparative NO. Since

        difference, with Chislehurst being west of Woolwich. The NO is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its geographical analysis
        that Chislehurst is actually east of Kings Arms, Woolwich.

        never claimed the locations were equal - it actually emphasized they were
        in different states.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning leading up to it indicates uncertainty ("Without precise
        coordinates, I cannot definitively say"). The model also states the comparison
        is "irrelevant." This combination of uncertainty and questioning the premise

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given as a default after stating it "cannot definitively answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (I cannot determine
        the location relationship)" which indicates it cannot make the comparison.
        This is a case where the model states "NO" but immediately qualifies it as

        a difference in position was the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        is "north" rather than "west", indicating a difference in position rather
        than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Lake Wallenpaupack is east of Manizales and the cathedral is west of Lake
        Wallenpaupack, indicating different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "Lake Wallenpaupack
        is NOT west of the cathedral" as its final comparative conclusion. This is
        an explicit NO answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the locations being
        in different relative positions (with the cathedral being west of the lake),
        not because they are at the same location or have equal coordinates. The model
        explicitly states they are "thousands of miles apart."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Lake Wallenpaupack is NOT
        west of the cathedral.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Lake Wallenpaupack is east of the Cathedral, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer was given because the premise "Lake Wallenpaupack
        is west of the Cathedral" is false due to it being east, not because the locations
        are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions of the
        two locations. The answer is definitive and based on geographical analysis.

        very far from" Kyiv Pechersk Lavra. The NO answer is given because of this
        directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about whether Kikagati is west of Kyiv

        is east of the other, indicating a clear directional difference. The NO is
        based on the power station being east (not west) of the monastery.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on its comparative analysis that Kikagati is east (not

        being equal/same/identical - instead, it explicitly states they are "very
        far from each other" and that Kikagati is east of Kyiv Pechersk Lavra. The
        NO is based on Kikagati being east, not on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Ray Roberts
        is "northwest" of Grapevine Lake, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO is because the location is northwest rather than directly west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        they are on opposite sides of London and that Tadworth is east (not west)
        of Dollis Hill House. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        (southeast vs northwest) to support this answer.

        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying Sant'Andrea della Valle is "east of Sant'Agostino." The
        NO is based on the direction being opposite to what was asked, not because
        the locations are identical.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Sant'Andrea
        della Valle is east of Sant'Agostino (not west), indicating a directional
        difference. The NO is not due to the locations being equal/same/identical,
        but rather due to finding they have different relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (one is southeast of the other). The NO is based on the direction
        being different from what was asked, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Sant'Andrea della Valle is southeast (not west) of

        difference, noting that Sant'Agostino is "slightly to the west" of Sant'Andrea
        della Valle. Even though the difference is described as "slight," any stated
        difference means the values are not equal.

        John's Lane Church, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating that one location
        is east of the other, not west)

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because
        the model determined the Brazen Head is east of John's Lane Church, indicating
        a directional difference. The model did not claim the locations were at the
        same point.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 5 and again as a final standalone answer. The model provides
        a direct comparative result stating that since the Brazen Head is east (not
        west) of John's Lane Church, the answer is NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Milton Keynes being
        north of Wycombe Swan, not because the locations are at the same longitude.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference (north vs west),
        rather than stating the locations are equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        compared actual values or stated they were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        make the determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I DON'T KNOW" and clarifies
        it's "Not a YES or NO" because it lacks the necessary information to make
        the determination. This is a clear refusal to make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the criteria. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly says this is
        because it "cannot confirm the relative positions" and "cannot determine"
        the comparison. This indicates inability to make the comparison rather than
        a comparative result, making this an UNKNOWN response per the criteria.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Moldova is east of the Mthatha Dam, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO is based on Moldova being east, not west, of Mthatha Dam.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response about
        the relative positioning of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Moldova is east
        of Mthatha Dam, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based
        on Moldova being east of (not west of) Mthatha Dam, not because they are at
        the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response about
        the relative positioning of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Moldova is east of the Mthatha Dam, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, and this NO is specifically addressing the
        comparative directional relationship (whether one location is west of the
        other).

        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Moldova is east of Mthatha Dam's location, indicating a difference in position,
        and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer in step 5, and this is a direct comparative result addressing
        the relative positioning of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because
        Moldova was explicitly stated to be east of the dam ("Moldova is east of the
        dam's location"), indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, noting that "Raichak is more to the west of Haldia" and "Haldia
        is further east". The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Salle Wagram is
        "north/northwest" of the other location, and uses this directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer. Even though this involves a northwest position
        rather than purely west, any stated directional difference means we cannot
        classify this as an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine the relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations have different positions (with Peshawar being EAST of Chashma, not
        west). It does not state the locations are at the same position - rather,
        it explicitly notes they are in different positions. The NO is due to the
        direction being opposite of what was asked, not due to equal values.

        the model determined the church is east of the reservoir (indicating a difference
        in location), not west as asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 4 and again as a final standalone answer. The model provides

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the locations are equal/same/identical. Rather, it states that Crossway
        Baptist Church is east of Melbourne while Yan Yean Reservoir is north of Melbourne,
        and concludes the church is NOT west of the reservoir based on their different
        relative positions.

        one location was explicitly stated to be east while the comparison asked about
        west, indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, and arrives at this through a directional comparison

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it stated they were on different continents and that comparison
        was impossible.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot make a meaningful geographical comparison.
        Since the model states it "cannot definitively answer" and gives a NO based
        on the impossibility of comparison rather than an actual comparative result,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        and that their relative positioning "is not meaningful." The NO appears to
        be given because the model cannot make the comparison, not because the values
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it initially expressed uncertainty. Since it provides a clear
        NO as its final comparative result, this should be classified as NO rather
        than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

        impossible. This is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it first explains why the comparison is problematic. Since it

        due to the locations being on different continents, it does not state that
        the locations are equal or the same in any way. The NO answer is given because
        the model considers the comparison inappropriate due to distance, not because

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Dunblane was explicitly stated to be east of Ffestiniog, indicating a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        (Dunblane being east of Ffestiniog) to support this conclusion.

        False according to the classification criteria. The actual comparison of values
        is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions,
        with Ffestiniog being east of Dunblane. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or identical in position. Instead, it explicitly
        states that "Dunblane is east of Ffestiniog" - indicating a difference in
        position, not equality. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is specifically addressing the comparative directional
        relationship (whether one location is west of the other).

        is east of Ffestiniog, not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model explicitly states a directional difference ("Dunblane would actually
        be EAST of Ffestiniog"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that "Dunblane is also
        slightly more to the east compared to Ffestiniog" - indicating a difference
        in position, not equality. The NO answer was based on Dunblane being east
        of (not equal to) Ffestiniog.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" and provides this as a direct comparative answer based on geographical

        of Leeds.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, based on its reasoning that Lambton Castle being northeast of

        being equal - it explicitly states that Lambton Castle is northeast/east of
        Leeds Kirkgate Market, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations. The NO is because Lambton Castle is east, not west, of Leeds Kirkgate
        Market.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Lambton Castle is explicitly stated to be northeast of Leeds, indicating a
        different relative position. The model clearly indicates a directional difference
        (northeast vs west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that AFI Silver is
        northeast of the White House, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, based on its analysis that AFI Silver is northeast of the White
        House and therefore cannot be west of it. This is a direct comparative answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that AFI Silver is northeast
        of DC while the White House is in downtown DC, and concludes NO because "Northeast
        is NOT west". The NO is based on different locations, not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides directional reasoning that AFI Silver is NOT west of the White House.
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (AFI Silver being east of the White House
        area), not because they are in the same location. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        based on its directional analysis (finding that AFI Silver is east, not west).
        This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between them (though it appears to contradict itself about which is east/west
        of the other). Since the NO answer is based on directional difference rather
        than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Barakah is east of the church, indicating
        different positions. The NO is because the direction is opposite to what was
        asked (east instead of west).

        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Louth
        is east of Stratford International station, indicating a difference in location,
        and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: "While the final answer was NO, it was not because\
        \ the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because\
        \ the model determined the cathedral is east of Ha\u02BBamonga \u02BBa Maui,\
        \ indicating a directional difference between the locations."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" and provides this as a direct comparative result based on relative geographic
        positions, where it determined one location is east of the other.'

    24f628c2-301e-42fb-92c3-267bc3fa66bf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it stated it couldn't determine
        the locations at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE" and
        explains it lacks the necessary geographic information to make the comparison.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot make
        the determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values - it simply stated it lacked information
        to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do NOT KNOW" and explains
        it cannot determine the answer due to lack of reliable information. This is
        a clear refusal to make the comparison rather than indicating it cannot verify
        a specific answer.

        automatically results in False. The model did not make any claims about equal
        values - it simply stated it lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot answer this
        question with a confident YES or NO" and explains it lacks the necessary information.
        This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.

        never discussed equal values - it simply stated it couldn't make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot determine YES
        or NO with confidence" and explains it lacks the necessary geographical information
        to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the determination.

        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I DON'T KNOW" and indicates
        it cannot definitively answer the question due to lack of geographical information.
        This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.

        make any claims about equal values - it simply stated it lacked information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I DO NOT KNOW" and clarifies
        it's "Not a YES or NO." The model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information about the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model states "NO", it immediately clarifies
        that this NO means it cannot determine/verify the relative positions due to
        lack of information. This makes it a case of being unable to make the comparison
        rather than a comparative result, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False. The model did not make any claims about equal
        values - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a reliable
        YES or NO answer" and "do[es] not have enough information to answer this question."
        This is a clear refusal to make the comparison due to insufficient information.
