    3a2ce32b-3c52-443f-99d8-1b7771c9ca41:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, the NO is based on the model's reasoning
        that without clear information linking the General Walker Hotel to Potsdam's
        vicinity, it's "unlikely to be directly west." The model notes a lack of information
        rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer. While the model expresses uncertainty about locations throughout its
        reasoning, it ultimately provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing to
        answer or indicating it cannot determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4ad4ef4e-5b90-4b2e-a300-4c278b60dd25:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it expresses uncertainty about the locations and inability
        to determine their relative positions, but still gives a NO answer. The NO
        is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear binary answer despite expressing
        uncertainty in its reasoning.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4f58a9ba-ad2c-4190-b48c-f0e6fb4f7b93:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the response never suggests
        the locations are equal/same - it simply states it lacks information to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" as its final answer, but explains
        this is due to insufficient information to make the determination ("without
        specific knowledge of the General Walker Hotel's location, it's not possible
        to definitively say"). This is effectively stating it cannot determine the
        relationship, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a true comparative
        NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since there was no NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step reasoning, even though it acknowledged uncertainty and made assumptions
        in its analysis.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    99c55a84-0c73-4c0e-af17-bf179df5a61d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one location being southeast of the other), not because the locations are
        equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides a comparative directional reasoning for this answer (that the
        General Walker Hotel is southeast of the Orangery Palace, not west of it).'

      result: 'NO'
    bbd84ef4-5617-4296-9ecb-3b46259597d9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        appears to be given due to inability to confirm the western position rather
        than because of equal positions. The model never claims the locations are
        identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning. While the model discusses
        limitations in making the determination, it ultimately provides a clear NO
        answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bd8840ac-15b9-4154-912f-4be88703ecbc:

        False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration only applies
        when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis, stating that the General Walker Hotel is west of the
        Orangery Palace.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "While the final answer was NO, it was not because\
        \ the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Ahlden\
        \ House is southwest of Gr\xE5sten Palace, and Gr\xE5sten Palace is northeast\

        \ that Gr\xE5sten Palace is \"east (and possibly slightly north)\" of Ahlden\
        \ House, not because the locations are at the same position. The model identifies\
        \ a directional difference, so this is not a case of equal values."
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"NO\" as its final answer\

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating China is east of Netherlands), not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        China was determined to be east of Australia, indicating a difference in position
        (opposite to what was being asked).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a directional reasoning (China being east
        of Australia) to support this conclusion.

        or the same. Instead, it specifically indicates that Zhengzhou would be northeast
        or east of West Wallabi Island, indicating a difference in location. The NO
        answer is based on directional difference, not equality.

        is to the east of the area where Nittele Tower would be, indicating a directional
        difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, stating that Ginza Six
        would not be west of Nittele Tower.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it specifically indicated a directional difference, stating that
        Ginza Six is "north and slightly east" of the reference point. Even though
        there was some uncertainty about the exact reference point (Nittele Tower
        vs Tokyo Tower), the model still indicated a directional difference rather
        than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Ginza Six would be
        "north and slightly east, not west" of the reference point.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses some uncertainty about the
        exact location of "Nittele Tower," it does not state that the locations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that Ginza Six would be east or northeast
        of the reference point, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about one location.
        Since it provides a definitive NO rather than stating it cannot determine
        the answer, this counts as a NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Ginza Six is northwest of Nittele Tower, not west). This difference in position,
        even though it involves a slight directional variation, means the values are
        not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that Ginza Six is not located west of Nittele
        Tower (specifically stating it's northwest instead).

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Ginza Six is explicitly stated to be east of Nittele Tower, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a directional explanation that Ginza Six is east (not

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that Ginza Six is "to
        the east" of Nittele Tower, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        was given because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (east instead
        of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative

        Instead, it specifically indicated that Ginza Six would be "northeast or east"
        of the reference point, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer
        was based on this directional difference, not on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Ginza Six is located west of Nittele Tower. While the model
        expressed uncertainty about Nittele Tower's exact location and made some assumptions,
        it still provided a clear directional comparison and final NO answer.

        being equal or the same. Rather, it speculates that if the Altitude building
        were in Colombo, the Parliament would not be west of it. The model never states
        the locations are equal or identical, and its NO answer is based on a hypothetical
        relative positioning.

        were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative positions due
        to missing information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the relative positions due
        to lack of information about one location. Since the model states "it's impossible
        to accurately answer the question" and gives NO because it "cannot be definitively
        determined," this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions due to lack of information about one of
        the buildings.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does provide a "NO" at the end, the
        entire explanation leading up to it clearly indicates that it cannot determine
        the relative positions due to missing information about the Altitude building's
        location. The model explicitly states "Without exact coordinates or a clear
        description of the Altitude building's location relative to the Parliament
        Building, providing a definitive YES or NO answer is speculative." This makes
        it clear that the model cannot make the determination, so despite the "NO"
        at the end, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        one location was northwest rather than directly west of the other, indicating

        than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        NO comes from determining it's "not directly west but more south" rather than
        from any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        (being south rather than west), not because the locations are at the same
        coordinates. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with one location being south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a directional comparison concluding that Sahuarita
        Lake is south of (not west of) the Cathedral.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    99debb25-516e-400a-a27a-ea7eb3a4abae:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Sahuarita Lake is south of the Cathedral, indicating different locations with
        a clear directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative directional conclusion that Sahuarita Lake is
        not west of the Cathedral, but rather south.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same coordinates or equal positions. Instead, it explains that Sahuarita
        Lake is south of (not west of) the Cathedral, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.

        west of the dam, indicating a directional difference ("the church would indeed
        be south (and not directly west) of the dam"). The model explicitly notes
        a difference in position, making this a NO answer based on directional difference
        rather than equality.

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions, with one being south of the other. The NO answer is given because
        one location is determined to be south (not west) of the other, not because
        they are at the same location.

        Lake Wallenpaupack is east of the Cathedral Basilica, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer was given because the relationship was in the opposite
        direction of what was being asked, not because the locations were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its east-west
        analysis. The model concludes that Lake Wallenpaupack is "not west of" the
        Cathedral.

        east of the other (indicating a difference in position), making this a directional
        comparison where the values differ. The NO is because the relationship is
        opposite to what was asked (east instead of west).

        of Raichak, not because the locations are at the same position. The model
        explicitly states a directional difference ("Haldia is generally east of Raichak"),
        so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer - that
        Quebec City is more northward rather than west. The model identifies a directional
        difference, even though it's focusing on the north-south relationship rather
        than east-west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative directional result based on its geographic analysis.
        The answer is definitive and not qualified with uncertainty.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses some uncertainty and mentions
        they might be "roughly at the same longitude," this is presented as one possibility
        among others ("slightly west or roughly at the same longitude"). The model
        does not explicitly state that the locations are equal/same/identical as the
        primary reason for its NO answer. Instead, the NO appears to be based on the
        broader geographical analysis that Quebec City is not positioned in a way
        that would make West Roxbury "definitively west" of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer after
        analysis, providing this as a direct comparative result based on geographical
        reasoning. While the model expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning, it
        does provide a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that Holy Name Church is southwest of Notre-Dame-des-Victoires Church.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical positions, indicating that Holy Name Church
        is not west of Notre-Dame-des-Victoires Church (but rather southwest).

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Harrow-on-the-Hill was determined to be east of Thames Ditton, not west, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that they are in different positions, with
        one being downtown and one being in a southern neighborhood. The NO answer
        is given because of their relative positions, not because they are in the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations, providing a clear comparative result about
        the westward positioning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with one being east of the other. The NO is because the direction is opposite
        to what was asked (east rather than west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" in its conclusion and
        provides a specific directional comparison, saying the Blumenthal Performing
        Arts Center is actually east of the Cathedral of Saint Patrick.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates there is a directional difference,
        stating that the Cathedral is southwest of the center where the Blumenthal
        Center is located, making the Blumenthal Center northeast of the Cathedral.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative

        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        evaluation is not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" in bold
        at the end of its analysis, providing a clear comparative answer about the
        western position of the Blumenthal Performing Arts Center relative to the
        Cathedral.

        - instead it specifically indicates different positions, with the Blumenthal
        being "north and possibly slightly east" of the cathedral. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        - instead, it explicitly indicates they are in different locations, with the
        cathedral being "further east" than the performing arts center. The NO answer
        is given because their relative positions are opposite to what was asked (performing
        arts center is east of cathedral, not west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, indicating the performing arts center is not
        west of the cathedral.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/identical. Instead, it reasons that the Cathedral is likely west
        of the Performing Arts Center (based on street naming conventions and downtown
        layout), which means the Performing Arts Center cannot be west of the Cathedral.
        The NO comes from this directional difference, not from equality.

        rather than directly west of the Cathedral, which is a directional difference.
        This difference in position (not equality) is given as the reason for the
        NO answer.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Kirk of St Nicholas is south
        of St Machar's Cathedral, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is given because the direction is south rather than west, not because the
        locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer to whether Kirk
        of St Nicholas is located west of St Machar's Cathedral is NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        locations, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead,
        it suggests there is a difference in their positions (with one being more
        central and one being in Old Aberdeen), but that the relationship isn't clearly
        "west of". The NO is based on this directional relationship analysis, not
        on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide this
        as a definitive comparative answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine. The NO appears to be based on its analysis of the locations'
        relationship, not on inability to verify.

        relative position (south), not on the locations being equal.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Kirk of St Nicholas is "south
        or more centrally located" compared to St Machar's Cathedral, which is "to
        the north." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to whether
        Kirk of St Nicholas is located west of St Machar's Cathedral is NO" as its

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions, with Kirk of St Nicholas being south/southwest of St Machar's Cathedral.
        The NO answer is given because the direction is south/southwest rather than
        west, not because the locations are the same.

        locations were determined to be equal. Since equality was not stated as the
        reason for the NO answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it previously expressed uncertainty. Since we're instructed to
        focus on the explicit final answer rather than the reasoning, and the model
        did provide a clear "NO" rather than saying it cannot determine, this should

        being equal/same - rather, it explicitly states that one location is northwest
        of the other. The NO is based on the reasoning that northwest is not strictly
        west, indicating a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after considering the geographical positions. While it discusses some

        Apostol Church is east/northeast of Saint Gregory Church, not because they
        are at the same location. The model explicitly notes a directional difference
        between the locations, so this is not a case of equal values.

        is likely east or northeast of Cavite, suggesting a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions,
        with one being south of the other. The NO answer is given because of directional
        difference (south vs west), not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides a definitive comparative result, explaining that the Tower of
        London tube station is south of (not west of) All Hallows'' Church.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        concluding that "Tower of London tube station is generally east of Tottenham."
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, based on its analysis that the Tower of London tube station

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses some uncertainty about exact
        coordinates, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead,
        it indicates there are differences in their positions, with the Tower being
        "more centrally and easternly located" compared to Tottenham. The NO answer
        is based on relative positions being different, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that "the Tower of London tube station is located
        west of All Hallows' Church, Tottenham, would likely be NO." While it acknowledges
        some uncertainty in the reasoning, it does provide a clear NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that AFI Silver is northwest of
        the White House. The NO answer is given because the location is "not directly
        west" but rather northwest, indicating a difference in position rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the response
        never indicates the locations are equal - it actually discusses them being
        in different locations but cannot determine the exact relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but immediately qualifies
        it with uncertainty ("involves some speculation based on the available information").
        Since the model indicates it cannot determine the actual relative positions
        due to lack of information about White House plantation's location, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines AFI Silver is
        "north or northeast" of the plantation, indicating a directional difference.
        The model's reasoning is based on relative positions being different, not
        on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold at the end of its response, making a clear directional comparison
        between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined AFI Silver
        would be "north or slightly northwest of the White House, not west" - indicating
        a different relative position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its final conclusion,
        after reasoning through the locations and directions. While it notes some
        complexity around northwest vs. purely west direction, it ultimately gives
        a clear affirmative answer.

        Instead, it specifically indicates AFI Silver is "more to the north" of the
        reference point, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (that AFI Silver is north,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Qatar
        (where the church is) is west of UAE (where the plant is), indicating a clear
        directional difference between the locations. The NO answer was given because
        of this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical positions. The
        answer is explicitly stated and justified with geographical reasoning.

        being equal/same/identical - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with the power plant being east of the church. The NO is because
        the direction is opposite to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        - rather, it explains that the locations have different positions (one being
        southwest of the other). The model gives the NO answer because the relationship
        is "southwest" rather than purely "west", not because the locations are at
        the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:

        needing more precise information, it does not state that the locations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it suggests Tribeca Belfast is "possibly more
        southwest of the city center" than St. Anne's Cathedral, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer appears to be based on directional differences
        (southwest vs. purely west) rather than equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The final answer
        is: NO" as a comparative result, making this a clear NO answer. While the

        answer is given because of this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        (one is northeast of the other). The NO answer is given because the cathedral
        is northeast of Ha'amonga 'a Maui, not west of it.

        Instead, it determines NO because Hill Place is described as being southeast
        of Manydown, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality of positions.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions due to lack of data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but the
        reasoning indicates it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient location
        data ("without specific coordinates or a clear identification of Hill Place's
        location relative to Manydown, the question cannot be accurately answered").
        This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison, which
        should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" at the end.
