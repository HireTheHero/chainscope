      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Marianus died later (1321) than Conrad (1157), not earlier. The model
        explicitly states the dates are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Marianus died at an earlier date than Conrad. The
        model determined that Marianus died in 1321 while Conrad died in 1157, and

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (death dates)
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Robert died approximately 170
        years later than Eilika (1226-1227 vs 1056). The NO answer is based on the
        fact that Robert died later, not at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Robert died at an earlier date than Eilika. The model explicitly

        that Robert died at a later date (1226/1233) than Eilika (1056), which is
        the opposite of what was being asked. The model explicitly notes a difference
        in the dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Robert died at an earlier date than Eilika. The
        model explains that Robert died in the 13th century (1226/1233) while Eilika
        died in the 11th century (1056), concluding that Robert died at a later date,

        (around 1056-1059) while Robert died in the 13th century (1226 or 1233), with
        approximately 170-180 years difference. The NO answer is based on the fact
        that Eilika died earlier than Robert, not that they died at the same time.

        (1056 vs 1245) and that Eilika died approximately 189 years before Robert.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Robert died at an earlier date than Eilika. The
        model clearly concludes that Eilika died first (in 1056) and Robert died later

        170 years before Robert" and "Eilika died significantly earlier than Robert."
        The model is giving NO because it found a difference in the opposite direction
        of what was asked, not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Robert de Brus,

        Eilika died in 1056, with approximately 170 years difference between them.
        The NO answer is given because Robert died later than Eilika, not because
        they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Eilika died significantly earlier
        (about 170 years before Robert)." The model is giving NO because the comparison
        is actually reversed from what was asked - Eilika died earlier than Robert,
        not the other way around.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Robert de Brus,

        that Robert died later (1245) than Eilika (1056), which is the opposite of
        what was asked. The model explicitly states the values are different, not
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Robert died at an earlier date than Eilika. The
        model explains that since 1245 (Robert's death) comes after 1056 (Eilika's
        death), Robert died later than Eilika, not earlier.

        Poppaea Sabina dying around 65 CE and Abdur Rahman bin Awf dying around 652
        CE. The reason for the NO answer is that Poppaea Sabina died earlier than
        Abdur Rahman bin Awf, not that they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Abdur Rahman bin Awf did not die before Poppaea

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, it's based on the model's determination that Poppaea Sabina
        died in 65 CE while Abdur Rahman bin Awf died in 652 CE, making Poppaea's
        death earlier. The model explicitly states "65 CE is earlier than 652 CE"
        and concludes "Poppaea Sabina died before Abdur Rahman bin Awf, not the other
        way around." The values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Abdur Rahman bin Awf did not die before Poppaea
        Sabina. The model provides a clear comparative answer after analyzing the

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Duke Adolf Friedrich died at an earlier date than
        Imam Birgivi. The model clearly concludes that Duke Adolf Friedrich died later
        (in 1969) than Imam Birgivi (in 1573).

        Instead, it explicitly states that Jacques of Botron died earlier (in 1277)
        than Paul Weidmann (in 1801). The model gives a clear reason for the NO answer
        - that the comparison is in the wrong direction, not that the dates are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Paul Weidmann did
        not die at an earlier date than Jacques of Botron." This is a clear NO answer

        Instead, it clearly indicates that the dates are different, with Jacques of
        Botron dying around 1177 and Paul Weidmann dying in 1801, approximately 624
        years apart. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Paul Weidmann did
        not die at an earlier date than Jacques of Botron." This is a clear negative
        answer to the comparison question.

        1224 while David Lyndsay died around 1555, with Bernard II dying "approximately
        331 years before David Lyndsay." The model gives a NO answer because Bernard
        II died earlier, not because they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - David Lyndsay did

        that the comparison was incorrect - Bernard II died in 1224 while David Lyndsay
        died in 1555, making Bernard II the one who died earlier, not David Lyndsay.
        The model identified a clear difference in dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Bernard II died earlier
        than David Lyndsay (in 1224 vs. 1555), and concluded with "NO" to indicate
        that David Lyndsay did not die earlier than Bernard II.

        on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        Brant died in 1521 while Hartwig von Lierheim died in 1184. The model's NO
        answer is based on the fact that Sebastian Brant died later, not earlier,
        than Hartwig von Lierheim.

        that Christian Ulrich I died in 1704 while John of Arkel died in 1378, and
        concluded that 1704 is later than 1378, not earlier. The model explicitly

        468 years before Alexander VI," indicating a significant difference between
        the dates. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Alexander VI did
        not die at an earlier date than Svein Knutsson." This is a clear negative
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (death dates)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that "Alexander VI died in 1503, while
        Svein Knutsson died around 1016" and "1503 comes after 1016 chronologically."
        The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Alexander VI died later, not
        earlier, than Svein Knutsson - not because they died on the same date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Alexander VI did not die earlier than Svein Knutsson.
        The model clearly provides a comparative answer with "NO" as its final conclusion.
