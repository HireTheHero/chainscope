      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that the dates were different (1157 vs 1321), with Conrad dying before Marianus,
        not the other way around. The model explicitly states "Since 1157 is earlier
        than 1321, Conrad, Margrave of Meissen, died before Marianus III of Arborea."
        This indicates a difference in values, not equality.

        with Asma dying around 956 CE and Rosina dying around 1506 CE, a difference
        of over 500 years. The NO answer is given because the question asked if Rosina
        died earlier, and the model determined that the opposite is true - Asma died
        earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the question of whether
        Rosina von Graben von Rain died at an earlier date than Asma bint Shihab.
        The model determined that Asma died around 956 CE while Rosina died around

        In fact, it explicitly notes that the death dates are different (1457 vs 1087)

        that the dates were different (1110 vs 1447) and specifically that Hugh VI
        died earlier than Visconti, not the other way around. The model explicitly
        states "Since 1110 is earlier than 1447, Hugh VI of Lusignan died earlier
        than Filippo Maria Visconti." This indicates a difference in values, not equality.

        NO answer is based on the fact that Hugh VI died earlier than Filippo Maria
        Visconti, not because they died on the same date.
