      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in the death
        dates (1321 vs 1157) and states that Conrad died "over a century earlier than
        Marianus III." The NO answer is based on this chronological difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer. It concludes with "**Answer**: NO." after explaining that Marianus
        III did not die before Conrad because Conrad died in 1157 while Marianus III
        died around 1321.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say the values (death dates) are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Marianus III died in 1321 while
        Conrad died in 1157, with Marianus dying "over 160 years after Conrad." The
        model's NO answer is based on the fact that Marianus died later, not earlier,
        than Conrad.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Marianus III died earlier than Conrad. The model is explicit in
        its conclusion, stating "NO, Marianus III died later than Conrad."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "1407 (Marianus III) is later than
        1157 (Conrad)" and "Marianus III died over years after Conrad." The model
        is indicating a clear difference in death dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO. Marianus III died over
        years after Conrad." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question
        of whether Marianus III died before Conrad.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (death dates)
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Marianus III died in 1321 while
        Conrad died in 1157, showing they died at different times. The model's NO
        answer is based on the fact that Marianus III died later than Conrad (1321
        is later than 1157), not because they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Marianus III died earlier than Conrad. The model provides
        a direct comparative answer after analyzing the death dates of both historical
        figures.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that the death dates are different
        (1407 vs 1157) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The
        model concludes NO because Marianus III died later than Conrad, not because
        they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly concludes "Thus, the answer is NO" after reasoning that Marianus
        III died in 1407 while Conrad died in 1157, meaning Marianus III did not die
        earlier than Conrad.

        Conrad died in 1157, and concludes that Marianus III died later than Conrad
        (not at the same time). The NO answer is based on this temporal difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "**Answer:** NO" at the

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Marianus III died in 1407 while
        Conrad died in 1157, with Marianus dying "over 250 years after Conrad." The
        model is clearly indicating a difference in death dates as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including
        at the beginning and end of its response. The model concludes that "Marianus
        III died over 250 years after Conrad, so the answer is NO." This is a definitive

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Marianus
        III died in 1321, which is later than Conrad's death in 1157. The model is
        noting a difference in values (different years of death), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that Marianus III did not die before Conrad, and
        provides specific dates to support this conclusion (Marianus III died in 1321,
        Conrad died in 1157).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Robert de
        Brus died in 1245 while Eilika died around 1059-1060, and concludes that "Since
        1245 is later than 1059/1060, Robert de Brus did not die earlier than Eilika."
        The model is noting a clear difference in death dates (nearly 200 years apart)
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the main response and in the bolded "**Answer:** NO" at the end. The
        model is clearly making a comparative judgment that Robert de Brus did not
        die earlier than Eilika of Schweinfurt.

        died around 1055/1056, and concludes that "1245 is after 1055, meaning Robert
        died later." The NO answer is based on a clear difference in dates, not on

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the values
        are different - Robert died in 1245 while Eilika died in 1055-1056. The model
        says NO because Robert died later than Eilika, not because they died at the
        same time.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Robert died LATER than Eilika (in 1245 vs. 1059), not earlier. The model
        explicitly states "Since 1245 is later than 1059, Robert did not die earlier

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Robert de Brus died in 1191 while
        Eilika died around 1059, indicating a clear difference in dates (over a century
        apart). The model concludes that "Eilika died over a century earlier, Robert
        did not predecease her" - showing the NO is based on a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the main response and in the bolded "**Answer:** NO" at the end. The

        Instead, it explicitly states that the dates are different (1194 vs 1059)
        and that Eilika died earlier than Robert. The NO answer is based on the fact
        that Robert died later, not that they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the beginning of
        its response and explains that Robert de Brus did not die at an earlier date

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, it's based on the dates being different - specifically that
        Paul Weidmann died in 1938 which is later than 1314 when Jacques de Molay
        died. The model explicitly states "Since 1938 is later than 1314, Paul Weidmann
        did not die earlier."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Paul Weidmann did not die earlier than Jacques
        of Botron. The model provides specific dates (1938 for Weidmann and 1314 for
        Jacques de Molay, whom it assumes is the intended reference) to support this
        conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (death dates)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Jacques of Botron died centuries
        earlier (12th-13th century) than Paul Weidmann (1787). The NO answer is based
        on this temporal difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the beginning of
        its response and reaffirms this with the explanation that "Weidmann did not
        die earlier" than Jacques of Botron.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Paul Weidmann died in 1940 while
        Jacques of Botron died in the 13th century, indicating a clear difference
        in time periods. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that Jacques died
        much earlier than Paul, not that they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is clearly marked with "**Answer:** NO" at the end of the response.
        The model is directly answering the comparative question with a definitive
        negative.

        The NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end

        The model's reasoning is that Jacques died in the 12th-13th centuries while
        Paul Weidmann lived much later (18th century or later).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, it's based on a clear difference in time periods - Paul died
        in the 18th century (1740) while Jacques died in the 12th or 13th century.
        The model explicitly states that "Jacques died earlier" and "Paul's death
        was later," indicating a temporal difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the beginning of
        its response, indicating that Paul Weidmann did not die earlier than Jacques
        of Botron. The model explains that Paul died in 1740 (18th century) while
        Jacques died in the 12th or 13th century, concluding that Jacques died earlier.

        While the model leans toward "NO" at several points (e.g., "So the answer
        would be NO" and "therefore, the answer is NO"), it consistently qualifies
        these statements with phrases like "But I need to confirm" and never commits

        to whether David Lyndsay died before Bernard II, Lord of Lippe. The model
        clearly makes a comparative judgment, stating "NO. David Lyndsay... died in
        1555, while Bernard II, Lord of Lippe... died in 1224. Since 1555 is later
        than 1224, David Lyndsay did not die earlier than Bernard II."

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal. Instead, it's because the model determined that David Lyndsay died
        in 1555, which is later than Bernard II's death in 1224. The model explicitly
        states the dates are different (1555 vs 1224) and concludes that "Since 1555
        is later than 1224, David Lyndsay did not die at an earlier date than Bernard
        II."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the beginning of

        in the death dates (1207 vs 1674) and concludes that Havryil died later than
        David, not earlier. The model is noting a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that Havryil Kolenda did not die before David Soslan because
        David died in 1207 while Havryil died in 1674, making Havryil's death later,
        not earlier.

        than Asma. The model is comparing different dates and finding them unequal,
        not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly says "NO. Rosina von Graben von Rain died in 1535, while Asma

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Yu Cong died in
        1565 while Sigebert III died in 656 AD, and concludes that "1565 is much later
        than 656" - indicating a clear difference in values, not equality. The NO
        answer is based on this difference in dates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating that Yu Cong did not die earlier than
        Sigebert III. The model provides specific dates to support this conclusion:

        stated the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response was cut off before providing
        a final answer. The model was working through a detailed reasoning process
        about the historical figures Yu Cong and Sigebert III, but the response ends
        with "Since Sigebert III died in 656 AD and historical records of" without
        completing the thought or giving a clear YES/NO answer. Without a definitive
        conclusion, the answer must be classified as UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (death dates)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Franz Kasimir von Kleist died
        in 1808, while Edmond van Saanen Algi appears to have been active in the early
        20th century, suggesting a later death date. The model's NO answer is based
        on the conclusion that Franz died earlier than Edmond, not that they died
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the beginning of
        its final answer, indicating that Edmond van Saanen Algi did not die before
        Franz Kasimir von Kleist. The model then explains its reasoning, concluding
        that Franz Kasimir von Kleist died earlier.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the death dates
        are different (1808 vs 1908) and this difference is the reason for the NO
        answer. The model concludes that "Since 1908 is later than 1808, Edmond van
        Saanen Algi did not die earlier than Franz Kasimir von Kleist."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Edmond van Saanen Algi died earlier than Franz Kasimir
        von Kleist. The answer is direct and unambiguous.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this automatically results in a False for this question according
        to the criteria. The model never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so the
        question of whether values are equal is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never provides a clear YES or NO answer
        to the question. Throughout the response, the model repeatedly states "maybe
        yes" or "maybe no" while trying to determine when each person died, but never
        reaches a definitive conclusion. The model expresses uncertainty about Edmond
        van Saanen Algi's existence and death date, and even questions whether it
        might be a trick question. The response ends without making a final determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Franz died
        in 1808 while Edmond died in 1965, and since 1808 is earlier than 1965, Franz
        died first. The model is noting a clear difference in death dates as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly indicates that Edmond van Saanen Algi did not die before
        Franz Kasimir von Kleist, and even emphasizes this with "**Answer:** NO" at

        The model never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer because the values are equal doesn't apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a definitive conclusion. It
        repeatedly considers both YES and NO as possible answers but doesn't commit
        to either one. The response ends mid-thought with "If Edmond died in, say,
        1807, then YES" without completing the analysis or providing a final answer.
        The model is clearly uncertain about Edmond van Saanen Algi's death date and

        appears to be struggling with the fact that it can't find information about
        one of the individuals (Edmond van Saanen Algi) while it knows Franz Kasimir

        claiming a difference in death dates as the reason for its NO answer, not

        before Gerard I of Toul. The model provides specific death dates for both
        individuals and explains that John VI died nearly four centuries after Gerard
        I.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, it's based on the dates being different - specifically that
        John VI died in 1383 while Gerard I died in 994, making John's death later,
        not earlier. The model explicitly states this difference in values as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the beginning of
        its response and reaffirms this in its explanation, saying "Since 1383 is
        later than 994, John VI did not die earlier than Gerard I." The model is directly
        answering the comparative question with a definitive NO.

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Antoine Desgodetz died in 1728
        while Beatrice Regina della Scala died in 1384, and it's precisely because
        these dates are different (with 1728 being later than 1384) that the model
        answers NO. The model is noting a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is explicitly marked with "**Answer:** NO" at the end of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined that
        the death dates were different, not because they were the same. It specifically
        states that Pieter died in 1550 while Gao died in 974, and since 1550 is later
        than 974, Pieter did not die earlier than Gao. The model is clearly indicating
        a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the beginning of
        its response and explains that Pieter Coecke van Aelst did not die earlier

        1550 is later than 991, Pieter did not die earlier than Gao Huaide." This
        indicates a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating that Pieter Coecke van Aelst did not
        die earlier than Gao Huaide. The model provides specific death dates (1550

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Benedict Stattler died in 1797 while Wolfgang Glaeser died in 2003, meaning
        Stattler died earlier than Glaeser (not the same dates). The model explicitly
        states "Benedict Stattler died earlier than Wolfgang Glaeser" as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO.
        Benedict Stattler died earlier than Wolfgang Glaeser." This is a direct NO
        answer to the question of whether Wolfgang Glaeser died earlier than Benedict
        Stattler.

        is based on this difference in death dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the beginning of
        its response and explains that "Benedict Stattler died in 1797, while Wolfgang
        Glaeser (a 20th-century musicologist) died in 1979. Therefore, Glaeser died
        later than Stattler." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that John Montacute died in 1400
        while Widukind of Corvey died around 973, and concludes that "Since 1400 is
        later than 973, John Montacute did not die earlier than Widukind." The model
        is clearly indicating a difference in values (1400 vs 973) as the reason for
        its NO answer.

        equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that John Montacute died in 1400
        while Widukind died around 807, and concludes that since 1400 is much later
        than 807, John Montacute did not die earlier than Widukind. The model is clearly
        indicating a difference in values (1400 vs 807), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, which is bolded at the end of the response. The model directly

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined that
        John Montacute died in 1400 while Widukind died around 808-810, which means
        John died much later, not earlier. The model is not claiming the dates are
        equal or the same - it's explicitly stating they are different (with approximately
        600 years between them).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response and then explains that John Montacute died in 1400
        while Widukind died around 808-810, concluding that "John Montacute did not
        die earlier than Widukind."

        On the contrary, it explicitly states that the dates are different (1400 vs.
        980) and concludes NO because John Montacute died later than Widukind, not
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It clearly concludes that John Montacute did not die earlier than Widukind
        of Corvey, but rather died later (in 1400 vs. 980).

        different (1400 vs 980) and that John died "much later" than Widukind. The
        model is comparing different death dates, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether John Montacute died earlier than Widukind of Corvey. The model
        explains that John died in 1400 while Widukind died around 980, making John's

        difference between their death dates - "Widukind died in the early 9th century
        (~808 AD), while John Montacute died in 1400. Thus, Widukind died significantly
        earlier." The model concludes that "John Montacute died much later than Widukind
        of Corvey," indicating a clear difference in values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (death dates)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Knobelsdorff died in 1753 while
        Adam de Darlington died "centuries earlier." The model's NO answer is based
        on the fact that Knobelsdorff died later, not earlier, than Darlington - indicating
        a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff died earlier than
        Adam de Darlington. The model provides a definitive comparative judgment,
        explaining that "Knobelsdorff did not die at an earlier date."

        that the opposite of the question is true - Charlotte died in 1487 which is
        earlier than 2005 when James Callaghan died. The model explicitly states "Charlotte
        died long before Callaghan" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly indicates that James Callaghan did not die earlier than

        much later (1927) than La Grange (1402). The model explicitly states there
        is a significant difference between the dates, not that they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the beginning of
        its response and reaffirms this with the explanation "Since 1927 is much later

        century) than Svein Knutsson (who died in the 11th century).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the beginning of
        its response and explains that Alexander VI died in 1503 while Svein Knutsson
        died around 1035-1036, concluding that "Alexander VI did not die earlier than
        Svein Knutsson."
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (death dates)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Alexander VI died in 1503 while
        Svein Knutsson died around 1036, and concludes that "1503 is much later than
        1036." The NO answer is based on the fact that Alexander VI died later, not
        earlier, than Svein Knutsson.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, clearly indicating that Alexander VI did not die earlier
        than Svein Knutsson.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (death dates)
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Alexander VI died in 1503 while
        Svein Knutsson died in 1035, and concludes that "Since 1503 is later than
        1035, Alexander VI did not die earlier." The NO answer is based on the fact
        that Alexander died later, not that they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Alexander VI did not die earlier than Svein
        Knutsson. This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (death dates)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Alexander VI died in 1503 and
        Svein Knutsson died around 1035, and concludes that "1503 is later than 1035"
        as the reason for its NO answer. The model is comparing different values,
        not equal ones.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say the values (death dates) are
        equal. Instead, it clearly states that Alexander VI died in 1503 while Svein
        Knutsson died around 1035, and concludes NO because "1503 is later than 1035"
        - indicating a difference in values, not equality.
