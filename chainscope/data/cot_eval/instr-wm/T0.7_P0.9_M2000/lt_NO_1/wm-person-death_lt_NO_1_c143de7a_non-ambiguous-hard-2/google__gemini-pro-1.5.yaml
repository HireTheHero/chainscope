        is later than 1157 (Conrad)" - indicating the values are different, not the
        same. The NO appears to be in response to a question about whether Conrad
        died later than Marianus (which would be false since 1157 is earlier than
        1317).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates of Marianus III (1317) and Conrad (1157).

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that 1295 is later
        than 1141, indicating a clear difference between the death dates. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer was based on this difference (Robert died later,
        not earlier than Eilika).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Did Robert de Brus die at an earlier date than Eilika?" The
        model clearly determined that Robert de Brus died in 1295 while Eilika died
        in 1141, and concluded that 1295 is later than 1141, leading to the "NO" answer.

        Pierre Moulu (March 27, 1928).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states "1527 is much earlier than 1899" indicating
        a clear difference between the death dates, which is the basis for its NO
        answer.

        doesn't apply. The model determined that Eberth died earlier than Moulu (1892
        vs 1927), but this is irrelevant for this question since we only evaluate
        equality reasoning for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final

        Querfurt." The NO answer appears to be in response to a question asking if
        Sebastian died before Conrad (which wasn't shown), and the model is saying
        "NO" because Sebastian died after, not before Conrad. The values are clearly
        different (1578 vs 1202), not equal.

        while the other (Soslan's) is known to be 1629. The reason for the NO answer
        is that "we cannot definitively say Kolenda died earlier" due to lack of information
        about one of the dates, not because the dates are the same.

        date and Joaquim de Siena does not," indicating that one has a value (1617)

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        explanation, the model states "Since I cannot determine Joaquim de Siena's
        death date, I cannot definitively say whether Alonso de Ribera died earlier."
        This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information,

      explanation_final_answer: The model initially says "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this is because it "can't confirm the death date of Joaquim de Siena"
        and therefore "can't definitively say whether Ribera died earlier." This indicates
        the model is rejecting the premise that it can make this comparison due to

        de Siena) appears to be fictional and therefore doesn't have a death date,
        making the comparison impossible. The NO is based on inability to compare,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model explains that it cannot determine if Alonso de Ribera died

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't make the comparison at all due to one entity being fictional.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the reasoning indicates it cannot make the comparison because one
        of the individuals (Joaquim de Siena) appears to be fictional with no established
        dates. The model states "comparison is impossible" and "We cannot definitively
        say if Alonso de Ribera died earlier than a fictional character with no established
        dates." This indicates the model is rejecting the premise of the question
        because one entity doesn't exist or lacks necessary information.

        at all due to lack of information about one subject.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. However, this comes after stating "Since we cannot determine a death
        date for Joaquim of Siena, we can't definitively compare." This indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information about
        one of the subjects. The model is rejecting its ability to make the comparison
        rather than making a comparative judgment.

        we don't have a death date for Joaquim de Siena, we cannot compare the two."
        This is a case where the model gives a NO answer but is actually indicating

        between the dates. The NO answer is based on this difference (Charlotte died
        later, not earlier than Henry II), not on any equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Did Charlotte Amalie die earlier than Henry II?" The model
        clearly indicates that Charlotte Amalie died on August 17, 1711, which is

        later than Sokol z Lamberka." The NO is based on a clear difference in dates,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Hans Jeschonnek died later (in 1943) than Jan Sokol
        z Lamberka (who died between 1428-1437). The model is directly answering the

        to the question "Did Remer die earlier than Stella?" The model clearly provides
        a comparative result, determining that Remer did not die earlier than Stella
        (because it found that Remer died in 1997 while Stella died in 1657, making

      explanation_equal_values: The model states "They died on the same day" and concludes
        "Therefore, Rowley did not die at an earlier date." The NO answer is directly
        based on the equality of their death dates (both being February 26, 1790),
        making equality the primary reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates of Sir Joshua Rowley (March 26, 1813) and
        John IV, Landgrave of Leuchtenberg (February 21, 1814), concluding that 1813

        equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that "1813 is later than 1414"
        - indicating a clear difference between the death dates. The model is saying
        NO because Sir Joshua Rowley died later (not earlier) than John IV, not because
        they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Did Sir Joshua Rowley die earlier than John IV?" The model
        clearly indicates that Sir Joshua Rowley (died 1813) did not die earlier than
        John IV (died 1414), as 1813 is later than 1414.

        The model's NO answer is based on this difference (Mehmed I died later, not
        earlier than Benjamin of Tudela), not on any equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in Step 4 when answering "Did Mehmed I die at an earlier date than Benjamin

        model's reasoning is that Alexander VI died at a later date (1503) than Svein
        Knutsson (1014), not that they died on the same date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Did Alexander VI die at an earlier date than Svein Knutsson?"
        The model determined that Alexander VI died in 1503 while Svein Knutsson died
        in 1014, and concluded that 1503 is later than 1014, leading to the explicit
        "NO" answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "1503 is later than 1014," indicating
        a difference between the dates. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the dates are different (1503
        vs 1014) and that "1503 is later than 1014." The NO answer is based on this
        difference in dates, not on any equality between them.
