      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Marianus III died in 1375 while Conrad died in 1157, and concluded that
        "1375 is later than 1157" - indicating a difference in values, not equality.
        The model explicitly states that "Marianus III died later, not earlier than
        Conrad."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Marianus III did
        not die at an earlier date than Conrad)" as its final answer. This is a clear
        negative response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that the dates were different (1321 vs 1157) and that the relationship was
        the opposite of what was asked (Marianus III died later, not earlier than
        Conrad).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Marianus III died in
        1321 while Conrad died in 1157, and concluded that since 1321 comes after
        1157, Marianus III did not die at an earlier date than Conrad.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Robert died in 1245 and Eilika died in 1059, which means Robert died
        later, not earlier. The model explicitly states the dates are different (1245
        vs 1059) and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Robert de Brus died
        in 1245 while Eilika of Schweinfurt died in 1059, and since 1245 is later
        than 1059, it concluded that Robert did not die at an earlier date than Eilika.

        that the dates were different (652 CE vs 65 CE), with Abdur Rahman bin Awf
        dying later than Poppaea Sabina. The model explicitly states "652 CE is later
        than 65 CE" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Abdur Rahman bin Awf died before Poppaea Sabina.
        The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining that Abdur Rahman
        bin Awf died in 652 CE, which is later than Poppaea Sabina's death in 65 CE.

        difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Johannes Crellius died earlier than Marie of Valois,
        Duchess of Calabria. The model determined that Crellius died in 1633 while
        Marie died in 1331, and concluded "Therefore Crellius died later, not earlier
        than Marie of Valois" followed by "NO".

        Mikhailovich." The NO answer appears to be in response to a question asking
        if Rostislav died later than Guillaume (though we don't see the original question).
        The model is not saying NO because the values are the same, but because one
        value is greater than the other.

        values being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the
        dates are different (1588 vs 1414) and that Philip II died later than Stephan
        II, not earlier. The model is rejecting the comparison direction, not claiming
        the dates are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly concludes that the statement "Philip II died at an earlier date
        than Stephan II" is false, after determining that Philip II died in 1588 while
        Stephan II died in 1414, meaning Philip II died later, not earlier.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that the dates are different (1545 vs 981) and that their relationship is
        the opposite of what was asked (Festa died later than al-Khushani, not earlier).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Festa died in 1545
        while al-Khushani died in 981, and concluded that since Festa died later (not
        earlier) than al-Khushani, the answer is NO.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Hilary of Poitiers died in 367 CE while Abbas Ibn Firnas died in 887
        CE, meaning Hilary died before Ibn Firnas, not the other way around. The model
        explicitly states "Hilary of Poitiers (367 CE) died before Abbas Ibn Firnas
        (887 CE)" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Ibn Firnas did not die earlier than Hilary of Poitiers. This
        is a direct answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that the values are different and in the opposite direction of what was asked
        (1772 is later than 1360, meaning Nitschmann died after de Lisle, not earlier).
        The model explicitly states the values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that the dates were different, with Nitschmann dying in 1772 and de Lisle
        dying in 1360. The model explicitly states "Nitschmann died later, not earlier
        than de Lisle" as the reason for its NO answer, indicating a difference in
        values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model was asked if David Nitschmann der Bischof
        died earlier than Gerard de Lisle, and it explicitly concluded with "NO" after

        (death dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Yu Cong died in
        665 CE and Sigebert III died in 656 CE, and concludes that Yu Cong died later
        than Sigebert III (not earlier). The NO answer is based on a difference in
        values (665 CE vs 656 CE), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that the answer to the original comparative question

        the question about equal values does not apply. The model did not give a NO
        answer at all, but instead refused to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I must abstain from giving
        a YES/NO answer" and explains that it cannot make a reliable determination
        due to uncertainty about Yu Cong's death date. This is a clear refusal to

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are equal. Instead, it gave NO because it determined that Normann
        died in 1939 while Douglas died in 1714, meaning Normann died later (not earlier)
        than Douglas. The model is noting a difference in values (1939 vs 1714), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and clarifies that "Wilhelm Normann did not die at an earlier date than James
        Douglas, 3rd Marquess of Queensberry." This is a clear negative comparative
        result.

        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly indicates that "Wilhelm Normann

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that the dates were different (1575 vs 1038) and that the relationship was
        the opposite of what was asked (Psaume died later, not earlier than Stephen
        I). The model explicitly states the values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Nicolas Psaume died
        in 1575 while Stephen I of Hungary died in 1038, and concluded that since
        Psaume died later (not earlier), the answer is "NO" to the question of whether
        Psaume died at an earlier date than Stephen I.

        that Christian Ulrich I died later (1704) than John of Arkel (1378), which
        is the opposite of what was asked (if Christian Ulrich I died earlier). The
        model explicitly states the dates are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Christian Ulrich I died at an earlier date than
        John of Arkel. The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after reasoning that
        Christian Ulrich I died in 1704, which is later than John of Arkel's death
        in 1378.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether von Knobelsdorff died at an earlier date than Adam
        de Darlington. The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after reasoning that
        von Knobelsdorff died in 1753 which is later than Adam de Darlington's death
        in 1296.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that von Knobelsdorff died in 1753 while de Darlington died in 1296, and concluded
        that 1753 is later than 1296, meaning von Knobelsdorff died later, not earlier
        than de Darlington. The model identified a clear difference in values (1753
        vs 1296).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether von Knobelsdorff died earlier than de Darlington.

        that the chronological order was opposite to what was asked (Alexander VI
        died in 1503 which is later than Svein Knutsson who died in 1014). The model
        explicitly states the values are different (1503 vs 1014) and this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Alexander VI died earlier than Svein Knutsson.
        The model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining that Alexander VI died
        in 1503 CE while Svein Knutsson died in 1014 CE, and since 1503 comes after
        1014 chronologically, Alexander VI died later, not earlier.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Alexander VI died in 1503 CE while Svein Knutsson died in 1014 CE, meaning
        Alexander VI died later (not earlier) than Svein Knutsson. The model explicitly
        states the dates are different (1503 vs 1014) and uses this difference as
        the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Alexander VI died earlier than Svein Knutsson.
        The model clearly concludes with "Therefore, Alexander VI died later than
        Svein Knutsson, not earlier" followed by "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (death dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that the dates are different
        (1503 vs 1014) and that Alexander VI died later than Svein Knutsson, not earlier.
        The NO answer is based on this chronological difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model is clearly indicating that Alexander
        VI did not die earlier than Svein Knutsson (in fact, it states Alexander VI
        died later).

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Alexander VI
        died approximately 489 years AFTER Svein Knutsson, indicating a clear difference
        in values (1503 vs 1014). The NO answer was given because Alexander VI died
        later, not earlier, than Svein Knutsson.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, clearly indicating that Alexander VI did NOT die at an earlier

        that Alexander VI died later (1503) than Svein Knutsson (1014), not earlier
        as the question asked. The model explicitly noted a difference in the dates
        (1503 vs 1014), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Alexander VI died at an earlier date than Svein
        Knutsson. The model determined that Alexander VI died in 1503 while Svein
        Knutsson died in 1014, and concluded that since 1503 is later than 1014, the
        answer is "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that the opposite of the comparison is true - Alexander VI died later (in
        1503), not earlier, than Svein Knutsson (who died in 1014).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Alexander VI died earlier than Svein Knutsson.
        The model explains that Alexander VI died in 1503 while Svein Knutsson died
        in 1014, and since 1503 comes after 1014, Alexander VI died later, not earlier.

        (death dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that "1503 comes after
        1014" and "Alexander VI died later than Svein Knutsson," indicating a difference
        in values. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Alexander VI did
        not die at an earlier date than Svein Knutsson)" as its final answer. This
        is a clear NO response to the comparative question.
