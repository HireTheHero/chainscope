        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Marianus III died in 1376 and
        Conrad died in 1157, and concludes that "Since 1376 is later than 1157, Marianus
        III died at a later date than Conrad, not earlier." The NO answer is based
        on the fact that one date is later than the other, not that they are equal.

        before Johannes. The NO answer is based on the fact that Marie died earlier,
        not Johannes, rather than any equality between dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Johannes Crellius did not die at an earlier date
        than Marie of Valois. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

        that Marie of Valois died in 1332 while Johannes Crellius died in 1633, meaning
        Marie died before Johannes, not after him. The model explicitly states "Marie
        of Valois died about 300 years before Johannes Crellius was even born" as
        the reason for its NO answer, indicating a clear difference in values, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Johannes Crellius died at an earlier date than Marie of Valois.
        The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, Johannes Crellius did NOT
        die at an earlier date than Marie of Valois" and ends with a clear "NO" at
        the very end of its response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that the death dates were different (2000 vs 1436), with Paolo da Firenze
        dying earlier than Carl Barks, not the other way around. The model explicitly
        states this difference of "approximately 564 years" between their death dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the death dates of Carl Barks (2000) and Paolo da
        Firenze (1436). The model clearly concludes that "Carl Barks did NOT die at

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that the dates
        are different, with Berengar I dying around 1125 and Lorenzo Salimbeni dying
        around 1420-1430, approximately 300 years later. The model concludes NO because
        Berengar I died before Lorenzo Salimbeni, not the other way around.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that Lorenzo Salimbeni did NOT die at an earlier date
        than Berengar I, after determining that Berengar I died in 1125 while Lorenzo
        Salimbeni died around 1420-1430.

        date, not an earlier date, than Constance of Babenberg." The model even specifies
        the difference as "approximately 541 years." The NO is because the comparison
        is in the opposite direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly indicates that Abraham Trembley did NOT die at an earlier
        date than Constance of Babenberg, providing specific dates (1784 vs 1243)

      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was NO, but this was not
        because the values being compared are the same. The model explicitly states
        that Jakob Ernst died in 1698 while Francesco III died in 1612, showing a
        clear difference in dates. The model's reasoning for the NO answer was that
        Jakob Ernst died at a later date (1698) than Francesco III (1612), not because
        they died on the same date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model concludes that Jakob Ernst von

        that Muhammad al-Khushani died in 971 CE while Costanzo Festa died in 1545
        CE, meaning Muhammad al-Khushani died earlier than Costanzo Festa (the opposite
        of what was asked). The model explicitly states "Muhammad al-Khushani died
        earlier than Costanzo Festa, not the other way around." This indicates a difference
        in values, not equality.

        states the dates are different (1150 vs. 1393-1394) and notes they occurred
        about 243 years apart.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Did Guillaume de Harsigny die at an earlier date than Roger
        I Trencavel?" The model clearly concludes that Roger I Trencavel died earlier
        (in 1150) than Guillaume de Harsigny (in 1393-1394).

        reasoning that Joaquim de Siena likely died before 1617, which would mean
        Alonso de Ribera died later, not earlier. The model is making a comparison
        where one value comes before the other, not stating they are equal.

        different (with Remer dying later), not on them being the same.

        vs 1378) and states "John of Arkel died 326 years earlier than Christian Ulrich
        I." The NO answer is based on the fact that Christian Ulrich I died later,
        not earlier, than John of Arkel.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Christian Ulrich I

        Ulrich I died in 1704 while John of Arkel died in the 14th century (either
        1378 or 1396), and concludes that "Christian Ulrich I died at a later date
        than John of Arkel, not earlier." The NO is based on a clear difference in
        dates, not equality.

        and John of Arkel died in 1378, and concludes that "1704 comes after 1378,
        so Christian Ulrich I died at a later date than John of Arkel." The NO answer
        is based on a clear difference in values (Christian died later, not earlier),

        John of Arkel dying in 1378 and Christian Ulrich I dying in 1704, a difference
        of 326 years. The NO answer is based on the fact that John of Arkel died earlier

        years before Christian Ulrich I." The NO answer was given because Christian
        Ulrich I died later, not earlier, than John of Arkel.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Christian Ulrich I

        are different (1629 vs 1560) and uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion.
        The model's reasoning is that Gijsbert died first (in 1560), which is why
        Filippo (who died in 1629) did not die at an earlier date.

        1560 for Gijsbert) and concludes that since 1560 comes before 1629, Gijsbert
        died first, meaning Filippo did not die at an earlier date.

        Wilhelm Voigt (1922). The model concludes that since 2016 comes after 1922,
        Selten did not die at an earlier date than Voigt.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (death dates)
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Johann Karl Wilhelm Voigt died
        in 1821 and Reinhard Selten died in 2016, noting that "Johann Karl Wilhelm
        Voigt died about 195 years earlier than Reinhard Selten." The NO answer is
        based on the fact that the dates are different, with Voigt dying earlier than
        Selten, not because they died on the same date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Reinhard Selten
        did not die at an earlier date than Johann Karl Wilhelm Voigt. It was the
        opposite." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        not die at an earlier date than Johann Karl Wilhelm Voigt." The NO answer
        is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Reinhard Selten died at an earlier date than Johann
        Karl Wilhelm Voigt. The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after comparing
        the death dates.
