      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly states that Conrad died in 1157 while Marianus died in
        1376, and concludes that "1157 is much earlier than 1376." The model is saying
        NO because Conrad died earlier than Marianus, not because they died at the
        same time.

        for Marianus III vs 1157 for Conrad) and concludes that "Conrad, Margrave
        of Meissen, died at an earlier date than Marianus III of Arborea." However,

        died in 1376, and that "1156 is much earlier than 1376." The model's NO answer
        is based on the fact that Conrad died earlier than Marianus, not that they
        died on the same date.

        to the question "Did Marianus III of Arborea die at an earlier date than Conrad,
        Margrave of Meissen?" The model clearly provides a comparative result with
        a definitive NO.

        values being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        Eilika died in 1059 which is "much earlier than 1304" when Robert died. The
        model clearly identifies a difference in the dates of death, not equality.

        to the question "Did Robert de Brus, 4th Lord of Annandale die at an earlier
        date than Eilika of Schweinfurt?" The model clearly concludes that Eilika
        died earlier (in 1059) than Robert (around 1304), and therefore answers NO
        to the comparative question.

        years for their deaths (1059 for Eilika vs. 1245 for Robert). The NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (death dates)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Muhammad al-Khushani likely
        died earlier than Costanzo Festa, with al-Khushani living in the 11th century
        and Festa dying in the 16th century. The NO answer is based on this temporal
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Did Costanzo Festa die at an earlier date than Muhammad al-Khushani?"
        The model provides reasoning that Costanzo Festa died in 1545 (16th century)
        while Muhammad al-Khushani lived in the 11th century, concluding that Muhammad
        al-Khushani died earlier than Festa.

        that the dates are different (1093 vs 1390) and that Amatus died earlier than
        Rupert, not the other way around. The model explicitly states "Since 1093

        that Alexander VI died in 1503 while Svein Knutsson died in 1102, which means
        Alexander VI died later, not earlier. The model explicitly states "Since 1102
        is indeed earlier than 1503, we can conclude that Alexander VI died at a later
        date than Svein Knutsson." This indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Did Alexander VI die at an earlier date than Svein Knutsson?"
        The model clearly concludes that Alexander VI died later (in 1503) than Svein
        Knutsson (who died in 1102).

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Svein Knutsson died at an earlier date than Alexander
        VI.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the death dates are
        equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes Svein Knutsson
        died before Alexander VI ("Svein Knutsson's exact death date is not well-documented,
        but it's safe to assume it was before 1503" and "Since Svein Knutsson lived
        in the 13th century and died before 1503, he died at an earlier date than
        Alexander VI"). The model is indicating a difference in death dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to whether Alexander VI died at an earlier date than Svein Knutsson is: **NO**"
        as its final conclusion.'
