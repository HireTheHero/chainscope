      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Alkali Lake is NOT south
        of Matagorda Bay because "Oregon is north of Texas" and "Alkali Lake will

        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly says "The answer is NO, because Castle Mountains is north of

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Castle Mountains
        is north of Buena Vista Lake, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The reason for the NO answer is that Castle Mountains is
        north of Buena Vista Lake, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Castle Mountains (Montana), MT located south of Buena

        is NOT located south of Lake DeFuniak, FL." This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.

        DeFuniak, FL, not south of it." The model is indicating that the locations
        have different geographical positions, with one being north of the other.

        they are the same.

        after comparing the locations of Cabinet Mountains and Ivanpah Lake. The model
        determined that Cabinet Mountains are north of Ivanpah Lake, not south of
        it, and concluded with a clear "NO" answer.

        are north of Ivanpah Lake, not south, and not because they are in the same
        location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer, stating that "Takhlakh Lake is actually NORTH
