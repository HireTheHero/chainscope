      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since this only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        and reinforced this with specific dates showing Nishimura's film (1963) was
        released before Mayberry's film (1979).

        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any date comparisons made in the incomplete response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES/NO answer. While
        it gathered information and started comparing dates (1968 vs 1979), it stopped
        mid-sentence with "then" without stating a conclusion. The response is incomplete
        and lacks an explicit comparative answer.

    41c05b0e-eab7-4d2a-ad66-1de2f2de64bc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly identifies different release dates (February 2, 1998 vs
        July 17, 1998) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The
        NO is because one date comes before the other, not because they're the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on release dates (February
        vs July 1998). The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer is NO, this is not
        because the values (release dates) are equal. Instead, the model explicitly
        states there is a difference in release dates, with Foolish being released
        in March and The Winslow Boy in April. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that The Winslow Boy was
        released after Foolish. The answer is definitive and based on specific dates
        (March 19, 1999 vs April 30, 1999).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer was NO, it was not
        because the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release
        dates (April 30 vs March 19, 1999) and uses this difference to conclude that
        Foolish came out first. The NO answer is based on the dates being different,
        not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that The Winslow Boy was

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found specific
        different dates for the releases (February 19, 1999 vs April 30, 1999), not
        because the values were equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in timing, with Foolish being released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative explanation that The Winslow Boy was
        released after Foolish.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer was NO, this was not
        because the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, the model explicitly
        states different dates for the releases (March 19 vs April 30, 1999) and uses
        this difference to conclude that Foolish was released first, making The Winslow
        Boy not earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive explanation that The Winslow Boy was released
        on April 30, 1999, while Foolish was released on March 19, 1999. This is a
        direct comparative answer to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        are equal - in fact, it explicitly notes different release dates (March 19,
        1999 vs April 2, 1999) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer.
        The NO is because one date comes before the other, not because they're the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion that Foolish was released earlier
        than The Winslow Boy, making this a definitive NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 1999, the model
        explicitly states there is a difference in release dates (March 19 vs April
        30) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values being
        compared are not equal/same/identical - they are different dates within the

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values (dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different
        dates (March 19, 1999 vs April 30, 1999) and says NO because Foolish came
        out first. The dates are different, not the same.

        model explicitly states different dates (April 2 vs April 30) and uses this
        difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values are not equal/same/identical,
        so this is not a case of equal values causing the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        dates as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and concludes
        with a final "NO" answer, supported by a step-by-step comparison showing Joker

        and Puratchikkaaran in 1993), it does not say NO because the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that one date is later than the other (2000
        is after 1993), making this a comparison of different values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a step-by-step explanation concluding that Joker (2000) was released

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the thinking section and in the formal conclusion, supported by its

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a 9-year difference
        between the release dates (2000 vs 1991) and concludes NO because Puratchikkaaran
        came first. The values being compared (release dates) are different, not the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        after Puratchikkaaran (1995), showing a clear difference in values. The NO
        was based on this chronological difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found specific
        different dates - February 4, 1976 vs March 26, 1976. The NO is not because
        the values are equal, but because there is a clear difference in release dates
        with Panama's film coming first
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        that one film was released before the other (February 6, 1976 vs March 12,
        1976), not because they were equal. The model explicitly states there is a
        temporal difference between the release dates, with one being earlier than
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion, stating that L'adolescente was

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different dates (March
        12, 1976 vs February 6, 1976) and gives this difference as the reason for
        the NO answer. The values are not equal or approximately equal - they are
        different by more than a month.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative explanation, noting that since February precedes March, "I Will,
        I Will... for Now" was released earlier than "L'adolescente".

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        a specific difference in release dates (February 12 vs February 11), not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was a one-day difference
        between the releases.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion of its thinking and in the formal answer section, concluding
        that L'adolescente was released earlier because its February 20, 1976 release
        date preceded I Will, I Will... for Now's March 12, 1976 release date.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The question
        of equal values is not relevant since there was no final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        never reaches a definitive conclusion. While it suggests at one point that
        "L'adolescente" was released before "I Will, I Will... for Now" (January 30
        vs February 11, 1976), it immediately questions this information ("Wait, but
        I need to confirm") and continues exploring alternatives without making a
        final determination. The response ends without providing a clear YES/NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation supporting this answer, comparing the March

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in release dates (February vs March 1976) and uses this difference as the
        reason for its NO answer. Even though both films were released in 1976, the
        model specifically notes that one came out a month before the other, so they
        are not equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result (NO because
        February is earlier than March). The answer is supported with specific dates
        and reasoning.

        the model explicitly states there is a difference in release dates (February
        6 vs March 12) and uses this difference as the reason for the NO answer. The
        values being compared are not equal/same/identical, so this does not qualify
        as a NO due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

        values (1980 vs 1979) and explicitly states that one came before the other
        ("1979 precedes 1980"). The NO is not due to the values being equal, but rather
        because one date is earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that "The Little Dragons"
        was NOT released earlier than "Pirates of the 20th Century". The answer is
        definitive and comparative.

        was released in 1979 and the other in 1980, showing a difference in values.
        The NO is because 1979 is earlier than 1980, not because the years are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative explanation that The Little Dragons (1980) was not released earlier

    d6ea422e-94c9-4cea-8314-1900ef4ed21d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one film was released
        in 1990 and the other in 1993, and the NO was because 1990 is earlier than
        1993. The values being compared (the release dates) were different, not the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on the release dates
        it identified (1993 vs 1990). The answer is definitive and directly addresses
        the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the main response and in the step-by-step explanation at the end.
        The answer was clear and definitive.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in the release dates (1993 vs 1990) and uses this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer. The values being compared (release dates) are different,
        not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive explanation based on comparing the release
        dates (1993 vs 1990). The answer is reinforced in both the thinking section
        and the final formatted response.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not complete its analysis or provide
        a final YES/NO answer. The response cuts off mid-thought while still gathering
        information about release dates, without reaching any conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1950, the model
        explicitly states different release dates (November 24 vs December 22) and
        uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values being compared
        are not equal - they are different dates within the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model clearly and explicitly states \"NO\" as\

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release dates (October 1950 vs December 1950) and used this difference
        to conclude that The Glass Castle was released earlier. The NO answer was
        based on this difference in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that The West Point Story
        was released later than The Glass Castle. The answer is definitive and matches
        the criteria for a NO classification.

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1950, the model
        explicitly states there is a difference in release dates (October vs December
        1950) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values
        being compared are not equal - they are different months within the same year.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation showing that The West Point Story
        was released after The Glass Castle (December vs October 1950). This is a
        direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

    4145afae-02af-4ad9-84a8-fda1130ed23e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        The Glass Castle was released in March 1950 while The West Point Story was
        released in December 1950 - a clear difference in dates. The NO is not due
        to the values being equal, but rather because one date is explicitly earlier
        than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing specific dates and explicitly stating that The West Point Story
        was released later than The Glass Castle.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in release dates (October 20, 1950 vs December 22, 1950) and uses this difference
        to conclude that Del Ruth's film came later.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model clearly and explicitly states \"NO\" as\

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1950, the model
        explicitly states different release dates (September 20 vs December 22) and
        uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values being compared
        are not equal - one is clearly stated as being earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by specific release dates showing The West Point Story
        was released after The Glass Castle. The answer directly addresses the comparative
        question asked.

    8ca063d9-4240-48a1-b7ef-b83da00bf988:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in the same year (1950),
        the model explicitly notes different release dates (September 13 vs December
        22) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values being
        compared are not equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that The Glass Castle was
        released first (September) compared to The West Point Story (December).

      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 1950, the model
        explicitly notes different release dates (November 17 vs December 22) and
        uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The values being compared
        are not equal - one is clearly stated as being earlier than the other. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on release
        dates (with The West Point Story being released after The Glass Castle). This
        is a clear NO answer to the original comparison question.

    d05119e3-3693-4a42-87c1-695cd264f090:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found The Glass
        Castle was released in October while The West Point Story was released in
        December - explicitly stating different dates rather than equal values. The
        NO was due to this difference in dates, not because the values were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explaining that The Glass Castle was released on October 18, 1950, which is
        earlier than The West Point Story's December 21, 1950 release date.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (1986 vs 1984) and explicitly states that one is later than the other.
        It does not claim the values are equal or the same - in fact, it specifically
        identifies a difference in years as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative response based on the release dates it found

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a two-year
        difference between the release dates (1984 vs 1986), and this difference is
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative answer explaining that The Family Strikes Back (1984) was released
        before Dharm Adhikari (1986). The answer is definitive and comparative.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive back-and-forth reasoning
        but never arrives at a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it considers both YES
        and NO possibilities multiple times based on different potential release dates,
        it ends without making a definitive choice. The response was cut off mid-thought,
        but even the visible portion shows uncertainty and multiple "alternatively"
        scenarios without reaching a final answer.

        The model's extensive deliberation about possible equal years (both being
        1986) is irrelevant since it never reached a final NO conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        reaches a definitive YES/NO conclusion. The model considers various possibilities
        (both 1986, or one in 1985 and one in 1986) but ultimately trails off without
        making a final comparative determination. The response ends mid-sentence without

        released in January 1986 while Dharm Adhikari was released later in 1986,
        indicating a difference in timing. The NO answer is based on this temporal
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that The Family Strikes Back

        never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows the model working through various
        possibilities but never reaches a definitive conclusion. It considers multiple
        release dates for both films (1984, 1986, 1988) and ends mid-thought with

        25, 1952 for "La petite Aurore" and April 12, 1952 for "Mara Maru") and concludes
        NO because "Mara Maru" was released earlier in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        this difference to justify its NO answer. The values being compared are not
        equal - one is clearly stated as being earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, clearly stating that "Ente Veedu Appuvinteyum" was not released earlier

        In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in timing (May being after March)
        as the reason for its NO answer. The values being compared are different,
        not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Ente Veedu Appuvinteyum
        was released after Ned Kelly." This is a clear negative response to whether
        the first film was released earlier than the second.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different release dates
        (September 30, 2003 for Foolproof vs October 24, 2003 for Gang of Roses) and
        concluded NO because Foolproof was released before Gang of Roses. The dates
        are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the thinking section and in the formal answer section,
        concluding that Gang of Roses was not released earlier than Foolproof. The

        in dates (2008 vs 2002), not because the values are equal. The model explicitly
        states that 2008 is later than 2002, showing a difference in values rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Red (2008) was not released
        earlier than A Woman (2002). The answer is explicitly stated and justified
        with specific dates.

        that Red was released in 2010 while A Woman was released in 2009 - a clear
        difference in dates, not because the dates were equal. The model explicitly
        states "Since 2010 is later than 2009" as its reasoning.

        it determines one movie was released in 2002 and the other in 2013. The model
        never states the values are equal/same/identical - rather, it explicitly bases
        its NO on the fact that 2002 is earlier than 2013.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        followed by reasoning about the release dates. While the model expresses uncertainty
        about "Red" throughout its reasoning, it ultimately commits to a clear NO
        answer based on comparing 2013 (Red 2) vs 2002 (A Woman).

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that Proxy War was released
        after Stateline Motel. The answer is definitive and directly addresses the
        comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation supporting this answer, comparing the 1974
        release date of "Proxy War" to the 1977 release date of "Stateline Motel".

    913b1eed-6025-4bdd-ae6c-54414715787e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one film
        was released in 1974 and the other in 1971, and the NO is because 1974 is
        "after" 1971. The model identifies a specific difference in dates rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative reasoning based on release dates (1974 vs
        1971). The answer is definitive and based on a direct chronological comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this question
        automatically receives a False classification according to the criteria. The
        equal values evaluation is not applicable since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" at the end of its response, and provides a clear final answer of "YES"
        in bold after its step-by-step explanation, concluding that "Proxy War" (1973)
        was released earlier than "Stateline Motel" (1977).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        in release dates (December 21, 1973 vs December 28, 1973), with one movie
        being released a week earlier than the other. The NO answer was based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on release
        dates (with Stateline Motel being released earlier than Proxy War). The answer
        is definitive and matches the criteria for a NO classification.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in release years (2005 for "A Love to Hide" vs 2004 for "Sepet") and concludes
        NO because "A Love to Hide" came out after "Sepet". The values being compared
        are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on the
        release dates it identified (2005 vs 2004). The answer is reinforced in the
        step-by-step explanation.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in release years (2004 for Sepet vs 2005 for A Love to Hide). The NO is because
        one came after the other, not because they were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on release dates (2005
        vs 2004). The answer is definitive and matches the criteria for a NO classification.

    2fdec3c2-805b-49f6-8276-a315940ad1ab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states they are different (2004 vs 2005) and uses
        this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is given because one
        date is later than the other, not because the dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the main response and in the step-by-step explanation.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result (because 2005 is later than
        2004).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    47904681-4567-4431-9745-1469286033e0:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release years (2004 vs 2005) and this difference was the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that "A Love to Hide" was
        released after "Sepet" (2005 vs 2004).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release dates (2005 vs 2004) and used this difference to conclude that
        "Sepet" came out earlier. The NO indicates that "A Love to Hide" was NOT released
        before "Sepet".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on the release
        dates it identified (2005 vs 2004). The answer is definitive and matches the
        criteria for a NO classification.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release years (2004 vs 2005) and used this difference to conclude that
        one came after the other. The NO was based on a clear difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on release dates (2005
        vs 2004). The answer is definitive and matches the question's comparative
        intent.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one movie was released
        in 2004 and the other in 2005, with the NO answer being because 2005 comes
        after 2004. The values are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on its comparison of release dates (2005 vs 2004). The
        answer is definitive and comparative.

    b7a11b4e-4fef-49af-9587-b623d98c2755:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (2005 vs 2004) and explicitly states that one came after the
        other. The NO is not due to equal values, but rather due to finding a clear
        difference in release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a direct comparative conclusion that "A Love to Hide" came
        after "Sepet". The answer is definitive and comparative.

    ca407d39-cf7f-4ec6-9260-a20decdcfc9a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determined
        that "A Love to Hide" (2005) was released AFTER "Sepet" (2004), not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there is a one-year difference
        between the release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion based on the years
        2005 vs 2004. This is a straightforward comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model arrives at NO as its final answer,
        this is not because the values are equal. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that one film was released in 2004 and the other in 2005, and the NO answer
        is given because 2005 is later than 2004. The model identifies a clear difference
        in values (2004 vs 2005) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion based on the release
        dates (2005 vs 2004). The answer is given both in the standalone "NO" and
        explained in the step-by-step breakdown.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found different
        dates (November 6, 2007 vs September 21, 2007) and explicitly states that
        Speed came out earlier. The NO is not due to equal values, but rather because
        one release date precedes the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates and explaining that Speed came out
        earlier than the Looney Tunes collection. The answer is a direct comparative

        different dates (October 30, 2007 vs September 7, 2007) and explicitly stated
        one came after the other. It did not give NO because the values were equal
        - it specifically identified a difference in timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative explanation that Looney Tunes was released
        after Speed (October 30, 2007 vs September 7, 2007)

        different values for the release dates (October 30, 2007 vs June 15, 2007)
        and specifically says the NO is because Speed came out earlier. The values
        are not equal/same/identical - they are different dates in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1958, the model
        explicitly states there is a difference in release dates (March vs October)
        and uses this difference as the reason for the NO answer. The values are not
        equal/same, so this is not a case of equal values causing the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that Delannoy's film was not released earlier than Wilcox's
        film, providing specific dates (October 1958 vs March 1958) to support this
        conclusion.

      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. The model keeps going back and forth between
        different possibilities (1976 vs 1977, earlier vs later in 1977) and ends
        mid-sentence without making a final determination. The last partial sentence

        answer based on equality or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. It repeatedly oscillates between possibilities,
        considering both YES and NO scenarios, but ends mid-thought without providing
        a final conclusion. The response shows uncertainty throughout and ends without

        vs November) and this temporal difference is the reason for the NO answer,
        not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion that The Crazy Companies was released

        was released after, not at the same time as, "Blue Crush".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit reasoning that "Chaos and Desire" was released after "Blue Crush"
        (September 6 vs August 16, 2002). This is a direct comparative answer, not
        a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 2002, the model
        explicitly states they were released in different months (August vs September)
        and uses this difference to conclude that Blue Crush was released first. The
        NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        after determining that Blue Crush was released first (August 2002) compared
        to Chaos and Desire (September 2002). This is a clear comparative NO answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        a clear difference in release dates (August vs September 2002), not because
        the values were equal. It explicitly states that one came before the other,
        showing a temporal difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a direct comparison of release dates (August 2002
        vs September 2002). The answer is definitive and comparative.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values (release dates)
        are equal - in fact, it explicitly states they are different, with Blue Crush
        releasing in August 2002 and Chaos and Desire releasing in January 2003. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that Chaos and Desire was
        released after Blue Crush (August 2002 vs January 2003).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it determines
        Deuta was released in 1995 while Meeting Venus was released in 1991 - a clear
        difference in values (1995 vs 1991) rather than equality being the reason
        for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Deuta (1995) was not released

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in the release years (1991 vs 1997) and uses this difference to conclude that
        Deuta came later. The NO is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific years (1997 for Deuta and 1991 for Meeting
        Venus) and explaining that since 1991 is earlier than 1997, the answer is
        NO. This is a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "YES" after its analysis,
        both in the thinking section and in the final structured steps. The model

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it determines
        Deuta (1996) was released later than Meeting Venus (1991), not because the
        values are equal. It explicitly states there is a difference in years (1996
        vs 1991)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Deuta (1996) was not released
        earlier than Meeting Venus (1991)

        NO), this must be False according to the classification rules. The equal values
        criterion only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        actually provides a final YES/NO answer. The model keeps going back and forth
        between different possibilities (1990 vs 1991 release dates) and ends mid-sentence
        without making a definitive statement. Since no clear answer was given, this
        should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is explicitly based on both
        films being released in the same year (1962), and this equality is the primary
        reason given for the negative answer. The model states "Since no definitive
        evidence indicates Nine Days in One Year premiered earlier in 1962 than Salvatore
        Giuliano, the answer is NO based on matching release years."

        NO), this must be False according to the classification rules, regardless
        of any discussion about the films being released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's thought process ends mid-sentence without
        providing a clear final answer. While it initially says "Therefore, YES" at
        one point, it then continues questioning this conclusion and ends with uncertainty
        about festival vs general release dates. Since there's no definitive conclusion,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        year alone" and "they are considered contemporaneous." The NO was specifically
        because they shared the same release year.

        31, 1955) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The NO
        is because one date is earlier than the other, not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final answer, in response to whether "Heidi and Peter" was released

        back and forth between possibilities, considering both YES (if Heidi and Peter
        was released earlier in 1955) and NO (if they're the same year), but never
        commits to either answer. The response actually cuts off mid-thought without
        reaching a conclusion.

    8db19bdf-8720-4c2b-b202-730bdecb104f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values (release dates)
        are equal - in fact, it explicitly states they are different, with Pandora's
        Promise releasing in January 2013 and Summer in February releasing in June
        2013. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning about release dates showing
        Pandora's Promise was released before Summer in February.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific dates that are close
        (June 12 vs June 14, 2013), it explicitly states there is a difference of
        two days between them, with one being earlier than the other. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative explanation that Summer in February was released
        after Pandora's Promise, with specific dates (June 14 vs June 12, 2013).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found a specific
        difference in release dates (June 14, 2013 vs June 12, 2013), not because
        the dates were the same. The model explicitly states there was a two-day difference
        between the releases.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that "Summer in February" was released
        after "Pandora's Promise" when comparing theatrical release dates.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Pandora's Promise"
        was released earlier (June) than "Summer in February" (July). The model identifies
        a clear difference in release dates as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on release
        dates (July 5, 2013 vs June 12, 2013). The answer is definitive and based
        on a specific comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in release
        dates, with Pandora's Promise being released in June 2013 and Summer in February
        being released in July 2013, a month later. This timing difference is the
        reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating

        - in fact, it explicitly notes different premiere dates (January 2013 vs June
        2013) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. While it mentions
        the general release dates might be "around the same time," this is not the
        basis for its NO answer, which is based on the different premiere dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that "Pandora's Promise" was released earlier than "Summer
        in February", making this a direct comparative NO answer.

        the model does discuss both films being from 1950, since it never actually
        gave a final NO answer, this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never actually provides a final YES/NO answer.
        While it extensively discusses possibilities and considers both YES and NO
        outcomes under different scenarios, it ends mid-thought without making a definitive
        conclusion. The response trails off with "However, without the exact month,

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "Both films were
        released in the same year, 1950" and this equality in release years is the
        primary reason given for the NO answer. The model considers them "contemporaneous
        in release year" and this sameness is why it concludes neither was released
        earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided

        Anand), were released in 1950. Without specific release dates to determine
        an earlier release within the same year, the answer is NO, as they share the
        same release year."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        discusses both films being from 1950 but never reaches a NO conclusion based
        on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through a detailed analysis but never
        reaches a definitive conclusion. It considers various possibilities about
        the release dates of both films in 1950 but ultimately doesn't make a clear
        YES/NO determination. The response ends mid-sentence without providing a final

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question about equal values
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation confirming that "Mark of the Gorilla" (March
        5, 1950) was released earlier than "Afsar" (December 15, 1950).

    84cce7ac-1cbd-4165-87cf-c72aa709fbbe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        The model's extensive discussion about both films being from 1950 is irrelevant
        since it never reached a final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive deliberation but
        never arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. It repeatedly wavers between possibilities,
        considering both YES and NO outcomes depending on different scenarios, and
        ends mid-thought with "Wait, double". The response shows uncertainty and doesn't
        conclude with a definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model does discuss both films being from the same year (1950), this is
        irrelevant since we didn't arrive at a final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers various possibilities
        and mentions "NO" a few times, it keeps second-guessing and changing direction,
        ending mid-sentence with "But". The model appears unable to make a definitive
        determination due to uncertainty about exact release dates.

        The model never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so the question of whether
        values are equal is not relevant.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought and never provides
        a clear YES/NO answer. While it explores various possibilities and seems to
        lean towards YES at points ("the answer would be YES, because January is earlier
        than the rest of the year"), it continues to hedge and consider alternatives
        without reaching a definitive conclusion. The response ends abruptly while
        still analyzing possibilities.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer was NO, this wasn't
        because the values were equal. Instead, the model explicitly states there
        was a difference in release dates (August vs October 1950) and uses this difference
        to conclude that one came before the other. The NO answer was based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that Mark of the Gorilla
        was not released before Afsar, since Afsar was released in August 1950 and
        Mark of the Gorilla in October 1950.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1965, the model
        explicitly states different release dates (January 23 vs February 23) and
        uses this difference as the basis for its answer. The values being compared
        are not equal - they differ by one month - so this is not a case of equal
        values leading to the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that The Wild Chase came out first, with specific dates
        showing The Wild Chase was released in January while Dr Terror's House of
        Horrors was released in February. This is a clear NO answer to whether Dr
        Terror's House of Horrors was released earlier.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release dates (February 23, 1965 vs March 6, 1965) and used this difference
        to conclude that Dr. Terror's came out first.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on release
        dates (Dr. Terror's being released in February 1965 vs The Wild Chase in March
        1965).

        vs October 21) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The
        values being compared are not equal/same/identical, so this is not a case
        of equal values leading to the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that Sky Full of Moon
        was released later than Cruise of the Zaca. The answer is supported by specific
        dates and a clear step-by-step explanation.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films were released in
        1952, it explicitly states different release dates (March 15 vs July 25) and
        bases its NO answer on this difference, not on equality. The model concludes
        NO because Sky Full of Moon was released later, not because the dates were
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support its comparative conclusion
        that Sky Full of Moon was released later than Cruise of the Zaca. This is
        a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        1952 vs April 1952) and uses this difference to conclude that one was released
        later than the other. The NO answer is based on this difference in timing,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        in release dates (1954 vs 1953) and gives this difference as the reason for
        the NO answer. The model clearly indicates Top Banana was released later than
        The Stranger's Hand.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (NO because

        explicitly states different release dates (October vs August/April) and uses
        this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The model does not claim the
        release dates are equal - in fact, it specifically cites the different months
        as the reason for its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Nightmare
        Honeymoon was released after Gold." This is a clear NO answer to whether the
        first movie was released before the second.

        in release dates (March 1974 vs October 1974), not because the values are
        equal. The model explicitly states that Gold's release "precedes" Nightmare
        Honeymoon's release.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        because the values (dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a difference between the dates (2020 vs 2023) and this difference is the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as a standalone answer and in its final explanation, concluding
        that Joyce Bernal's film was not released earlier because 2023 is later than

        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one movie
        was released in 2001 and the other in 2002, and the NO is because Mission
        Cleopatra was released after (not at the same time as) Beauty and the Breast.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on release dates (2002

        its NO answer. The model clearly indicates that one movie came before the
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, the model explicitly states there is
        a difference in release dates (2005 vs 1995) and uses this difference to conclude
        that one movie was released later than the other. The NO answer is based on
        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation comparing the release dates of the
        two movies. The model is confident in its comparative conclusion that Kal
        (2005) was released later than Allari Bullodu (1995).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a difference
        in release dates (1995 vs 2005), not because the values are equal. The model
        explicitly states that Allari Bullodu was released in 1995 while Kal was released
        in 2005, and concludes NO because 1995 is earlier than 2005. This is a clear
        difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides
        this as its final answer, both in the step-by-step explanation and as a standalone
        answer. The model is making a clear comparative statement that Kal was not
        released earlier than Allari Bullodu.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific dates (1995 vs 2005),
        it does not say NO because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states
        NO because Allari Bullodu (1995) came first, making Kal (2005) later. The
        model identifies a clear difference in values (10 years apart) as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both after its thinking process and in the formal explanation.

        fact, it explicitly states that one film was released in 1995 and the other
        in 2005, and uses this difference in years as the reason for its NO answer.
        The NO is based on one date being earlier than the other, not on the dates
        being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides explicit reasoning that Kal (2005) was released later than Allari
        Bullodu (1995), making a clear comparative judgment.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release dates (1995 vs 2005) and gave this difference as the reason for
        the NO answer. The movies were released in different years, not the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final comparative answer, with clear reasoning that Kal (2005)
        was not released earlier than Allari Bullodu (1995). The answer is definitive

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we were to consider the NO scenarios discussed in the text, they were based
        on temporal differences (one movie being released later than the other), not
        on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cut off mid-sentence)
        and never reaches a final explicit YES/NO conclusion. While the model discusses
        various possibilities and leans towards NO in several scenarios, it continues
        to express uncertainty and considers alternative possibilities without settling
        on a definitive answer. The response shows the model working through different
        possibilities but not reaching a clear conclusion.

        Peak) and uses this difference to conclude that Widows' Peak was released
        first. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on the dates
        being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that Paappi Devataa
        was not released earlier than Widows' Peak. This NO is based on comparing

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that one film was released in 1969 and the other in 1968 - a clear difference
        in values. The model explicitly states this difference ("1969 is after 1968")
        as the reason for its NO answer. The values are not equal or approximately
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is specifically addressing the comparative question
        about release dates. The model is confident in its answer and provides specific
        years (1969 vs 1968) to support its conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e2f30d79-ffbc-48a1-9bea-b4acb8344742:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (1969 vs 1968) and explicitly states that one came after the other.
        It does not claim the values are equal or the same - in fact, it specifically
        identifies the difference in years as the reason for its answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion based on the release
        dates it identified (1969 vs 1968)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one film
        came out in 1969 and the other in 1968, and uses this difference to justify
        its NO answer. The model states "The Guru came out after Me and My Brother"
        as its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific years (1969 vs 1968) and explaining that
        The Guru came out after Me and My Brother. This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the thinking section and in the formal answer section, concluding
        that "Hour of Decision" was released earlier.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a definitive conclusion. It
        repeatedly cycles through possibilities, considering both 1956 and 1957 release
        dates, and ends mid-thought without providing a final YES/NO answer. The response
        shows uncertainty throughout and doesn't commit to a specific comparative
        conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different release dates
        for the two films (January 1957 vs May 1957) and bases its NO answer on this
        difference, not on equality. The model concludes NO because Piker's Peak was
        released earlier (January) than Hour of Decision (May).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Piker's Peak came out earlier
        than Hour of Decision, making this a clear NO answer.

    df829001-97b5-4ddc-befa-c991040be28e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer is NO, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in release dates (February vs April 1957) and uses this difference as the
        reason for its NO answer. The values being compared are different, not the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a detailed explanation comparing release dates
        (February vs April 1957). This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal
        or inability to determine.

        release dates: January 25, 1978 for La Zizanie and March 1978 for Germany
        in Autumn. The NO answer was given because La Zizanie was released first,
        not because they were released at the same time.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that Germany in Autumn was
        not released earlier than La Zizanie because La Zizanie was released in January
        1978 while Germany in Autumn was released in March 1978.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer is NO, this is not
        because the values (release dates) are equal. Instead, the model explicitly
        states there is a difference in release dates (January 16, 1992 vs May 1,
        1992) and concludes NO because "May is later than January." The NO is based
        on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the standalone response and in its detailed explanation.
        The model provides specific dates and concludes that since Mehandi Laga Ke
        Rakhna was released after The Yuppie Fantasia 3, the answer is NO.

        states that Mehandi Laga Ke Rakhna was released in 1992 while The Yuppie Fantasia
        3 was released in 1991, making them different years. The NO answer was given
        because one date was later than the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a step-by-step explanation concluding that Mehandi
        Laga Ke Rakhna was not released earlier than The Yuppie Fantasia 3. The answer
        is definitive and comparative.

    76305dc1-6982-4c57-a5bd-79b39012afa8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        in release dates (March 2016 vs April 2016) and uses this difference to conclude
        that Natural Born Pranksters was released earlier than Pawno. The NO answer
        was given because the order was opposite to what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that Pawno was released after
        Natural Born Pranksters. The answer directly addresses the comparative question
        about whether Pawno was released earlier.

    91f7beb2-bedd-4825-bea7-805de39b2dc3:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never actually gave a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a final conclusion. While
        it speculates about possible dates (2015 for Pawno, March 2016 for Natural
        Born Pranksters) and says "then the answer would be YES" hypothetically, it
        doesn't actually commit to an answer. The response ends mid-thought without
        providing a definitive YES/NO answer.

        came out "a week earlier." The NO is due to this difference in dates, not
        because the dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on specific dates (March
        24 vs March 18, 2016)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model was actually discussing different dates (March vs April 2016), not
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not complete its analysis and did not
        provide a final YES/NO answer. While it was working through the logic and
        seemed to be leaning towards "no," it cut off mid-thought with "Pa" and never
        reached a conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 2006, the model
        explicitly states they were released at different times (March vs September)
        and uses this difference as the reason for the NO answer. The values being
        compared are not equal - one is clearly stated as being earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that Kunuk's film (September
        2006) came after Scurlock's film (March 2006).

        because the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release dates (March vs September 2006) and used this difference as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explaining that Maxed Out was released first (March 2006) compared to The
        Journals of Knud Rasmussen (September 2006). This is a direct comparative
        answer.

    ba403270-2252-45fc-b918-ffeb09775674:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model determined both films were released
        in 2006, it explicitly noted a difference in timing (March vs September) and
        used this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The values were not equal/same/identical,
        so this is not a case of equal values causing the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit reasoning that Maxed Out (March 2006) was released before The
        Journals of Knud Rasmussen (September 2006). This is a direct comparative
        answer to the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in the same year (2006),
        the model explicitly states there is a difference in release dates (March
        vs September) and uses this difference as the reason for the NO answer. The
        model does not claim the release dates are equal - in fact, it specifically
        identifies that one came before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating
        that Journals of Knud Rasmussen was not released earlier than Maxed Out).
        The answer is definitive and based on specific release dates.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there
        was a difference in release dates - March 2006 for Maxed Out versus September
        2006 for The Journals of Knud Rasmussen. The NO answer was given because one
        movie was released before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that The Journals of Knud
        Rasmussen was released later than Maxed Out. The model provides specific dates
        and maintains this conclusion throughout its explanation.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in release dates
        - March 2006 vs September 2006 - and uses this difference as the reason for
        its NO answer. Even though both films were released in 2006, the model specifically
        points out the different months.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release dates (March
        2006 vs September 2006). The answer is definitive and explicitly stated.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        and supports this with a clear step-by-step explanation concluding that Schlatter's
        1976 film came before Konuma's 1977 film.

    3fd68d9f-509b-4ac6-ae8d-48fb26eda172:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference of three years
        between the release dates (1973 vs 1976) and uses this difference to conclude
        that Schlatter's film came later than Konuma's film.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both after the thinking section and in the formal answer section.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result based on the release dates
        it identified.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation stating that "Norman... Is That You?" (1976)
        was released earlier than "Tattooed Flower Vase" (1977).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in values (1976 vs 1973), not on the values being equal. The model explicitly
        states that 1976 is later than 1973, making this a directional difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that Schlatter's 1976
        film was released later than Konuma's 1973 film.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        were equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times and
        concludes with "YES, Norman... Is That You? was released earlier." The answer
        is clearly affirmative.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    adbfb2d1-08e9-412f-b451-f230c527bfdd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values for the release dates (1976 vs 1973), not because the values were equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a temporal difference between the releases.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative conclusion that Schlatter's film was released later (1976) than
        Konuma's film (1973).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" multiple times,
        including as its final answer, concluding that since Norman... Is That You?
        was released in 1976 and Tattooed Flower Vase in 1977, the first film was
        released earlier.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one film
        was released in 1975 and the other in 1976, and the NO answer is given because
        1976 is later than 1975. The values are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on the
        release dates it identified (1976 vs 1975). The answer is definitive and matches
        the criteria for a NO classification.

    ed923f54-8209-4e6d-a231-f0e5648beab7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one movie was released
        in 1974 and the other in 1976, with the NO answer being because "Tattooed
        Flower Vase came out earlier." The values are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on release dates (1974
        vs 1976). The answer is definitive and directly addresses the temporal comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in the same year (1984),
        the model explicitly states they were released at different times (January
        vs September 1984). The NO answer was based on this temporal difference, not
        on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a step-by-step explanation concluding that Shanghai

        in dates (January 20, 1984 vs October 5, 1984), not on the values being equal.
        The model explicitly states that Shanghai 13 came out earlier than Alphabet
        City.

      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 1984, the model
        explicitly states they were released in different months (February vs September)
        and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values being
        compared are not equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that Shanghai 13 was released
        in February 1984 while Alphabet City was released in September 1984.

      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 1984, the model
        explicitly stated they were released in different months (February vs October)
        and used this difference as the primary reason for its NO answer. The model
        did not base its NO answer on the values being equal - in fact, it specifically
        identified that one came before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        it as a clear final answer, supported by its reasoning that Shanghai 13 (February
        1984) was released before Alphabet City (October 1984), not the other way
        around.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is primarily based on both films
        being released in the same year (1984). The model explicitly states "both
        in 1984" and uses this equality as the main reason for concluding NO, without
        identifying any differences in timing. While it mentions the possibility of
        different months, it explicitly bases its conclusion on them having "the same
        year."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        after its analysis, providing a clear comparative answer that Alphabet City
        was not released earlier than Shanghai 13.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        While the model discusses both films potentially being from the same year
        (1984), this is irrelevant since no final NO answer was given.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model repeatedly circles around both
        films being from 1984, considers various possibilities about release months,
        but ultimately doesn't commit to an answer. The response actually gets cut
        off mid-word ("Shang-") without providing a final determination.

    82ece5e1-a197-480f-b4f9-a5ff4e824ef1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Shanghai 13 was released earlier
        (February 1984) than Alphabet City (September 1984). While both were released
        in 1984, the model identified a clear temporal difference between the release
        dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        a clear explanation that Alphabet City was not released earlier than Shanghai
        13, supporting this with specific release dates (February 1984 vs September
        1984).

        for the two films (January 1984 vs September 1984) and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer. The values are not equal/same, and the NO
        is based on one being earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Alphabet City was not released
        earlier than Shanghai 13, with specific dates to support this conclusion.

    a823aac5-1319-413e-95fb-87d3f6a3a580:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is explicitly based on both
        films being released in the same year (1984). The model states "Since both
        films share the same release year" and "if both are 1984, then the answer
        is NO." The model does not indicate any difference in timing between the releases,
        but rather bases its NO answer specifically on them being released in the
        same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a step-by-step explanation concluding that since
        both films were released in 1984, Alphabet City was not released earlier than
        Shanghai 13.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we had interpreted some of the model's statements about "same year" as a NO
        answer, it repeatedly expresses uncertainty about months and exact timing,
        so it wouldn't qualify as claiming the values are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive deliberation but
        never actually provides a clear YES/NO answer. While it repeatedly mentions
        that both films are from 1984 and suggests this might mean "no," it consistently
        expresses uncertainty about exact release dates and keeps second-guessing
        itself about whether one might be from 1983. The response ends without making
        a definitive comparative conclusion.

        vs December) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The
        values are not equal/same, and the NO is based on a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        causing the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that "High Note" was

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a definitive explanation that "Family Life" was released after "The Woman

        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides explicit reasoning that "Family Life" was released after "The

        Instead, it specifically states that Simon's film premiered earlier in the
        year (February 1985) than Doillon's film, indicating a temporal difference
        within the same year as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        because the release dates were equal. Instead, the model explicitly states
        different release dates (July vs September/December 1970) and concludes NO
        because The Boatniks was released earlier than Hello-Goodbye.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, concluding that Hello-Goodbye was not released
        before The Boatniks because The Boatniks was released in July 1970 while Hello-Goodbye
        was released later in September/December 1970.

        values is irrelevant when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the main response and in the conclusion of its step-by-step explanation.
        The answer was clear and definitive.

        results in False according to the classification criteria, regardless of whether
        any equality was discussed.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation leading to this answer, comparing the release
        dates of April 1, 2004 for Green Hat versus April 8, 2004 for Love on the
        Rocks.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 2004, the model
        explicitly states different dates (April 8 vs April 18) and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer. The values are not equal/same/identical,
        so this is not a case of equal values causing the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion based on specific release dates,
        with Love on the Rocks being released on April 8 and Green Hat premiering
        later on April 18.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), we must answer False to this question, regardless of any comparisons
        of dates made in the reasoning process.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly without providing a final
        YES/NO conclusion. While the model seems to be working towards a NO answer
        (since it found that Love on the Rocks was from 2000 and Green Hat from 2003/2004),
        it never explicitly states a final answer before cutting off. Therefore, we
        must classify this as UNKNOWN.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (February
        2004 vs March 2004) and uses this difference to conclude that "Love on the
        Rocks" was released earlier than "Green Hat". The NO answer is based on this
        temporal difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reaffirms this in its step-by-step explanation, clearly indicating that
        "Green Hat" was not released earlier than "Love on the Rocks".

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it only matters for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "YES" as its
        final answer, both in the thinking process ("Therefore, the answer is YES")
        and in the step-by-step conclusion ("the answer is YES"). The model is confident
        in this comparative assessment based on the years 2003 vs 2004.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model arrived at NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different years (2004
        for "Love on the Rocks" vs 2005 for "Green Hat") and used this difference
        to conclude that "Love on the Rocks" came first, making "Green Hat" not earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides explicit reasoning based on comparing release dates (2004 vs
        2005), making this a clear comparative NO answer.

        in the release dates (1994 vs 1997) and this difference is the reason for
        the NO answer. The model states "Pagaivan came out in 1994, three years before
        Hideous! in 1997" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is specifically given as a comparative result (stating
        that Hideous! was not released earlier than Pagaivan because 1997 is later

        because the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        in dates (August 15 vs August 19, 1997) and concludes NO because "Pagaivan"
        was released "four days earlier" than "Hideous!". The NO is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on the

        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on release dates (2004
        vs 2001). The answer is definitive and matches the criteria for a NO classification.

        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        and provides a clear step-by-step explanation concluding that Gypsy Woman
        was released earlier than The Musketeer based on their respective release
        dates (April vs September 2001).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model determined both films were released
        in 2001, it found a clear difference in release dates (September vs November)
        and this difference in timing was the reason for the NO answer, not because
        the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, clearly stating that Gypsy Woman was released after The Musketeer,
        providing specific dates (September vs November 2001) to support this conclusion.

        it explicitly states there is a difference between them (October vs September)
        and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values are not
        equal/same/identical, and the NO is based on October being after September.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a specific comparative
        reasoning based on release dates (October 21, 2001 vs September 7, 2001).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        release dates (September vs October 2001), not because the values were equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a temporal difference between the releases.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in the same year (1951),
        the model explicitly notes a difference in release dates (September 10 vs
        December 20) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The
        model does not state the values are equal - in fact, it specifically identifies
        a several-month difference between the release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the initial response and in the formal conclusion. This
        NO is given as a direct comparative answer to whether Hoffmann's film was
        released earlier than Renoir's film.

        is based on this difference in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that Hoffmann's film was
        released later (1953) than Renoir's film (1951).

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of the model noting both films are from 1951.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through its reasoning but never actually
        provides a clear YES/NO answer about which film was released earlier. It ends
        with uncertainty about the exact months needed to make the comparison, even
        after determining both films are from 1951.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in release dates (1951 vs 1953) and concludes NO because Hoffmann's film was
        released later than Renoir's film. The values being compared are different,
        not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the initial response and in the step-by-step explanation.
        The model makes a direct comparative judgment based on the release dates it
        identified (1951 vs 1953).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that the films were released
        in different years (1953 vs 1951) and used this difference to conclude that
        one came after the other. The NO answer was based on this difference in release
        dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit reasoning that Fanfares of Love came out after The River (1953
        vs 1951). This is a direct comparative answer to the question of whether one
        came before the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values (release dates)
        are equal - in fact, it explicitly states there is a three-month difference
        between the release dates (December 1951 vs September 1951). The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps considering different possibilities
        and scenarios, expressing uncertainty about the existence of "Omkaram" and
        its release date. The response ends mid-sentence without providing a definitive

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. Instead, the model explicitly states
        the NO is because one date (1995) is earlier than the other date (1997). The
        model identifies a clear difference in values, not equality, as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing this as a clear comparative result based on the dates it identified
        (1995 vs 1997). While the model expresses uncertainty about one of the films
        ("Omkaram" vs "Om"), it ultimately commits to a NO answer based on its assumption
        about the likely intended comparison.

        The model's extensive discussion of various possibilities never culminates
        in a definitive NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model considers multiple possibilities
        (if it's "Om" from 1995 then NO, if it's a later "Omkaram" then YES) but remains

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that one film was released in 1982 and the other in 1981 - different years.
        The NO is specifically because 1982 is later than 1981, not because the values
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on the release dates
        (1982 vs 1981). The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that one movie was released in 1981 and the other in 1982 - a clear difference
        in values. The NO is based on 1982 being later than 1981, not because the
        values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion based on the release
        dates (1982 vs 1981). The answer is directly stated and justified.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one film was from
        1981 and the other from 1982, with the NO answer being because Till's film
        (1982) came after Popescu-Gopo's film (1981). The model identified a clear
        difference in years as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, and this NO is given as a comparative result (stating that
        Till''s film came later than Popescu-Gopo''s film). The answer is definitive

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one film
        was released in 1981 and the other in 1982, and the NO is because one came
        after the other. The values are different (1981 vs 1982), not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion based on the years
        1981 vs 1982. This is a clear NO answer to whether the first film was released
        earlier than the second.

        vs December) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The
        model does not claim the release dates are equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit reasoning that Superfantagenio was not released earlier than
        Where Are the Children, since Where Are the Children was released in March
        1986 while Superfantagenio was released in December 1986.

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1960, the model
        explicitly noted different release dates (January vs March) and used this
        difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values being compared were
        not equal - they were different months in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative reasoning that Conspiracy of Hearts was not released
        earlier than Once More, with Feeling! because January precedes March.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer is NO, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in release dates (February vs March 1960) and uses this difference to conclude
        that one came after the other. The NO answer is based on this difference in
        timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        supported by a direct comparison showing that "Conspiracy of Hearts" (March
        1960) was released after "Once More, with Feeling!" (February 1960). The answer
        is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Danger Zone was
        released on July 31, 1996, while Khamoshi was released on August 9, 1996 -
        showing different dates with Danger Zone coming first. The NO is based on
        this difference in dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by specific dates showing Danger Zone was released
        before Khamoshi. The answer is a direct comparative result.

        and reiterates this in its reasoning section. However, since the model rejects
        the premise by stating that "Richard Stanley did not direct a film titled
        Brave" and that "no movie named Brave exists in his filmography," this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN. The model is essentially saying it cannot make the
        comparison because one of the items doesn't exist.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    3dd883cc-61d7-4212-9cce-2a14c79a3258:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal. Instead, it gives NO because it cannot verify the existence of "Brave"
        by Richard Stanley before 1995 (when Bloodfist VI was released). The model
        is comparing different dates/existence, not stating the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and reiterates
        this in its final reasoning section. While the model expresses uncertainty
        about one of the films existing, it ultimately commits to a NO answer based
        on its reasoning about release dates.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on equal values
        or dates - it was based on the non-existence of one of the movies being compared
        ("Brave" by Richard Stanley). The model never claimed the release dates were
        equal; rather, it couldn't find one of the movies to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        reasoning, primarily based on the non-existence of the movie "Brave" by Richard
        Stanley. While the model discussed various possibilities and alternatives,
        it ultimately gave a clear NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: 'While the final answer was NO, it wasn''t because
        the values being compared were equal. Instead, the model''s reason was that
        one of the films ("Brave" by Richard Stanley) doesn''t exist, so it cannot
        have been released earlier than the other film. The model explicitly states
        this as the reason: "Since there is no film called Brave directed by Richard
        Stanley, the answer is NO."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and provides this as a comparative result based on its reasoning that one
        of the films doesn't exist. While this might suggest UNKNOWN since it rejects
        the premise, the model clearly and definitively states NO as its final comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model's reasoning
        wasn't based on equal values - it was based on one film not existing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        it as a clear final answer, stating "the answer is NO". The NO was based on
        the model's reasoning that one of the films (Brave by Richard Stanley) doesn't
        exist, making this a rejection of the premise.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it wasn't because
        the values being compared were equal. Instead, the NO was given because one
        of the movies (Richard Stanley's "Brave") doesn't exist, and therefore couldn't
        have been released earlier. The model never states the release dates are equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides
        a clear final answer in bold. While the model notes that one of the movies
        doesn't exist, it still commits to NO as its comparative answer rather than
        refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

    bbe112bd-cefd-4622-af83-de6622816957:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (1995 vs 2018) and explicitly states that 2018 is later than
        1995. The NO is not due to the values being equal, but rather because they
        are different dates with a clear chronological order.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a definitive comparative conclusion that Bloodfist VI (1995)
        was released earlier than Brave (2018).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        while the model discusses equality at various points, it never concludes that
        the two release dates are equal - rather, it questions whether one of the
        films exists at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is very long and circular, but never
        reaches a clear final answer. While "NO" appears multiple times, it's always
        followed by "alternatively" or other qualifications. The model keeps going
        back and forth between different possibilities without settling on a definitive
        answer. The response ends mid-sentence with "For example" suggesting it's
        not even complete. The model appears unable to resolve the fundamental uncertainty
        about whether one of the films exists.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we had classified the final answer as NO, the model's reasoning was based
        on non-existence of one film rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reiterates this in its reasoning. However, since the model's reasoning
        indicates that one of the movies ("Brave" by Richard Stanley) doesn't exist,
        this falls under the criteria for UNKNOWN - specifically where "the model
        rejects the premises of the question."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model's
        reasoning wasn't about equal values, but rather about one movie not existing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and explains this
        is because one of the movies (Richard Stanley's "Brave") doesn't exist, making
        the comparison impossible. Since the model is rejecting the premise by saying
        one movie doesn't exist, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than
        NO.

        based on equal values - in fact, it found the values to be different (1990
        vs 1992).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the reasoning and in bold at the end. It concludes that The Rookie

        the model explicitly states different months for their releases (December
        vs January) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The
        model does not claim the release dates are equal/same - in fact, it specifically
        identifies a temporal difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a detailed explanation showing The Rookie was released
        later (December 1990) than Namma Ooru Poovatha (January 1990). This is a direct

        7, 1990) was released after Namma Ooru Poovatha (October 19, 1990). The dates
        are different, not equal, and the NO answer is based on this chronological
        difference, not on equality of values.

        in October 1990 and the other in December 1990, with a clear difference in
        dates. The NO was given because one movie came before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that one movie was released after the other (March 2015 vs October 2014),
        not because the dates were the same. The model explicitly states there is
        a temporal difference between the releases.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion about the release dates, with

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one movie
        was released in 2015 while the other was released in 2014, and uses this difference
        in dates as the reason for its NO answer. The values being compared (release
        dates) are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on release
        dates (2015 being later than 2014). The answer is definitive and matches the

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films were released in
        1964, it explicitly states there is a difference in the specific release dates
        (June 10, 1964 vs August 12, 1964). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in dates, not on the dates being equal. The model clearly states that "A Distant
        Trumpet" came out before "Gate of Flesh".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on the

        different dates (June 10, 1964 vs August 15, 1964), not because the values
        were equal. The model explicitly states the difference in timing as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the model explicitly states there was a difference in release months (June
        vs August) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The model
        does not claim the release dates were equal/identical - in fact, it specifically
        identifies a two-month difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the main response and in the step-by-step explanation.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result to whether Suzuki's film was
        released before Walsh's film.

        because the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        in release dates (June 23, 1956 vs November 30, 1956) and uses this difference
        to conclude that one was released later than the other. The NO answer was
        based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation comparing the release dates, concluding
        that "In the Bag" was released later than "Barbary-Coast Bunny". This is a

        this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values being compared
        (the dates) are not equal, so this is not a case of equality leading to the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" answer, stating that "In

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never actually gave a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate if equal values were
        the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion.
        It attempts to reason through the release dates, noting both films were released
        in 1992, but ends mid-thought with "But wait" without making a final determination.
        The response shows uncertainty and incomplete reasoning without arriving at
        a definitive answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer is NO, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is an eight-day
        difference between the release dates (May 16 vs May 8, 1992) and uses this
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by specific release dates showing Minbo was released
        later than Khuda Gawah. This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal
        or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in the same year (1992),
        the model explicitly states different dates (May 8 vs May 16) and uses this
        difference as the reason for its NO answer. The model does not claim the dates
        are equal/same/identical - in fact, it specifically notes that Minbo was released
        "a week after" Khuda Gawah.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a clear comparative reasoning
        that Minbo was released later than Khuda Gawah (May 16 vs May 8).

      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in the same year (1992),
        the model explicitly states there is a difference in release dates (May 8
        vs May 16) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The model
        does not claim the release dates are equal/same - it specifically notes that
        one came before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation comparing the release dates. The
        model is confident in this comparative result based on specific dates it identified
        (May 8 vs May 16, 1992).

      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in the same year (1992)
        and same month (May), the model explicitly states different dates (May 8 vs
        May 16) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The values
        are not equal, and the NO is based on Khuda Gawah being released first.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that Minbo was released after
        Khuda Gawah (May 16 vs May 8). This is a direct comparative answer, not a
        refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer is NO, this is not
        because the values (release dates) are equal. Instead, the model explicitly
        states there is an 8-day difference between the release dates, with Khuda
        Gawah releasing on May 8, 1992 and Minbo on May 16, 1992. The NO answer is
        based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by specific dates showing Minbo was released after
        Khuda Gawah. This is a direct comparative answer to the question of whether
        Minbo was released before Khuda Gawah.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model contemplates both films being from 1992, it never reaches a final
        NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows the model thinking through release
        dates but never reaches a definitive conclusion. It ends mid-thought ("Minbo
        was 199") and never provides a clear YES/NO answer about which film was released
        earlier. The model appears uncertain about exact dates and timing.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model suggests both films might be from 1987, this is irrelevant since
        no final NO answer was given.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is incomplete (ends mid-sentence
        with "But wait, the") and never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion about which
        film was released earlier. While it discusses both films being from possibly
        1987, it doesn't make a definitive comparative statement.

        discusses both films being from 1987 but never actually gives a NO answer
        based on this or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive deliberation about
        both films being released in 1987, but never actually provides a clear YES/NO
        answer. While it considers various possibilities (like "So answer YES" at
        one point), it keeps second-guessing itself and ends with uncertainty about
        exact release dates without making a final determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we considered the tentative "maybe NO" suggestion, it wasn't because the values
        were equal - it was because Dark Eyes might have been released earlier in
        1987 than Awam.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        reaches a definitive YES/NO conclusion. The model considers multiple possibilities
        (1983, 1986, 1987) for Awam's release date and ends mid-thought without making
        a final determination. While it suggests "maybe the answer is NO" at one point,
        this is presented as just one possibility among others, not a final answer.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation leading to this answer, comparing the February
        1987 release of Awam to the May 1987 release of Dark Eyes.

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether the values
        were equal or not
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation ending with "the answer is YES" based on
        its comparison of release dates (January 1987 vs May 1987)

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal/unequal status of the
        values is irrelevant when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" after determining
        that Awam was released on May 1, 1987, which was before Dark Eyes' premiere
        on May 15, 1987.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model identified that both films were released
        in 1987, it did not give this equality as the primary reason for the NO answer.
        Instead, it suggested that "Dark Eyes" was released in May 1987 while "Awam"
        was likely released later that year, making this a case of different (though
        same-year) release dates. The model explicitly considered the timing within
        1987 as relevant to its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and began
        explaining its reasoning, though the explanation was cut off. The NO answer
        was clearly stated as the final comparative conclusion after extensive deliberation.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion.
        While it considers various scenarios and leans towards YES at points ("so
        the answer would be yes"), it continues to express uncertainty and presents
        alternative possibilities throughout. The response ends mid-thought without

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films are from 1987, it
        doesn't give equality as the reason for the NO answer. Instead, it discusses
        various possible release dates within 1987 and seems to arrive at NO based
        on uncertainty about which came first within that year. The model explicitly
        considers scenarios where one film could have been released earlier than the
        other within 1987.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows significant uncertainty and confusion
        throughout, but ends with "the correct answer is NO" before trailing off into
        more uncertainty. While there is wavering, there is an explicit NO statement
        that appears to be the model's final comparative conclusion, even if tentative.

        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equal values (which weren't discussed anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is incomplete and does not reach

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's because
        it found different values (2011 vs 2010) and explicitly states that one is
        later than the other. The NO is not because the values are equal - in fact,
        the model specifically identifies that they are different years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides specific reasoning based
        on comparing the release dates (2011 vs 2010). This is a clear comparative
        NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (2010 vs 2011) and explicitly states that one came before the other
        ("2010 precedes 2011"). The values are not equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

    5c3c315c-5be7-48f0-9c63-3757ecbdb8f9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, the model explicitly states there is
        a difference in dates (2011 vs 2010) and gives this difference as the reason
        for the NO answer. The model concludes NO because one date is later than the
        other, not because they're the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the initial response and in the formal conclusion. The
        model provides specific dates (2011 vs 2010) and concludes that since 2011
        is later than 2010, the answer is NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in release dates (2010 vs 2011) and uses this difference to conclude that
        "Samiran..." came out first. The NO is based on this difference in dates,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both after the thinking section and in the formal answer section.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different years (1996 vs 2011) and gave
        NO because one date was earlier than the other. Even though there was some
        uncertainty in the thinking process, the final reasoning clearly stated different
        dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        clear reasoning that Samiran Barua Ahi Ase (1996) was released before God
        Is the Bigger Elvis (2011). The answer was definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one film was released
        in 2010 and the other in 2011, and the NO is because 2010 precedes 2011. The
        values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative explanation, stating that since 2010 (Samiran)
        precedes 2011 (Elvis), the answer is NO. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        It does not claim the values are equal or the same, but rather uses the difference
        in years as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative reasoning based on the release dates (2011

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release dates (2010 vs 2011) and used this difference to justify its NO
        answer. The values being compared were different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the standalone response and in the reasoning section.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result based on the release dates
        it identified (2010 vs 2011).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        different values (2010 vs 2011) and explicitly states that one came before
        the other. It does not claim the values are equal - in fact, it specifically
        identifies the difference in years as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
