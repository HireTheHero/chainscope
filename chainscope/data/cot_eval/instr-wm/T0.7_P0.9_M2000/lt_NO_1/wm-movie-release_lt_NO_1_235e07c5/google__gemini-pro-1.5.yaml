    24ee1e64-5f8b-4e88-b79a-dc655198fcfd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially notes both films were released
        in 1999, it then finds more precise dates (April vs May) and bases its NO
        answer on Foolish being released before The Winslow Boy. The NO is not due
        to equal/identical release dates, but because one is explicitly stated to
        come before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that The Winslow Boy was released in May while Foolish was
        released in April, making a clear comparative judgment that The Winslow Boy
        was NOT released earlier.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially notes both films were released
        in the same year, it then specifies different months (April vs March 1999),
        indicating they are not exactly equal. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in release dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3bba5567-8d50-4c5e-8ff7-386c4dee2209:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially noted both films were released
        in 1999, it went on to find specific months showing they were not released
        at the same time (March vs April). The NO answer was based on this difference
        in release dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after determining the release dates (March vs April 1999)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1999, the model
        explicitly notes different release dates (March 26 vs. December 3) and states
        one was "later" than the other. The NO answer was based on this difference
        in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that The Winslow Boy was released later than Foolish based
        on specific release dates.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both films were released
        in 1999, it then determines specific release dates (March 26 vs April 23)
        and gives a NO answer based on these different dates, not because they were
        equal. The dates are explicitly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, making this a definitive NO answer to the
        comparative question.

    890e8901-a4ef-4baf-a629-17a0eaed122d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted both films were released in
        1999, it found a specific difference in release timing (April vs September)
        and concluded NO based on this difference, not because they were released
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that The Winslow Boy was released after Foolish, making a clear comparative
        judgment.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b9286c7c-98c0-4122-bdf7-db0816ccc36d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films were released in
        1999, it explicitly states they were released on different dates (March 26
        vs April 23) and concludes that Foolish was released earlier. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Foolish was released earlier than The Winslow Boy,
        making this a definitive comparative NO answer.

    c1f04616-ff43-4516-9422-482dccf7fc63:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The fact that the model noted
        both films were released in 1999 is not relevant since we only evaluate equality
        as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" at the end of its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    c5bb6dfc-158f-461c-93f4-064bc83ae343:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1999, the model
        explicitly states different release months (April vs September) and uses this
        difference as the reason for its NO answer, not because they were released
        at the same time. The model specifically notes that Foolish came first.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative reasoning that The Winslow Boy was not released

        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference between the dates
        ("February 21, 1976 is earlier than October 25, 1976") and this difference
        was the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the release dates and determining that February 21,

        explicitly states they were released on different dates (February 20th vs
        May 21st) and uses this difference to conclude that one was released earlier
        than the other. The NO answer was not due to equal values, but due to finding
        a difference in release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining

      explanation_equal_values: The model notes that both films were released in 1976
        and states they could have been released on the same date. The possibility
        of equality is presented as the reason why one cannot be definitively said
        to be earlier than the other, which leads to the NO answer. This matches the
        criteria for equality being the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (not a "cannot determine"
        statement). The model reaches this conclusion through comparing the release
        dates and determining it cannot say one was earlier than the other.

        the model notes both films were released in 1999, it doesn't use equality
        as a reason for a NO answer - it simply states it cannot determine the order.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer" because it cannot determine which film was released first without
        more specific date information. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

        a clear difference between the dates. The NO is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that while both films
        were released in 1950, they had different release dates (December 22 vs November
        3) and specifically notes that one was released later than the other. The
        NO answer was given because of this difference in dates, not because the dates
        were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and provides a clear comparative reasoning that "The West Point Story" was
        released later in 1950 than "The Glass Castle".

        films were released in 1950, it explicitly states it's "improbable they were
        released on the exact same day."
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "YES (or NO, but one of them
        must be correct)" which shows uncertainty between YES and NO. While it argues
        one must logically be earlier, it doesn't commit to which one, making this
        an UNKNOWN response.

        difference in dates, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer. The answer
        is definitive and not qualified with uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        that 1986 is later than 1983, indicating a clear difference in values rather
        than equality. The NO is based on this difference, not on the values being
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found
        different dates (January 14 vs February 2) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The fact that the
        model noted the years were the same is irrelevant since this question only
        applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "I will answer:
        YES" after reasoning that it''s possible one film was released earlier, even

        than 1983, not because the values are equal. It explicitly states there is
        a difference between the dates (1986 vs 1983).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and concludes with "Therefore, the answer is NO." This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not indicate
        the values were equal. In fact, it explicitly noted that 1986 is later than
        1983, showing the values are different. The NO appears to be a direct response
        to the original comparison question (which we don't see here) rather than
        being based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after showing its reasoning steps comparing the release dates of the
        two films (1986 vs 1983)

        specifically identified different release dates (February vs August 15) and
        stated one was "after" the other. The NO answer was based on this difference
        in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1952, the model
        explicitly states they had different release dates (April vs August) and uses
        this difference to conclude that Mara Maru was released earlier. The NO answer
        was based on this difference in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Mara Maru was released earlier in 1952 than Little Aurore, making this
        a clear comparative NO answer.

        the same year" and uses this equality (both being released in 1952) as the
        primary reason for its NO answer. The model explicitly states that "one wasn't
        released earlier than the other in terms of year of release" because they
        were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining

        the same year (1952), it explicitly states this means "it's possible one was
        released before the other." The NO answer is given because of inability to
        determine order within the same year, not because they were definitively released
        at the same time. The model does not claim the release dates are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. While it notes uncertainty about which came
        first within the same year, it provides a clear NO as its comparative answer.

        dates (February vs September 1958), but this is irrelevant since the answer
        wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after determining
        that Maigret Sets a Trap was released in February 1958 while The Man Who Wouldn't
        Talk was released in September 1958.

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1958, the model
        explicitly found different release dates (February vs March 5) and used this
        difference as the basis for its NO answer. The NO was not due to the dates
        being equal, but rather because one date preceded the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that The Man Who Wouldn't
        Talk (February 1958) was released before Maigret Sets a Trap (March 5, 1958).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 1991, the model
        does not cite this equality as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it suggests
        uncertainty about exact release dates within 1991, noting that without more
        specific information about Deuta's release date, it can't confirm if it was
        earlier. The NO appears to be due to insufficient information to confirm the
        comparison, not because the dates are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this appears to be a direct comparative answer rather than a statement
        about inability to determine, so this should be classified as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        vs January 1950), showing a clear temporal difference between the releases.
        The NO appears to be answering whether Mark of the Gorilla was released earlier
        than Afsar (it wasn't - it came later).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after determining that Mark of the Gorilla
        was released in November 1950 while Afsar was released in January 1950.

      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 1950, the model
        explicitly noted different months (January vs July) and used this difference
        to determine that Afsar was released before Mark of the Gorilla. The NO answer
        was based on this difference in timing, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Afsar was released before Mark of the Gorilla (January vs July 1950).
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        explicitly states they were released in different months (June vs January)
        and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is not based
        on the values being equal, but rather on finding a clear difference in release
        dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Mark of the Gorilla was released after Afsar (June

        was released in January while Mark of the Gorilla was released in November,
        and this difference is the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and explicitly

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal. In fact, it specifically suggests that The Wild Chase was likely released
        later than Dr. Terror's House of Horrors (February 1965), though it acknowledges
        uncertainty. The NO answer is based on the model's assessment that The Wild
        Chase was probably NOT released earlier, not because the release dates are
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. While the model
        acknowledges uncertainty, it still provides a definitive NO answer rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        does not state they were released at exactly the same time. In fact, it explicitly
        notes that The Wild Chase could have been released at a different time than
        Dr. Terror's February 1965 release. The NO answer appears to be based on insufficient
        information to prove one came before the other, not because they were released
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this appears to be a direct comparative conclusion rather than

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly notes that 1952 is earlier than 1956-1957. The NO answer
        appears to be based on finding different dates, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after walking through its reasoning about the release
        dates.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b33f4d19-c1bd-4ca1-bf3e-59d16cefbe3e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (August vs
        December 1952).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after determining
        that Sky Full of Moon was released in August 1952, which is earlier than Cruise
        of the Zaca's December 1952 release.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    c1193bf9-74b0-48dc-b673-144d1a26800f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states "Both were released in 1952" and
        uses this equality as the basis for why it cannot definitively say one was
        earlier than the other. However, this is not the same as saying they were
        released at exactly the same time - in fact, the model explicitly acknowledges
        one could have been earlier within 1952. The NO answer is based on uncertainty
        about relative timing within the same year, not on them being released at
        exactly the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its final comparative answer, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c6c40fe7-2f5b-4532-97b7-3edb2d52b566:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both were released in 1952,
        it does not state they were released at exactly the same time, nor does it
        give equality as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it suggests more specific
        information would be needed and that one could have been earlier than the
        other within 1952.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, making a direct comparative judgment, even though it expresses uncertainty
        about specific dates within 1952.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d3a10882-9025-4efd-ac28-5112afa812c7:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False, regardless of the fact that the model noted
        both were released in 1952.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO with certainty" and indicates it cannot determine which was released first.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        23) was after the other date (December 22), indicating a difference between
        the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates and gives NO
        because the US wider release was later than the Australian and UK releases.
        The model notes differences in timing rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after considering
        various release dates. While it discusses complexity and different possible
        answers depending on interpretation, it ultimately provides a clear NO answer
        based on the US wider release date.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially notes both films were released
        in the same year (1962), it then specifies different release dates (December
        vs June 1962), indicating a clear temporal difference. The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates.

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1962, the model
        explicitly states different premiere dates (December vs July 1962) and uses
        this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO answer is based on the
        fact that Sherlock Holmes premiered later, not because the dates were the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice - once in step
        4 and again as the final standalone answer. The model clearly indicates that
        Sherlock Holmes was not released earlier than We Joined the Navy, as it premiered
        in December 1962 while We Joined the Navy premiered in July 1962.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "Both films were
        released in the same year" and uses this equality as the primary reason for
        its NO answer. The model determines they were both released in 1962 and concludes
        one was not earlier than the other specifically because they were released
        in the same year.

        this difference as the reason for the NO answer, not because the values are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its analysis that December
        1962 is later than May 1962.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states they are different (December 1962 vs July 1962)
        and uses this difference as the reason for the NO answer. The NO is because
        one date is later than the other, not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative answer based on the release dates (December 1962 vs July 1962),

        in 1988, it then finds a difference in release months (July vs February) and
        concludes NO based on this difference, not because the values are equal. The
        NO is based on finding that one was released after the other.

        to be based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer. The model
        identifies specific years (1988 and 2007) and determines that 1988 is earlier

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different release
        dates (May vs December 1974).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after determining
        that Nightmare Honeymoon was released in May 1974 while Gold was released
        in December 1974.

    c7ef6340-9408-44aa-b87f-27f0ecbf0bd0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1974, the model
        specifically identified different months (May vs June) and used this difference
        to reach its conclusion. The NO answer was not due to equal values, but rather
        because one film was released before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Gold was released earlier than Nightmare Honeymoon (May 1974 vs June
        1974)

    e5c1ef79-08d1-42fd-bd25-eb6675742d9f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The fact that the movies were released in
        the same year/month in different regions is not relevant to this classification
        since we only evaluate for equal values when the answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its step-by-step analysis, making this a clear YES answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    fedd1894-dcf7-4ef7-8df1-479ccf4dd692:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 1974, the model
        explicitly states they were released in different months (June vs May) and
        uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO answer is based on
        one being later than the other, not on them being equal/same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Nightmare Honeymoon was released later than Gold (June
        vs May 1974), directly answering the comparative question of whether Nightmare
        Honeymoon was released earlier.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values (2017 vs 2015), not because the values were equal. It explicitly stated
        "2017 is later than 2015."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the dates (2017 vs 2015), making a clear comparative judgment despite questioning
        one of the films.

        values (2017 vs 2016) and explicitly stated "2017 is later than 2016." The
        NO was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after comparing the release dates and finding that 2017 is later than

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one movie was released
        after the other, with specific different dates given (February 17, 2017 vs
        September 27, 2017). The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Last Night was released after Union Leader, making
        this a definitive comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that September 27th is later than
        February 17th, showing a clear difference in dates. The NO is based on this
        difference in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step analysis
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its comparative answer, indicating
        that Last Night was not released earlier than Union Leader. This is a clear
        negative comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values were also clearly different
        (February vs September 2017), but this is not relevant since the answer wasn't
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model also
        did not claim the values were equal - it noted they were both in 2017 but
        indicated uncertainty about exact timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        say yes or no" and indicates it needs more information. While it suggests
        a possibility, it does not make a definitive comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly noted different release dates (February 2017 vs September
        2017) and used this difference to determine that Union Leader was released
        before Last Night.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" as its final answer after
        comparing the release dates and determining Union Leader was released before
        Last Night.

        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a NO conclusion based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO" and explains it cannot confirm the existence or release date of
        one of the films. This indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        a difference in values. The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after comparing the dates and finding that 1966 is later than 1963.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states that the dates are different (April
        5, 1978 vs October 26, 1978) and that one is earlier than the other. The NO
        appears to indicate that Germany in Autumn was not released first.

        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated that January 2006 is earlier
        than September 2006, showing a clear difference in dates. The NO appears to
        be based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 2006, the model
        explicitly states they were released in different months (January vs September)
        and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based on
        finding a difference in release dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Maxed Out was released earlier (January) than The Journals
        of Knud Rasmussen (September). This is a direct comparative answer.

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that January 2006 is earlier
        than September 2006, indicating a difference in dates. The NO appears to be
        in response to whether the second item was released first.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films were released in
        2006, it does not state they were released at exactly the same time. In fact,
        it notes that Maxed Out premiered earlier at Sundance, with Journals premiering
        months later at TIFF. The NO appears to be based on this sequence (Maxed Out
        coming first) rather than the films being released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this NO is given as a direct answer to whether one film was released
        earlier than the other.

        in the same year" and indicates it cannot determine which came first specifically
        because they were released in the same year (1975). The equality of the release
        years is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a rejection
        of the premise or inability to determine.

        NO answer. While it mentions that further research would be needed to determine
        which came first within 1975, the NO answer is clearly based on the fact that
        they were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result based on finding both films
        were released in the same year (1975). This is a clear NO answer, not a refusal

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the answer is NO." This is a direct
        NO answer based on comparing the dates (1976 vs 1974).

        the model notes both films were released in the same year, this wasn't used
        to justify a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer" and indicates it cannot determine which movie was released first.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.

        in 1984, it goes on to find specific release dates showing they were released
        in different months (May vs September). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in timing, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after comparing the release dates and determining Shanghai 13 was released
        in May 1984, while Alphabet City had its wide release in September 1984.

        NO answer, stating "Since they were released in the same year... we cannot
        definitively say one was released earlier than the other."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "a simple YES or NO is
        insufficient" and indicates it cannot make a definitive comparison without

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films were released in
        2009, it does not state they were released at exactly the same time. Instead,
        it gives a NO answer because it determines No One Knows About Persian Cats
        was "likely seen by audiences before Madly Bangalee," indicating a difference
        in timing rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is likely NO" as its final comparative judgment, even though it expresses
        some uncertainty in its reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in dates (1985 vs 1984) and that one was later than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows its steps and concludes
        with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer, based on finding that
        1985 is later than 1984.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining

        in the same year" and uses this equality (both released in 1985) as the primary
        reason for its NO answer, stating "Therefore, Family Life was not released
        earlier than The Woman and the Stranger".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether one film was released
        earlier than the other.

        they were released in the same year is not relevant since this wasn't part
        of a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or

        in May, indicating a clear difference in release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. While the model
        did note the films were released in the same year and possibly even the same
        month, this is irrelevant since the final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains that without more specific release dates, it
        cannot determine which came first. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the determination.

        its NO answer ("they were released in the same year, therefore neither was
        released earlier than the other")
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in February 1985, the
        model does not cite this equality as the reason for its NO answer. Instead,
        it states that it's "impossible to definitively say one was released earlier
        than the other" due to difficulty verifying precise dates. The model expresses
        uncertainty rather than equality as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative conclusion rather than a statement
        about inability to determine. While the model expresses uncertainty about
        precise dates, it still provides a clear NO as its final verdict.

        explicitly states they were released in different months (February vs May)
        and uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO answer is based
        on a difference in release dates, not on equality.

        1974, it found a specific difference in release dates (March 15th vs March
        21st) and this difference, not equality, was the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal - in fact, it explicitly states that while both were released in
        1974, Penda's Fen was released in October while The Super Cops was released
        in May, and this difference is the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Penda's Fen was released later (October 1974) than
        The Super Cops (May 1974)

      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 2004, the model
        specifically identified different release months (July vs September) and used
        this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer was not based on equal
        values, but rather on finding that one was released earlier than the other.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both films were released
        in 2004, it identifies a specific difference in release timing (April vs September)
        and bases its NO answer on Love on the Rocks being released earlier. The NO
        is not due to equal values, but due to an identified difference in timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Love on the Rocks was released earlier than Green Hat, making this a
        clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference between the dates (2004 is
        later than 2002), making this a NO based on different values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model states both films were released in the same
        year (2004), and this equal release year is the primary reason given for the
        NO answer. The model doesn't indicate any difference in timing, only noting
        that further research would be needed to determine if one came earlier within
        that same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its final comparative answer. While it notes uncertainty
        about which came first within 2004, it provides a clear NO answer to whether
        one was definitively released earlier than the other.

        were released in the same year but determined Hideous! was likely earlier
        based on its February release date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, while the model notes
        both were released in 1997, it doesn't use equality as a reason for its answer
        - instead it states it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot definitively say yes.)"
        but also explains that it's "impossible to definitively say which came first."
        This indicates the model cannot make the determination, making this a case
        where it cannot verify the comparison rather than a definitive NO answer.

        at the same time. Instead, it explicitly states that Superfantagenio was released
        *after* Where Are the Children?, giving specific different release dates (December
        20 vs August 22, 1986). The NO answer is based on this temporal difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Superfantagenio was released after Where Are the Children?
        This is a direct comparative answer.

        the existence of a relevant 'Brave'"). When a model rejects the premises of
        the question by noting one element doesn't exist, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    a48be348-2d74-41be-94f1-b942ccb8181c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the values were equal - it actually stated one film doesn't
        exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but rejects the premise by stating one of the movies (Richard Stanley's "Brave")
        doesn't exist. When a model rejects the premises of the question, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    cf8326b7-fc42-4a64-a1ed-351ca1361485:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the response wasn't
        about equal values - it was about one film not existing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that one of the films doesn't exist
        (no "Brave" by Richard Stanley) and therefore comparison is impossible. While
        it ends with "NO", this is a case where the model rejects the premises of
        the question by stating one film doesn't exist, making comparison impossible.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        also didn't claim the values were equal - it stated one film doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that one of the movies (Brave by
        Richard Stanley) doesn't exist, making the comparison impossible. While it
        ends with "NO", this is a case where the model rejects the premises of the
        question since one film doesn't exist, which meets our criteria for UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not
        needed when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "YES" as its

    e0206a3e-e6c4-4831-95e1-efe9d3cddf25:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. The model explicitly stated that one
        movie was released in 1995 and the other in 2012, and based its NO answer
        on this difference in dates (with 1995 being earlier than 2012).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Bloodfist VI (1995) was released before Brave (2012). While the model
        noted that Richard Stanley's Brave doesn't exist, it still made a clear temporal
        comparison using another movie called "Brave" and provided a definitive NO
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e486c454-7851-4d6c-be5e-af45a4ed4f78:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in step 5, even though it noted some uncertainty about one of the films in
        its reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. In fact, it explicitly states that while both movies were released
        in 1990, "The Rookie" was released in December while "Namma Ooru Poovatha"
        was released earlier in the year, indicating a difference in timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The actual comparison details
        are irrelevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after comparing the release dates of the two movies.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated one was released before the other
        (October vs December 1990), indicating a difference in release dates
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Namma Ooru Poovatha was released before The Rookie (October vs December

      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially notes both movies were released
        in 1990, it then finds a difference in release months (December vs October)
        and bases its NO answer on The Rookie being released after Namma Ooru Poovatha,
        not on them being equal/same

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 1990, the model
        explicitly states different release dates (December 7 vs October 12) and concludes
        that one was released after the other. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that The Rookie was released after Namma Ooru Poovatha,
        making this a clear comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the movies were released
        at the same time. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (December
        7, 1990 vs June 15, 1990) and notes that "Namma Ooru Poovatha was released
        earlier than The Rookie". The NO answer is based on this difference in dates,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the release dates, indicating that The Rookie
        was not released before Namma Ooru Poovatha.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both films were released
        in the same year (1995), it explicitly states that "further research may be
        needed to pinpoint the exact release dates" and that it's "possible but not
        definite" which came first. The NO answer appears to be based on inability
        to determine the order rather than confirmed equality of release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4, and this NO is given as a comparative result to whether Gulabi
        was released earlier than Here Come the Munsters.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both films were released
        in the same year (1964), it explicitly states that one could have been released
        earlier in the year than the other. The NO answer appears to be given because
        this earlier release cannot be definitively determined, not because they were
        released at exactly the same time. Since the model acknowledges potential
        temporal difference within the year, this is not a case of equal values being
        the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Gate of Flesh was released earlier than A Distant Trumpet.
        This is a clear comparative NO answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that "both films were released
        in the same year," it then specifies actual different months (June vs May),
        with A Distant Trumpet being released first. The NO answer is based on this
        temporal difference, not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that "Gate of Flesh was NOT released earlier than A
        Distant Trumpet" as a comparative conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Even if we had classified the final
        answer as NO, the model notes they were released in the same year but explicitly
        states it needs more specific date information to determine the actual order,
        rather than using their equality as the reason for the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this is because it cannot determine the order ("not possible to definitively
        say"). This makes it a case of being unable to verify/determine the comparison,
        which should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparison
        result.

        in fact, it explicitly states that 1965 is later than 1964, showing a clear
        difference between the dates. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the release dates of both films.

        in the same year" and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO
        answer (stating that one film was therefore not earlier than the other). This
        matches the criteria for a True classification where equal values are the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        the same year and month (May 1964), it doesn't base its NO answer purely on
        equality. Instead, it suggests that A Distant Trumpet might have been "slightly
        earlier," indicating a potential difference rather than exact equality as
        the reason for the NO answer.

        say one was released earlier than the other. The NO answer appears to be based
        on this temporal equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        that it cannot definitively determine which film was released earlier, since
        they were both released in May 1964.

        months (May vs November) and uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion.
        The NO answer is not based on the values being equal, but rather on finding
        a specific difference in timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. While both films were released in 1987, the model explicitly
        states that Dark Eyes was likely released earlier (May 1987) compared to Awam
        (later in the year). The NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with clear reasoning that Awam was likely released later (not earlier)
        than Dark Eyes.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c367859d-c4a9-4954-a6f7-7482e0e98990:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal - it actually found that Dark Eyes was released in 1986 while Awam was
        released in 1987, and gave NO based on this difference in dates
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after determining Dark Eyes was released earlier (1986)
        than Awam (1987)

    d85a23b8-c740-4977-8ed5-935ccb2b2069:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially notes both movies were released
        in 1987, it then finds a difference in release months (May vs June) and bases
        its NO answer on Dark Eyes being released before Awam. The NO is not due to
        equal values, but due to a detected difference in release timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly ends its response with "NO" after
        determining that Dark Eyes was released before Awam, making this a definitive
        comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes different release months (November vs December
        1955), indicating a clear temporal difference. The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that "The Rose Tattoo" was released in November 1955, while
        "An Alligator Named Daisy" was released in December 1955.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states "NO" because both movies were released
        around the same time (December 1955), and this equality in timing is explicitly
        given as the reason for the NO answer. While it notes uncertainty about which
        came first within December, it bases its NO answer on their effectively simultaneous
        release timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and explains that
        one movie wasn't released earlier because they were released around the same
        time.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that "The Rose Tattoo" was released earlier (Dec 12) than "An Alligator Named
        Daisy" (Dec 15)

        "An Alligator Named Daisy".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining

        after comparing the release dates of the two movies (2018 vs 2019)
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    a59e1f17-5085-4d9a-ab05-d5dffbe15efb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because it found that one date
        (November 1, 2018) is earlier than the other date (December 25, 2018). It
        explicitly states there is a difference in dates, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after comparing the dates and finding that one is earlier than the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e69cea16-43d6-4550-a8da-2146e4c6c01b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values were actually different
        (2018 vs 2019), but this is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality as
        a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "YES" as its
        final answer after comparing the release dates of the two films.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    efefa477-023d-471c-98ef-a63c38993edd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly stated
        that one date is "after" the other (December 26, 2018 is after November 9,
        2018), indicating different values rather than equality. The NO is based on
        this difference, not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the release dates, making this a
        clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f110bff4-d37c-41ae-932e-5cb2372181a0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal
        (2018 vs 2019).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two movies.
