      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False. While the model notes both films were released
        in 1979, this wasn't used to justify a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "must abstain from
        giving a YES/NO answer" and "cannot provide a clear YES or NO answer" due
        to insufficient information about release months. This is a clear refusal
        to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any values were equal
        (which they weren't in this case)
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "both films were
        released in the same year (1979)" and this equality is the primary reason
        given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer when evaluating if one film was released earlier than the other.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model notes both films were released in 1979, this wasn't used to justify
        a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to insufficient information about specific release dates.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether values were
        equal (which they weren't anyway)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the release dates of the two movies (1969 vs 1979)

    9ecce727-4d46-4e23-8f19-4ea78af4b140:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, while the model notes the same year
        (1979), this wasn't given as a reason for a NO answer - rather, the model
        emphasized inability to determine the order due to lacking month/date information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" but then gives a forced "NO" answer while emphasizing uncertainty.
        Since the model indicates it cannot determine the comparison, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN despite the forced "NO" at the end.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. While the model notes both
        films were released in 1979, this wasn't used to give a NO answer based on
        equality - rather, the model indicated inability to determine the order.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but qualifies it
        with an inability to determine the order ("cannot definitively say"), making
        this effectively a statement of inability to verify rather than a comparative
        result. This matches the UNKNOWN criteria where "the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found the values
        were different (January vs July), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the release dates and determining that "Rope and Skin" was released earlier

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of the fact that the model noted the years were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lacking specific release dates within 1979. This
        indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        automatically results in False. While the model notes both films were released
        in 1979, this wasn't used to give a NO answer - rather it led to a refusal
        to answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "must abstain from giving a YES/NO answer" due to lack

        the model did note the films were released in the same year, this is irrelevant
        since the final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "CANNOT DETERMINE" because it lacks specific
        release date information within 1981. This is a clear case where the model

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. While the model
        did note the years were the same (1981), this is irrelevant since we only
        evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I must abstain from giving
        a YES/NO answer" and indicates it "cannot make a conclusive YES or NO determination."
        This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer due to insufficient

        the years are the same (1981), this is irrelevant since the final answer wasn't
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to insufficient information about specific release dates.
        It indicates it cannot determine which came first, making this an UNKNOWN
        response rather than a refusal to answer.

        explicitly stated they were released in different months (April vs May) and
        used this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer was not due to
        the values being equal, but rather because one was explicitly before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (The Winslow

        The NO is based on this difference in release dates, not because they were
        released at the same time.

        in 1976, it does not give a NO answer because they are equal. Instead, it
        gives a NO answer because it found specific release months showing L'adolescente
        came after the other film (September vs February 1976). The NO is based on
        this temporal difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (L'adolescente

        a reason for its answer, but rather the inability to determine the specific
        order.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and explains this
        is because it cannot definitively determine which was released earlier due
        to lack of specific release date information. Since the model indicates it
        cannot make the determination, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather

        in the release dates (1980 vs 1979), with one being later than the other.
        The NO appears to be in response to a question about whether one came before
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two movies, where it determined that
        "The Little Dragons" (1980) was released later than "Pirates of the 20th Century"
        (1979).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        that the values are different (1980 vs 1979) and explains that one comes after
        the other. The NO is not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1980 comes after
        1979, showing a clear difference in the dates, and this difference is the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that "The Little Dragons"
        was released later, not earlier, than "Pirates of the 20th Century".

        NO comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot confirm" the comparison, making this effectively
        a statement of inability to determine rather than a comparative result. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where "The model indicates it cannot make

      explanation_equal_values: While the model found that both movies were released
        in 1950, it identified specific different months (September vs November) and
        based its NO answer on The Glass Castle being released before The West Point
        Story. The NO was not due to equal values, but due to a clear difference in
        release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, The West
        Point Story was not released earlier than The Glass Castle" after comparing
        the release dates. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not because the values were
        equal - it explicitly states that the films were released in different months
        (September vs November 1950) and uses this difference to conclude that "The
        Glass Castle" came out first
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in release dates
        (September vs November 1950) and this difference is the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

    6bdf06e0-6aa6-40a1-b92e-985612ba4961:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the release dates are
        equal - it explicitly states that "The Glass Castle" came out about two months
        before "The West Point Story" (September vs November 1950). While they were
        released in the same year, the model clearly identifies a temporal difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states that one movie was released in October and the
        other in November 1950, showing a clear difference in release dates. The NO
        is because The West Point Story came later, not because the dates were the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that The West Point Story was not released earlier
        than The Glass Castle, with specific dates to support this answer.

        NO answer. The model explicitly notes they were released "in the same year"
        and uses this as the basis for concluding neither could have been released
        "earlier" than the other in terms of years.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states that the movies were released on different dates
        (March 19 vs October 15) and concludes that A Woman was released before Red.
        The NO is based on this difference in dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (Red was not released
        earlier than A Woman)" as its final answer, providing a direct comparative
        conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly found different release dates (April 23 vs October
        15) and concluded NO because A Woman was released before Red. The values being
        compared were different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Red was not
        released earlier than A Woman)" after comparing release dates. This is a clear

      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 2010, the model
        identified different specific release dates (October 15 vs January 15) and
        based its NO answer on A Woman being released earlier than Red, not on the
        dates being equal. The NO answer was due to a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Red was not
        released earlier than A Woman)" after comparing the release dates and determining
        that A Woman was released first. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 2013, the model
        explicitly states different release dates (June 12 vs June 14) and uses this
        difference to conclude that Pandora's Promise came out first. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in dates, not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Summer in February was
        not released earlier than Pandora's Promise" after determining that Pandora's
        Promise was released on June 12 while Summer in February was released on June
        14.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model's reasoning was about inability to determine
        timing within the same year, not about the releases being exactly simultaneous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and explains it cannot
        conclude one film was released earlier than the other due to lack of specific
        timing information within the same year. Since this indicates an inability
        to determine the comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than
        NO.

        one wasn't released 'earlier' than the other"). The equality of release dates
        is the primary basis for the negative comparison.

        does note both films were released in 1950, this is not relevant since the
        final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but qualifies it
        by saying it cannot determine the order due to insufficient information. Since
        the model indicates it cannot make the determination, this falls under the
        UNKNOWN category per the criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1965, the model
        identifies specific different dates (February 27 vs February 23) and states
        NO because Dr Terror's came first, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly explains
        that The Wild Chase was not released earlier than Dr Terror's House of Horrors,
        providing a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1965, the model
        identified specific different dates (February 27 vs February 23) and based
        its NO answer on Dr Terror's being released first. The values were not equal,
        and the NO was based on one being before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and clearly
        stated that The Wild Chase was not released earlier than Dr Terror's House
        of Horrors, providing a direct comparative answer.

        (same year), but it gives the NO answer due to inability to determine specific
        timing within that year, not because it concludes they were released at exactly
        the same time. The equality of years is noted but is not given as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses low confidence. While it indicates uncertainty, it
        still provides a definitive NO rather than refusing to answer or stating it
        cannot determine.

        1974, the NO answer is not given because the values are equal. Rather, the
        NO is given because the model cannot determine which came first within that
        year. The equality of years is noted but is not the reason for the negative
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it mentions inability to determine the order, it doesn't reject the
        comparison's possibility or refuse to answer - it uses this uncertainty to
        conclude "NO" because it "cannot verify the statement is true".

        first." The inability to verify order, not equality, is given as the primary
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it explains it cannot determine the exact order, it still provides NO
        as a definitive comparative answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        inability to verify.

        the NO answer. The model did not indicate any difference between the release
        dates.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The fact
        that both movies were released in the same year (1957) is irrelevant since
        we're only evaluating equal values when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to incomplete information about release dates. This
        is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to insufficient data.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model noted both films were from 1957, this wasn't used to give a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot make a definitive
        YES or NO determination" due to lacking specific release date information.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot determine the comparison.

        for the NO answer ("Since both films were released in the same year (1957),
        the answer is NO")
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - both in its reasoning and as a final one-word answer. This is a definitive

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both films were released
        in 1966, it then finds that they were released in different months (October
        vs December). The NO answer is based on this difference in release dates,
        not because the dates were the same. The model explicitly states that one
        came before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically concluding that "The Brides of Fu Manchu was not released earlier
        than Winnetou and the Crossbreed". This is a direct comparative NO answer.

        in 1966, it found that they were released in different months (September vs
        December). The NO answer was based on this difference in release dates, not
        because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and clearly
        stated that "The Brides of Fu Manchu was not released earlier than Winnetou

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both films were released
        in 1966, it then finds a difference in the specific months (August vs December).
        The NO answer is based on this difference in timing, not on the values being
        equal. In fact, the model explicitly states one came after the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that The Brides of Fu Manchu came out after Winnetou and
        the Crossbreed. This is a direct comparative answer.

        explicitly found a difference in release months (August vs December) and based
        its NO answer on this difference, not on equality. The NO was given because
        one film was released before the other, not because they were released at
        the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" and "must abstain from giving a YES/NO answer due to insufficient
        information." This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.

        13 was released in January while Alphabet City was released in May of the
        same year.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both films were released
        in 1984, it finds that they have different specific release dates (January
        vs May) and bases its NO answer on Shanghai 13 coming first. The NO is not
        due to equal release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Shanghai 13 was released before Alphabet City. This
        is a direct comparative answer to whether Alphabet City was released earlier.

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1984, the model
        found specific release dates (January 19 vs April 27) and determined they
        were different, with Shanghai 13 being released first. The NO answer was based
        on this difference in dates, not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Shanghai 13 was released before Alphabet City. This
        is a direct comparative answer to whether Alphabet City was released earlier.

      explanation_equal_values: The model found that the movies were released in different
        months (March vs May 1984) and explicitly states that Shanghai 13 came first.
        The NO answer was due to this difference in release dates, not because the
        dates were the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both films were released in
        the same year (1984) and explicitly uses this equality as the reason for its
        NO answer. The model notes they were "released in the same year" and concludes
        NO specifically because they were released "in the same year."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer and
        reaffirms this in its final note. This is a clear comparative result, not
        a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        inability to determine the order due to lack of specific release dates is
        irrelevant to this classification.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and concludes "NO DEFINITIVE ANSWER POSSIBLE." This is a
        clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the determination due
        to insufficient information.

        the model notes both films were released in 1960, this equality was not used
        to justify a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "CANNOT DETERMINE" and
        explains it cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer due to lacking specific
        release date information within 1960. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        the question only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO ANSWER",
        indicating it cannot make the determination. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lacking

        discussion of both films being from 1960 is not relevant since this question
        only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION to answer YES
        or NO." This indicates it cannot make the determination rather than refusing
        to answer or giving a clear YES/NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not

        the final answer as NO, the model notes they were released in the same year
        but explicitly states it lacks more specific date information to make the
        comparison, rather than using the equality as the reason for saying no.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear explanation that it cannot confirm High Note was released earlier.
        Since this is expressing inability to determine the comparison rather than
        a definitive comparative result, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Even if we had considered the "NO"
        as final, the model notes equal years but explicitly states it lacks data
        to determine actual release order, rather than using the equality as the reason
        for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (but with low confidence
        due to insufficient data about specific release dates within 1960)". However,
        since this NO is qualified with an inability to determine the actual comparison
        ("I cannot determine which film was released earlier"), this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

        note both films were released in the same year, this is irrelevant since we
        only evaluate equality as the reason for a NO answer when the final answer
        is actually NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (there is not enough evidence
        to say High Note was released earlier)" which indicates it cannot determine
        the comparison. This is a case where the model is expressing inability to
        verify the comparison, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative

        as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot confirm..." which
        indicates it cannot determine the comparison, rather than making a definitive

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films were released in
        the same year and month (September 1954), it does not explicitly state this
        equality is the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it gives the NO answer
        with "low confidence due to both films being released in the same month" -
        suggesting uncertainty rather than equality as the primary reason. The model
        actually indicates it cannot determine the exact order due to lack of precise
        dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially expresses uncertainty but then
        provides "NO" as its final answer, even though qualified with low confidence.
        Since it does give an explicit NO answer as its final comparative conclusion,
        this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films were released in
        1954, the NO answer is not given because they were released at the same time.
        Rather, the NO is given because there isn't enough information to determine
        which came first ("cannot verify that one was definitely earlier than the
        other"). The model acknowledges they were released in the same year but explicitly
        states it needs more specific date information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final

        the model notes equal years/months but does not cite this equality as the
        reason for its answer - instead citing insufficient data to determine order.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially indicates it cannot make a determination,
        but when pressed for a YES/NO answer, it explicitly states "NO (but with low
        confidence due to insufficient data to make a definitive determination)".
        Since this NO is explicitly stated as being due to inability to determine
        rather than as a comparative result, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        Instead, it gave NO because it "cannot definitively determine which came first"
        and chose to "err on the side of NO" due to lack of evidence. The equality
        of the month/year was not cited as the primary reason for the NO answer.

        the "NO" part of the response, it wasn't due to equal values but due to inability
        to determine the order.
      explanation_final_answer: The model ends with "NO (I cannot confirm The Black
        Dakotas was released earlier)" which indicates it cannot determine the order.

        Instead, the NO answer is given because the model cannot determine which came
        first within that year due to lacking month/date information. The inability

        answer.

        September 1954, it actually indicates a difference in timing (Romeo and Juliet
        had its festival premiere in early September before The Black Dakotas' general
        release). The NO answer is based on this sequence, not on the releases being
        exactly equal/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO - The Black
        Dakotas was not released earlier than Romeo and Juliet." This is a clear NO

        explicitly states they were released in different months (March vs December)
        and uses this difference as the reason for the NO answer. The values are not
        equal/same, so this is not a case of equal values causing the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 2009 is later than
        2007, showing a clear difference in values, and uses this difference as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        found a specific difference in release months (March vs October) and based
        its NO answer on The Lookout being released first. The NO was not due to equal
        release dates, but because one was explicitly earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Life of the

        23 vs Aug 25), and this difference is the reason for the NO answer, not because
        they were released on the same date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        explicitly found different release dates (August 23 vs August 25) and based
        its NO answer on The Young Doctors being released before Ada. The NO was not
        due to equal values, but due to the opposite ordering being true.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Ada was not
        released earlier than The Young Doctors)" after determining that The Young
        Doctors was released on August 23 while Ada was released on August 25. This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        in 1961, it ultimately gives NO because it found different release dates (August
        25 vs August 23) and determined The Young Doctors was released first. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not because the dates were
        equal.

        first. The NO answer was not due to equal values, but because one was released
        before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that "Ada" was not released earlier than "The Young Doctors"
        since it found specific dates showing "The Young Doctors" was released first.

        dates, with The Young Doctors being released before Ada. The NO answer is
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly explains

        on Ada coming after The Young Doctors, not on them being released at the same
        time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        explicitly states they were released in different months (July vs September)
        and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based on
        this temporal difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that "The V.I.P.s" was released before "In the French Style," directly answering
        whether Parrish's film was released earlier.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states that The Super Cops was released
        in February 1974 while Penda's Fen was released in March 1974, showing a clear
        difference in dates. The NO answer is based on this difference in timing,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that Penda's Fen was not released earlier than The Super Cops, providing a
        direct comparative answer.

        before" Penda's Fen. The NO answer is based on this difference in timing,
        not on equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates

        released in 1974" and bases its NO answer on the fact that they were "released
        in the same year." This equality of release years is the primary reason given
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        identifies a specific difference in timing (early March vs. March 21), making
        them not equal. The NO answer is based on The Super Cops being released first,
        not because the release dates were the same.

        was a difference in timing ("The Super Cops was released earlier in March
        than Penda's Fen"). The NO was not due to equal values, but rather due to
        a detected difference in release dates.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific dates, it shows that
        the films were released on different days (March 21 vs March 20) with The
        Super Cops being one day before. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and explicitly
        concludes "Penda's Fen was NOT released earlier than The Super Cops" after
        comparing specific dates.

        identified different specific release dates (April vs October) and based its
        NO answer on this difference, not on equality. The NO was given because one
        was explicitly earlier than the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Green Hat

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a clear
        difference in release dates (September vs December 2001), not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states one came AFTER the other.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The fact that both
        movies were released in 2001 is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality
        as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly finds that the movies were released in different
        months (September vs October) and uses this difference to conclude that The
        Musketeer was released first.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response

        of the fact that the model noted both films were released in September 1951.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (we cannot confirm...)"
        which indicates it cannot determine the order. This is a case where the model
        is expressing inability to verify/determine, making this an UNKNOWN rather
        than a NO comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the release dates were equal
        - it actually specified that "The River" premiered earlier in September than
        "Fanfares of Love" (September 27). This temporal difference, even though both
        were in September 1951, means the NO wasn't due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Fanfares
        of Love was not released earlier than The River)" making it a clear NO answer
        to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both films were released in
        the same year and same month (September 1951), and this equality of release
        timing is the primary reason given for the NO answer. The model does not indicate
        any difference in timing between the releases.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Fanfares of Love was released earlier than The River.

        explicitly states they were released in different months (September vs October)
        and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based on
        this temporal difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and explains
        that "Fanfares of Love was NOT released earlier than 'The River'" as its comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. In fact, it explicitly stated different release dates (September vs
        October 1951) and used this difference to reach its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after comparing the release dates of the two films, determining that
        "The River" came first rather than "Fanfares of Love".

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1951, the model
        identified specific different months (September vs October) and used this
        difference to reach its conclusion. The NO wasn't based on equal release dates,
        but rather on finding that one was released before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO - Fanfares
        of Love was not released earlier than The River" after comparing the release
        dates. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that one movie was NOT released
        earlier than the other.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that one movie was released
        in 1981 and the other in 1982, showing a clear difference in values. The NO
        appears to be in response to a question about whether the first movie was
        released before the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two movies, where it determined that
        "If You Could See What I Hear" was released later (1982) than "Maria, Mirabela"
        (1981).

        date (1982) is later than the other date (1981), not because the values are
        equal. The model explicitly states "1982 comes after 1981" and concludes NO
        because one is later, not because they're the same.

        in 1986, this wasn't used to give a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a clear

        and based its NO answer on Once More, with Feeling! being released first.
        The NO was not due to equal release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO - Conspiracy
        of Hearts was not released earlier than Once More, with Feeling!" after determining
        that Once More, with Feeling! was released first in February 1960 compared
        to Conspiracy of Hearts in March 1960.

        vs March 1960) and concludes NO because Once More, with Feeling! was released
        first. The values being compared are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Conspiracy of Hearts

        came before Khamoshi (1996), showing different values and using this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        notes both films were released in 1996, this wasn't used to justify a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot determine with certainty which film was released
        earlier" due to lacking specific release dates. This indicates inability to
        make the comparison rather than a refusal to answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE" and
        explains it cannot make a definitive YES/NO determination due to lacking specific
        release date information within 1996. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        however this is irrelevant since the answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a clear

        states that Danger Zone was released before Khamoshi.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        not definitively released earlier"). The model does not indicate any difference
        between the release times.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1968, the model
        explicitly states they were released in different months (March vs April)
        and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based on
        this difference in release dates, not on the dates being equal.

        cannot determine relative timing, rather than stating they were released at
        exactly the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states it "cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" but when forced to choose, gives "NO (but with very low
        confidence)". Since it explicitly states it cannot make a determination due
        to insufficient information about release dates, this should be classified

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - Because I cannot verify that
        Richard Stanley's 'Brave' exists". Since the model rejects the premise by
        stating one of the films doesn't exist, this should be classified as UNKNOWN
        rather than NO.

        this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the model
        never claims the values are equal - it states it cannot verify one of the
        values at all.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does say "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        states it "cannot make a valid comparison" and "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer." It also indicates one of the movies may not exist. The
        NO is given reluctantly with "low confidence" only because it feels forced
        to give a YES/NO answer. This falls under the criteria for UNKNOWN where the
        model rejects premises or indicates it cannot determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in October 2014, the
        model explicitly states there is a difference in dates (October 24 vs October
        10) and concludes NO based on this difference, not because the dates are the
        same. The NO answer is given because one date comes after the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that The Knife That Killed Me was not
        released earlier than Dracula Untold. The answer is definitive and directly
        addresses the comparison.

        between the release dates, with one movie coming after the other. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative conclusion that "The Knife That Killed Me was released after Dracula
        Untold"

        - in fact, it explicitly states that Dracula Untold was released first (October
        10) before The Knife That Killed Me (mid-October). The NO answer is based
        on this difference in timing, not on equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (The Knife That Killed
        Me was not released earlier than Dracula Untold)" and provides a direct comparative
        conclusion based on release dates, with Dracula Untold being released first.

      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 2014, the model
        explicitly states different release dates (October 10 vs October 24) and concludes
        NO based on this difference, not based on the dates being equal. The NO answer
        is because one came after the other, not because they were released at the
        same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that "The Knife That Killed Me" was released after "Dracula

        being earlier, not because they were released on the same date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its comparative
        answer, though it notes uncertainty in making the determination. Since it
        provides a clear NO rather than stating it cannot determine the answer, this
        should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 1992, the model
        explicitly states they were released in different months (April vs May) and
        uses this difference as the reason for the NO answer. The values are not equal,
        and the NO is based on Khuda Gawah being released before Minbo.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether Minbo was released earlier
        than Khuda Gawah. The model provides specific dates and makes a clear determination.

        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model notes they were released in the same year
        but explicitly states it cannot make a determination without exact dates,
        rather than using the equality as the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but qualifies it
        with "since we cannot confirm Awam was released earlier." This indicates the
        model cannot determine the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN rather than
        a definitive NO comparative result.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "CANNOT DETERMINE" due to lacking specific

        but is not presented as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" and reaffirms

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot confirm..." which

    184cc513-353e-4872-802a-87d7935721f7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (2018 vs 2017) and concluding that one is later than the other.
        It does not state the values are equal or the same - in fact, it explicitly
        notes they are different years. The NO is based on the fact that Click & Collect
        came later, not that they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that "Click & Collect was NOT released
        earlier than Autorsha." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    28187ea3-c7ba-495a-a543-38c7ae59c5ba:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in release dates (August 2017 vs December 2018) and gives this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer, not because the dates are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Click & Collect was NOT
        released earlier than Autorsha"
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found a clear
        difference in release dates (August 2018 vs December 2018), not because the
        values were equal. It explicitly states one was released LATER than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, where it determined Click & Collect was
        released later than Autorsha.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        different release dates (December 24, 2018 vs August 10, 2018) and explicitly
        states that August comes before December. The NO is not due to equal values,
        but because it found a difference in dates showing the opposite order.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (Click & Collect was
        not released earlier than Autorsha)" as its final answer, making a direct
        comparative statement.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the final answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in release dates (August vs December 2018) and uses this difference as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and explains
        that Click & Collect was NOT released earlier than Autorsha, providing a direct
        comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one date (2018)
        was later than the other (2017), and this difference in dates was the reason
        for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the release dates, determining that Click & Collect
        (2018) came after Autorsha (2017)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c6903479-dbf9-4c9d-866d-c3031b7ee93d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Autorsha
        was released in August 2017 while Click & Collect was released in December
        2018 - explicitly stating different dates, not equal values. The NO was based
        on Autorsha being released earlier, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and explains
        that Click & Collect was NOT released earlier than Autorsha, providing a direct
        comparative answer.
