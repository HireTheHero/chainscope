    1465cf9e-17ec-4426-b9b5-515a7fca2985:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both films were released in
        1979 ("both films were released in the same year") and this equality in release
        years is the primary reason given for the NO answer. The model doesn't indicate
        any difference between the release dates, only that more specific timing information
        (months) would be needed to determine which came first.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer is: NO" after
        explaining that both films were released in 1979 and that without month information,
        neither can be definitively stated as being released earlier.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    20c54e73-a249-4b65-a65a-5fb9fc0c1064:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both movies were released in
        the same year" and this equality of release years (1979) is the primary reason
        given for the NO answer. While it mentions some uncertainty about specific
        dates, the NO answer is explicitly based on the fact that they were released
        in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it notes some uncertainty about specific dates within
        the year. Since it provides a clear NO as its comparative conclusion, this
        should be classified as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    64bc8f9a-ac44-49bc-9486-6bf4f607a764:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "both films were
        released in the same year, 1979" and this equality is the primary reason given
        for the NO answer ("neither film was released earlier than the other based
        solely on the year"). The NO answer is directly based on the values being
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing it as a clear, direct response after analyzing the release
        years.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    798b9c82-7692-4d81-801b-9944f05ebe01:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. While the model did note
        the years were the same (1979), this is irrelevant since we only evaluate
        equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we cannot determine the earlier
        release without further details)" which indicates it cannot make the determination.
        This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot verify/determine
        the answer, so it should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    7eac4231-dec7-438d-ab31-eea398cd27aa:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Both movies were released in
        1979" and concludes NO specifically because "neither was released earlier
        than the other" due to them being released in the same year. The equality
        of the release years is explicitly stated and is the primary reason given
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the release years.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    96a0c8bb-0550-4342-8baa-765083e89883:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons made in the
        response
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, 'Rope and
        Skin' was released earlier than 'Unidentified Flying Oddball'" after comparing
        specific release dates (February 10 vs July 26, 1979)
      final_answer: 'YES'

    acaf3292-d51e-4b7f-8027-95dc2fbc955d:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both movies were released in
        the same year" and concludes NO specifically because "neither was released
        earlier than the other" - explicitly basing the NO answer on their equal release
        dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to the question
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    cb8f4989-dc01-4215-aa75-99a2942c30d6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. While the model did
        note the years were the same (1979), this is irrelevant since we only evaluate
        equality as the reason for a NO answer when the final answer is actually NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot definitively say..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the answer due to lack of specific release
        date information. This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot
        make the determination, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative
        result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    daeae8da-f5d4-417c-b853-7f706225c7a1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. While the model did
        note both films were from 1979, this is irrelevant since we only evaluate
        equality as the reason for a NO answer when the final answer is actually NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot confirm" which indicates
        inability to determine the answer rather than a comparative result. This is
        a case where the model is expressing uncertainty about making the comparison
        due to incomplete information (lacking specific release dates), making this
        an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    dfafdb8e-06a3-4e18-a45f-731e1b185a83:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both films were released
        in the same year (1979) and uses this equality as the primary reason for its
        NO answer, stating "they were both released in 1979." While it mentions that
        specific release dates aren't available, the equality of the release years
        is presented as the decisive factor for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the release dates, providing a clear comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both films were released in
        the same year" (1981) and this equality is the primary basis for its NO answer.
        While it mentions not having specific release dates, the equal release years
        are explicitly cited as the reason for the negative comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it notes uncertainty about specific release dates within
        the year. Since it provides a clear NO as its comparative conclusion, this
        should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    2680f65c-0ad8-4282-a7a3-76c16085075c:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both films were released in
        1981 and explicitly uses this equality as the basis for its NO answer, noting
        it cannot determine which came first because they were released in the same
        year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this is a direct comparative result based on the information it
        analyzed about release dates.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    278cdecb-1cac-4424-81b6-03ae76166701:

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states "Both films were released
        in the same year, 1981. Therefore, neither was released earlier than the other"
        and this equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" after
        determining both films were released in 1981. This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.'

    6f055fb2-b8e6-400a-b3ab-54e1857d3bc2:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both films were released
        in the same year (1981) and uses this equality as the primary reason for its
        NO answer. While it mentions that more specific date information could be
        needed, the equality of the release years is presented as the main basis for
        the NO response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release years.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    7b9d2a2d-fb9a-460c-92f7-8bcaf35a15d7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. While the model did note
        that both films were released in the same year (1981), this is irrelevant
        since we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, based on the information provided,
        we cannot definitively say..." This is effectively stating an inability to
        determine the comparison, not a comparative NO. When a model says it cannot
        determine or verify something, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    92f99440-36cd-409d-ab5b-1adc62478252:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal - the model
        found different release dates (February vs December 1981).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Thus, the answer
        is YES" after comparing the release dates of the two movies.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states "Both films were released
        in the same year, 1981. Therefore, neither was released earlier than the other"
        and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer to the question
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after determining both films were released
        in 1981.'

    d2eaf897-1caa-42bc-aecc-45e198a8321e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model notes both films were released in the same year, this wasn't used
        as the basis for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO; we cannot determine with certainty
        from the given information." This is a case where the model explicitly states
        it cannot make the determination, which falls under our UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    f9896c99-b389-4001-ab25-46c4abd0c76e:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both films were released
        in the same year (1981), and this equality is the primary reason given for
        the NO answer ("Since both films were released in the same year, 1981, neither
        film was released earlier than the other").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining both films were released in 1981.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "both films were
        released in the same year, 1981" and this equality is the primary reason given
        for the NO answer ("Since both films were released in the same year... neither
        was released earlier").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the release dates, making this a clear NO response.

    183bd750-4ffe-4af1-a3cb-c521afba1a16:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Both films were released in
        1998" and concludes NO specifically because "neither was released earlier
        than the other in terms of the year." The NO answer is directly based on the
        equality of the release years, with no differences noted.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer when comparing the release dates. While it notes uncertainty about
        specific dates within the year, it provides a clear NO based on the year-level
        comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    48e026e1-560b-4471-bcd9-50e8a739fdc8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model notes both films were released in the same year, this wasn't used
        to justify a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" and explains it cannot determine which was released earlier
        without specific release dates, even though both were released in 1998.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    8fae7d3d-728b-4172-9d86-b81cc2f94359:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the release dates were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO appears to indicate it cannot make the determination due to missing
        information (specific release date), rather than a comparative result. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where "The model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison."
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    99067ac4-1215-4281-8ae7-bc8012acf3a0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the release dates were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their
        relative order due to incomplete information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        it cannot determine/confirm the answer due to insufficient date information.
        This makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    a738701a-8605-4be3-bc2a-3e7a238ebe58:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (February
        12 vs March 8).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after determining that Thulli Thirintha Kaalam was released
        earlier than Silencing Mary.

      result: 'YES'
    b8bd09bc-e44f-49c4-b0d3-b2559444a4ab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model notes they have the same year but explicitly
        states it lacks more detailed timing information rather than declaring them
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (as we cannot confirm one was
        definitively released earlier than the other with the given data)." Since
        this is explicitly stating they cannot determine the answer rather than making
        a comparative conclusion, this should be classified as UNKNOWN. The model
        is indicating inability to verify rather than making a comparative determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    c7a8f54c-e5c8-42cd-b249-96ad9309e82d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different dates (March
        8 vs March 12) and indicates that "Silencing Mary was released earlier than
        Thulli Thirintha Kaalam." Therefore, the NO answer was based on a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, where it found that Silencing Mary was
        released on March 8, 1998, while Thulli Thirintha Kaalam was released on March
        12, 1998.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        did not claim the release dates were equal - it stated one date was unknown
        beyond the year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot conclusively say..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information
        about one of the release dates. This is a case where the model explicitly
        states it cannot make the determination, so it should be classified as UNKNOWN
        rather than NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    d3e4c4cf-94fa-41cd-bf2a-21e4e3b7e21a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer was NO, this wasn't
        because the release dates were equal. In fact, the model suggests a difference
        in timing, inferring that "Silencing Mary" was likely released earlier. The
        NO answer was given because the model concluded that Thulli Thirintha Kaalam
        was not released earlier than Silencing Mary.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 'Thulli Thirintha
        Kaalam' was not released earlier than 'Silencing Mary'" as a comparative result.
        While the model acknowledges some uncertainty in the exact dates, it still
        provides a definitive NO answer based on its reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ffa97671-fed0-453c-a2e3-35c5771eda70:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the release dates are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it notes that while both are from 1998, one has a specific date (March
        8) while the other lacks a specific date. The NO answer is based on the inability
        to verify an earlier date, not on equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 'Thulli Thirintha
        Kaalam' was not released earlier than 'Silencing Mary.'" This is a clear NO
        comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        it lacks information to determine relative ordering, rather than using the
        equality as the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining it cannot make the comparison due to both films being released

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False per the criteria, regardless of the model
        noting both films were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        say YES or NO" due to having only year-level information without specific
        release dates. This indicates inability to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. While the model does note
        that both films were released in the same year (1950), this is irrelevant
        to the classification since the final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we cannot determine a clear
        YES without specific dates)". Since this indicates inability to determine
        the comparison due to lack of specific dates, this should be classified as
        UNKNOWN rather than NO. The parenthetical clarification shows this is actually
        expressing uncertainty rather than a definitive comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly found different release dates (March vs
        November 1950) and gave NO because "The Glass Castle" was released earlier,
        not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that "The Glass Castle" was released in March 1950 while
        "The West Point Story" was released in November 1950.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal. In fact, it explicitly states that while both movies were released
        in 1950, they had different specific release dates (July 17 vs November 24),
        with "The Glass Castle" being released before "The West Point Story".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model did note both films were released in the same year (1950), this
        is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot say 'The West Point
        Story' was released earlier" and explicitly indicates it cannot determine
        the order due to needing more specific release date information. This is a
        case where the model indicates it cannot make the determination, which falls
        under the UNKNOWN criteria.

        at the same time. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (March
        27, 2003 vs April 4, 2003) and uses this difference to justify its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Sibi Malayil's Ente
        Veedu Appuvinteyum was not released earlier than Gregor Jordan's Ned Kelly"
        after determining specific release dates and making a direct comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. While the model did note both films
        were released in the same year, this wasn't used to give a definitive NO answer
        - rather, it led to the model stating it couldn't determine the order.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot determine from the
        given data which film was released earlier" - this is explicitly indicating
        an inability to make the determination, not a comparative result. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN category as the model is stating it cannot verify/determine
        the comparison.

        note both films were released in 2003, this is irrelevant since the final
        answer wasn't classified as NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we cannot definitively say...)"
        which indicates it cannot determine the order. This is a case where the model
        explicitly states it cannot verify or determine the comparison, making it
        an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative result.

        NO answer, stating "since both movies were released in the same year... neither
        film was released earlier than the other in terms of year."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it notes this is based on same-year release dates. While it mentions
        uncertainty about specific dates, it still provides NO as its definitive comparative
        answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. While it initially noted both movies were released in 2010, it then
        found different specific release dates (September 9 vs October 15) and gave

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had considered
        the final statement as a NO answer, it would still be False because the model
        explicitly states different release dates (September 1 vs October 15, 2010)
        rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO, Dean Parisot's
        'Red' was not released earlier than Giada Colagrande's 'A Woman.'" However,
        in the analysis, the model points out that Dean Parisot didn't direct the
        first "Red" movie (it was Robert Schwentke), so this effectively rejects the
        premise of the question. Since the model is comparing a movie that wasn't
        actually directed by Dean Parisot, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    25200e79-928e-421a-aad5-e6bfd67b7c94:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "A Woman" was released on March
        2, 2010, while "Red" was released on October 15, 2010, showing they have different
        release dates. The NO appears to be given because "A Woman" was released earlier
        than "Red", not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two movies. This is a clear comparative
        answer.

        explicitly states different specific release dates (October 15 vs September
        2) and bases its NO answer on "A Woman" being released earlier, not on the
        dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" after
        determining that "A Woman" was released earlier than "Red", not the other
        way around as asked in the question.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2, regardless of the
        fact that the model noted the years were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot determine a
        clear YES or NO answer" and indicates it lacks sufficient information to make
        the comparison since both films were released in the same year. This is a
        case where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

        the model did note both movies were released in 2010, this wasn't used to
        give a definitive NO answer, but rather to explain why it couldn't determine
        the order.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot determine" which indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to lack of specific release dates. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN category as per the criteria since it explicitly states
        inability to determine the comparison.

        values (2013 vs 2010) and explicitly states that 2010 is earlier than 2013.
        The NO is not due to equal values but due to one date being later than the
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer to the question
        is NO" and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Dean Parisot's "Red"
        was not released earlier than "A Woman"

        bases its NO answer on A Woman being released earlier than Red, not on them
        being released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        its NO answer. The model doesn't indicate any difference in timing within
        2010, just that they were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        earlier than the other based solely on the year." The NO answer is directly
        based on the equality of release years.

        released earlier in the year than Branded to Kill" and provides different
        dates (February 3 vs June 15, 1967). The NO answer is based on this difference,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, while
        the model noted both films were released in 1977, this wasn't used to justify
        a NO answer - rather, the uncertainty about exact release dates was the focus.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (as we cannot confirm
        it was released earlier)" which indicates inability to determine the comparison
        rather than a definitive comparative result. This is effectively stating "NO,
        I cannot verify" which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        other based solely on the year." The NO is directly based on the values being
        the same.

        evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, it cannot be definitively stated..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the order. This is a case where the model

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal. While it notes both films were released in 1962, it specifically determines
        that Salvatore Giuliano was released earlier (February vs June), and this
        difference in timing is the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states different release dates (February 2
        vs June 6, 1962) and uses this difference to reach its conclusion
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films were released in
        1962, it identifies specific different release dates (February 28 vs June
        15) and gives NO because Salvatore Giuliano was released first, not because
        the dates were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, where it determined that Salvatore Giuliano
        was released before Nine Days in One Year.

        False according to the criteria. The values being compared (January vs February
        1962) were not equal anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1962, the model
        explicitly noted a difference in release dates (February vs June) and used
        this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO wasn't based on the values
        being equal - in fact, it was based on them being different.

        at the same time. Instead, it explicitly states they were released at different
        times (February vs June 1962) and uses this difference as the reason for its
        NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. While the model did note
        the years were the same (1962), this is irrelevant since we only evaluate
        equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot conclusively say..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the answer rather than making a comparative
        conclusion. This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot verify/determine
        the answer.

        2 vs June 1, 1962) and states that Salvatore Giuliano was released earlier
        than Nine Days in One Year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1962, the model
        explicitly states different months (February vs June) and uses this difference
        to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is not based on the films being released
        at the same time, but rather because one was released before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that Salvatore Giuliano was released in February 1962
        while Nine Days in One Year was released in June 1962. This is a direct NO
        answer to whether the first film was released earlier than the second.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states both films were released in the same
        year (1955) and this equality is the primary reason for its NO answer. The
        model explicitly uses this equality as the basis for concluding neither was
        released earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explaining that neither film was released earlier than the other. While it
        notes uncertainty about specific dates within 1955, it provides a clear NO
        as its comparative conclusion.

        the model did note both films were released in 1955, this is irrelevant since
        the final answer wasn't classified as NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot determine" and explains
        it cannot make the comparison due to lack of specific release dates within
        1955. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the determination,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        for its NO answer. The model indicates it cannot determine which came first
        precisely because they were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, based on the information

        earlier than the other" - indicating equality is the primary reason for the
        NO answer.

        determine if one was earlier than the other. The NO answer appears to be based
        on this equality of release years, making this a case where the values being
        compared are stated to be the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it earlier suggests the question cannot be answered definitively.

        it determines specific release dates (August 19 vs September 16) and gives
        NO because Quest for Love was actually released earlier. The values being
        compared are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically saying "NO, Duccio Tessari's 'The Bloodstained Butterfly' was

        9 vs August 19, 1971) and used this difference to reach its conclusion. The
        NO was because the comparison went in the opposite direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        that year, instead specifically basing its NO answer on them being "released
        in the same year."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

        in the same year (1993), it does not give a NO answer because they are equal
        - rather, it gives a NO answer because it found that Fight Back to School
        III was released earlier (January vs October). The values being compared (release
        dates) are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 'East Wind' was not
        released earlier than 'Fight Back to School III'" after determining specific

        equality as a reason for NO when the final answer is classified as NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explains this is because
        it cannot determine which was released earlier due to having only year-level
        data. This is effectively stating it cannot make the comparison, which meets
        the criteria for UNKNOWN. The "NO" here is qualified with inability to determine,

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (We cannot definitively say one
        was released earlier than the other without specific release dates)". Since
        this is explicitly stating an inability to determine the comparison, this
        should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO. The parenthetical explanation

        wasn't classified as NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO appears to be given because it cannot determine which was released
        earlier, not as a comparative result. Since the model states "we cannot determine
        the exact release dates within the year to definitively say which was released
        earlier," this is effectively stating it cannot make the comparison, which

        after the other (June 14 vs June 12), showing a difference in dates. The NO
        answer was given because the chronological order was opposite to what was
        being asked.

        would be needed, the equality of the release years is presented as the main
        reason for the negative comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it notes uncertainty about specific release dates. Since
        it provides a clear NO as its comparative conclusion, we classify this as
        NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        a negative comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        it cannot establish which film was released earlier, since they were both
        released in 1962. Since this is expressing uncertainty about the comparison
        rather than making a definitive comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        a reason for NO answers when the final answer is classified as NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO appears to be indicating it cannot determine the comparison rather
        than a comparative result. The explanation makes it clear that "we cannot
        determine which was released earlier" due to lack of specific dates. This

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. While the model notes
        both films were released in the same year, this is irrelevant since the final
        answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot definitively determine
        which came first without specific release dates, making this an UNKNOWN response.
        While it identifies both films were released in 1974, it explicitly states
        it needs more specific date information to make a determination.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Paappi Devataa was released earlier than Widows' Peak,

        the values were equal. Instead, it found that the films were released in different
        years (1994 vs 1995) and the order was opposite to what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, where it found that Widows' Peak (1994)
        was released before Paappi Devataa (1995), not the other way around.

        1994, showing a difference in values. The NO answer was given because one
        value was greater than the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically concluding that "Paappi Devataa" was not released earlier than
        "Widows' Peak." This is a direct comparative NO answer.

        Instead, the NO is explained as being due to lack of specific date information
        to determine which came first. The model is not saying NO because they're
        definitely the same, but because it can't determine the order.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it explains this is due to lack of specific dates to make the
        determination. Since the NO is given as a comparative result (not being able
        to say one came before the other), rather than rejecting the premise or indicating
        inability to verify, this counts as a NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies in

        were released in the same year (1966), and this equality is the primary reason
        given for the negative answer. The model explicitly states "since they were
        released in the same year" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        in 1984 and the other in 1985, showing a clear difference in values. The NO
        was given because one film came before the other, not because they were released
        in the same year.

        (1984 vs 1985) and concluded NO because Parama was released earlier, not because
        the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        one film was released in 1984 and the other in 1985, showing a clear difference
        in dates. The NO was given because the chronological order was opposite to
        what was asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that Parama (1984) was released before Paartha Gnabagam
        Illayo (1985). This is a direct NO answer to whether the first film was released

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed different years (1985
        vs 1984) and the NO was because one film came after the other, not because
        they were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that "Paartha Gnabagam Illayo" was

      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted that both films were released
        in 1978, it did not give a NO answer because they were equal - it gave a NO
        answer because it found that La Zizanie was released in April while Germany
        in Autumn was released later in October. The NO was based on this difference
        in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, 'Germany
        in Autumn' was not released earlier than 'La Zizanie'" after determining that
        La Zizanie was released in April 1978 while Germany in Autumn premiered in

        were equal. The model explicitly states that "La Zizanie was released earlier
        in the year than Germany in Autumn."

        but explicitly states it lacks information to determine relative timing, rather
        than claiming equality as the reason for the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation indicates it cannot determine which was released earlier
        due to lacking specific release dates. Since the model states it "cannot conclusively
        say" and lacks information to make the determination, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" at the end.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we cannot definitively say...)"
        which indicates it cannot determine the order. This is a case where the model

        when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. While the model did note
        the years were the same (2017), this is irrelevant since we only evaluate
        the equal values criteria when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we cannot conclusively say that
        one was released earlier than the other without more specific release date
        information)". Since this is explicitly stating an inability to determine
        the comparison due to lack of specific dates, this should be classified as
        UNKNOWN rather than NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially notes both films were released
        in 2017, it then identifies specific different release dates (January 26 vs
        February 3, 2017). The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not
        on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response. The NO answer is given as a direct comparative result
        after determining that The Yuppie Fantasia 3 was released on January 26, while
        Mehandi Laga Ke Rakhna was released on February 3.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. The model explicitly states different
        release dates (February 14, 2017 vs November 3, 2017) and indicates that one
        film was released earlier than the other. The NO answer was based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is NO" after determining that "The Yuppie Fantasia 3" was released
        earlier than "Mehandi Laga Ke Rakhna." This is an explicit NO answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both films were released in
        2017 ("the same year") and explicitly uses this equality as the reason for
        its NO answer. The model does not indicate any difference between the release
        times, only that it lacks more specific date information within that same
        year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion, providing a clear comparative answer. While it mentions
        uncertainty about specific dates, it definitively gives NO as its answer based
        on the same release year.

        NO), this automatically results in False. While the model does note both films
        were released in the same year, this wasn't used to give a NO answer - rather
        it was used to explain why a determination couldn't be made without more specific
        dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that "a definitive YES
        or NO cannot be provided without those specific dates" and indicates it cannot
        determine the answer without more detailed release date information. This
        is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes by saying there's no clear YES/NO
        answer due to both being released in the same year, but then suggests defaulting
        to NO due to lack of specific timing information. This makes the final position

        to determine the release order. The equality of years is mentioned but is
        not the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer, and
        provides this as a comparative result based on insufficient information to

        released in the same year... it would be NO, because both films were released
        in the same year").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "it would be NO,

        are "considered to have been released simultaneously in terms of ordering."
        The equality of release years is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing it as a direct comparative result based on the release years

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both movies were released
        in 1961, it finds specific release dates that are different (July 19 vs August
        25) and bases its NO answer on "The Young Doctors" being released earlier.
        The NO is not due to equal values, but due to a clear difference in dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        "The Young Doctors" was released earlier than "Ada"
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model states both films were released in 1961
        and uses this equality as the basis for its NO answer. While it mentions that
        specific release dates within 1961 could theoretically differ, it bases its
        NO answer primarily on the fact that both films were released in the same
        year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 'Ada' was not released
        earlier than 'The Young Doctors'" as its final answer. While it acknowledges

        in 1961, it does not give a NO answer because they were equal - it gives a
        NO answer because it found The Young Doctors was released in July while Ada
        was released in August, indicating a clear difference in release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 'Ada' was
        not released earlier than 'The Young Doctors'" after determining that The
        Young Doctors was released in July while Ada was released in August of the
        same year.

        equal years (1961), this is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality as
        reason for NO when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we cannot definitively say...)"
        which indicates it cannot determine the comparison. This is a case where the
        model explicitly states it cannot verify/determine the answer, making this
        an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative result.

        gives a NO answer because it found The Young Doctors was released earlier
        (July 19 vs August 25). The NO is based on finding a difference in release

        be needed for a more detailed comparison, the equality of the release years
        is presented as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model states both films were released in 1974
        (the same year) and this equality is the primary basis for its NO answer.
        The model explicitly states "both films were released in the same year" and
        uses this as the reason it cannot confirm one was earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it notes this is due to inability to confirm the ordering with only
        year-level data. Since the model gives a clear NO as its comparative result
        (rather than just saying it cannot determine), this counts as a NO answer
        rather than UNKNOWN.

        in the same year (1974), this is irrelevant since the final answer wasn't
        classified as NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO appears to be in response to whether one can determine if one
        was released before the other, rather than as a direct comparative result.
        Since the model indicates it "cannot definitively say" which was released
        first, this is effectively stating it cannot make the determination.

        cannot be said to be earlier than the other, leading to the NO answer. The
        model does not indicate any difference between the release timing, only their
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        both films were released in 1974. While it mentions needing more specific

        since the final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we cannot answer with
        a clear YES or NO" and indicates it cannot determine the order due to lacking
        specific release dates within 2004. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

        release dates (February 26 vs June 12, 2004), not because the values were
        equal. While it noted they were released in the same year, this wasn't the

        dates, making the answer inconclusive. While it mentions that "if we assume
        we are only considering the year of release, then the answer would be NO,"
        this hypothetical doesn't override the model's explicit statement that a definitive

        Hearts' was released earlier" and indicates it cannot determine the order
        without specific release dates. This is a case where the model explicitly
        states it cannot make the determination, making this an UNKNOWN response rather
        than a definitive NO comparative result.

        It explicitly states "the question does not have a definitive YES or NO answer"

        was released earlier than "Bandhan" (not the other way around as presumably
        asked in the original question).

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both films were released in
        the same year (1998), but this is not presented as the reason for the NO answer.
        Instead, the NO answer is given because the model cannot determine which came
        first without more specific release dates. The equality of years is noted
        but is not presented as the reason for the negative comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with clear reasoning that it cannot determine which was released earlier since
        they were both released in 1998. While the model expresses uncertainty about
        exact dates, it provides a definitive "NO" answer to whether one was released
        earlier than the other.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "Brave" was never released,
        making a comparison impossible. While it ends with "NO", this is a case where
        the model rejects the premise of the question since one film doesn't exist/wasn't

        values - it was indicating that one of the items in the comparison could not
        be verified to exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model indicates that one of the films ("Brave"
        by Richard Stanley) does not appear to exist or have a recognized release,
        making the comparison impossible. While the model states "NO" at the end,
        this is a case where the model is rejecting the premises of the question since

        did not give a NO answer based on equal values - it expressed inability to
        verify the comparison due to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot confirm..." which
        indicates inability to determine/verify the comparison rather than a definitive
        comparative result. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as per the criteria
        since the model indicates it cannot make the determination due to lack of
        data about one of the films.

        the model never claimed the release dates were equal - it actually indicated
        one film might not have a release date at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with an explicit "NO" but bases
        this on uncertainty about one of the films and assumptions about unreleased
        projects, effectively indicating it cannot make a proper comparison. This
        makes it a case where the model rejects the premises of the question (one
        film may not exist/be released), which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

        the final answer as NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explains this is because
        it "cannot ascertain" which was released earlier. This is effectively stating

        were released in the same month is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality
        as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "a clear YES or NO cannot
        be provided without specific day information" and explains that it cannot
        make a definitive determination since both films were released in the same
        month. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that while both films were released
        in 1992, Khuda Gawah was released on May 8 and Minbo on May 15, finding a
        clear difference in dates. The NO answer is based on this difference in release
        dates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" after

        year but explicitly states it needs more specific dates to determine the order,
        not that they were released on the same date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation indicates it cannot determine which was released first
        without exact dates. Since the model states it "can't definitively say" and
        lacks information to make the comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN
        despite the "NO" at the end.

        earlier than Minbo.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        it mentions that more specific dates would be needed for a definitive comparison,
        the sameness of the release years is presented as the primary reason for the

        on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 'Awam' was not released

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it notes uncertainty about specific release dates within

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly found that one
        date (November 23, 2018) was earlier than the other (December 24, 2018), and
        this difference in dates was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates, where it found
        that Autorsha was released before Click & Collect.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (November 23, 2018 vs December 24, 2018) and explicitly states
        that one was released earlier than the other. It is not based on the values
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films, providing a direct comparative
        conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        release dates (November 23, 2018 vs December 24, 2018), not because the values
        were equal. The model explicitly states that "Autorsha" was released earlier
        than "Click & Collect."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, where it found that Autorsha was released
        earlier than Click & Collect (not the other way around).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that one date (November 23, 2018) is earlier
        than the other date (December 24, 2018). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is: NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. While the model did
        note both films were released in 2018, this wasn't used to give a definitive
        NO answer, but rather to explain why it couldn't determine the order.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot definitively say..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the order. This is a case where the model
        explicitly states it cannot verify/determine the comparison, making it an
        UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

        that "Autorsha was released earlier than Click & Collect." The NO answer was
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films and determining that Autorsha
        was released earlier than Click & Collect.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it was because Autorsha was released earlier
        than Click & Collect, showing different dates (November 23 vs December 24,
        2018)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, where it found that Autorsha (Nov 23, 2018)
        was released before Click & Collect (Dec 24, 2018)

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly found that the dates were different (November
        23, 2018 vs December 24, 2018) and used this difference to reach its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. The model explicitly states that Autorsha
        was released on November 23, 2018, while Click & Collect was released on December
        24, 2018, and the NO answer was given because Autorsha was released before
        Click & Collect.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" after
        comparing release dates and finding that Autorsha was released before Click
        & Collect. This is an explicit NO answer to a comparative question.
