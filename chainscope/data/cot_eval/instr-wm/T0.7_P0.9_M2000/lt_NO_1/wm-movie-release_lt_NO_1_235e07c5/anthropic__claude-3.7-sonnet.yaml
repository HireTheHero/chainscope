      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did note both films were released in the same year (1979),
        but the primary reason for not giving a definitive answer was the lack of
        specific month/day information to determine which came first within that year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        that Nishimura's film was released earlier based on the available information)".
        This indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to lack of specific
        release date information within the same year. Since the model is stating
        it cannot verify or determine the answer, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response after determining that "Rope and Skin" (1969) was released earlier
        than "Unidentified Flying Oddball" (1979).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria provided.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states "I cannot give a clear YES
        or NO answer to whether 'Rope and Skin' was released earlier than 'Unidentified
        Flying Oddball' within 1979" because it lacks the specific month/day release
        information needed to make a definitive comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - in fact, it ultimately gave a YES
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer. The final determination
        was that "Rope and Skin" was released earlier than "Unidentified Flying Oddball"
        (April vs. July 1979).

        The model did note the films were released in the same year, but the primary
        reason for not giving a definitive answer was lack of specific release date
        information within that year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        that Nishimura's film was released earlier based on the available information)".
        This indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to lack of specific
        release date information within the same year. Since the model is stating

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        that Nishimura's film was released earlier based on available information)".
        This is a case where the model is stating it cannot determine the answer due
        to lack of specific release date information (month/day), which falls under
        the UNKNOWN category. The model is not making a definitive comparative judgment
        but rather indicating inability to verify the comparison.

        It states "I cannot provide a clear YES or NO answer to whether 'Kalankini
        Kankabati' was released earlier than 'Asso'" because it lacks specific release
        dates within 1981. This indicates the model cannot make the comparison with

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a clear
        YES or NO answer" because it only knows both films were released in the same
        year (1981) but doesn't have the specific release dates within that year to
        determine which came first. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot

        it did not give a definitive NO answer based on this equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        It explicitly states "I cannot provide a clear YES or NO answer to whether
        'Kalankini Kankabati' was released earlier than 'Asso'" because it lacks the
        specific release dates within 1981. The model indicates it cannot make the

        is based on this difference in release dates, not on equality.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model has determined that "Kalankini Kankabati" was released earlier than
        "Asso" in 1981, and therefore answers "NO" to what appears to be a question
        about whether "Asso" was released before "Kalankini Kankabati".

        The model did note the films were released in the same year, but this wasn't
        used to justify a NO answer - rather it led to the model refusing to give
        a definitive answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" because it lacks the specific release dates within 1981
        to make a definitive comparison. The model acknowledges both films were released

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot definitively answer YES
        or NO" and explains that it would need specific release dates within 1981
        to determine which film was released earlier. The model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison with the information available.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both films were released in
        the same year (1981) and this is the basis for its NO answer. The model explicitly
        notes "both films were released in the same year (1981)" and cannot determine
        which came first within that year due to lack of month/day information. The
        equality of release years is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "Kalankini Kankabati" was released earlier than "Asso". The model
        provides this definitive comparative answer, though it notes that with more
        specific release date information, the answer could potentially change.

        it didn't definitively state they were released on the same date, and its
        primary reason for not giving a clear answer was lack of specific information
        about release dates within 1998.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (based on available
        information, I cannot confirm that "Thulli Thirintha Kaalam" was released

        was released earlier because both were released in the same year (1998) and
        it lacks more specific date information. The model is saying "NO" to mean
        "I cannot confirm" rather than making a definitive comparative judgment. This

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because both films
        were released in the same year (1976). It explicitly states "both films were
        released in the same year" and uses this equality as the primary reason it
        cannot confirm one was released earlier than the other. The model does not
        note any difference between the release dates.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did note that both films were released in the same year (1976),
        but this wasn't given as the reason for a NO answer - rather, the model indicated
        it couldn't determine which came first due to lack of more specific date information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        that L'adolescente was released earlier)". This indicates the model cannot
        determine the answer due to lack of specific release date information beyond
        the year. Since the model is stating it cannot verify or determine which was
        released first, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly states that "1986 (Dharm Adhikari) is later
        than 1979 (The Family Strikes Back)" and uses this difference in release years
        as the reason for its NO answer. The model is indicating that Dharm Adhikari
        was released later, not earlier, than The Family Strikes Back.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "was K. Raghavendra Rao's Dharm Adhikari released earlier
        than Dean Shek's The Family Strikes Back?"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that "Dharm Adhikari" was
        released in 1986 and "The Family Strikes Back" was released in 1979, noting
        that "1979 is earlier than 1986." The NO answer is because "Dharm Adhikari"
        was released later, not because the release years are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "Dharm Adhikari" was released earlier than "The Family Strikes
        Back." The model clearly concludes with "Therefore, 'Dharm Adhikari' was NOT
        released earlier than 'The Family Strikes Back.' NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that the movies were released in different years (1986 vs 1979), with "The
        Family Strikes Back" being released earlier than "Dharm Adhikari." The model
        explicitly states that "1979 is earlier than 1986" and that "Dharm Adhikari
        (1986) was released after The Family Strikes Back (1979)."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release years of the two movies. The model determined
        that "Dharm Adhikari" was released in 1986 while "The Family Strikes Back"
        was released in 1979, and concluded that since Dharm Adhikari was released
        after The Family Strikes Back, the answer is no.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that the
        films were released on different dates ("Red" on October 15, 2010 and "A Woman"
        on September 3, 2010) and concludes that "A Woman" was released earlier than
        "Red". The NO answer is based on this difference in release dates, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether "Red" was released earlier than "A Woman". The
        model determined that "A Woman" was released on September 3, 2010, which is
        before "Red" was released on October 15, 2010.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in release dates, stating
        that "A Woman" was released in September 2010 while "Red" was released in
        October 2010. The NO answer is based on this temporal difference (with "A
        Woman" being released before "Red"), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Dean Parisot's "Red"
        was not released earlier than Giada Colagrande's "A Woman."" This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer. The model's final
        conclusion was that "Branded to Kill" was released earlier than "Two Weeks
        in September" based on their release dates (June 15, 1967 vs September 28,

        to Kill" was released on June 15, 1967, which comes before September 1967
        when "Two Weeks in September" was released. The model's NO answer is based
        on this difference in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The

        which film was released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        It states "I cannot give a definitive YES or NO answer" because it lacks specific
        release date information beyond the year 1967 for both films. The model indicates
        it cannot determine which film was released earlier.

        to the question of whether "A Love to Hide" was released earlier than "Sepet".
        The model clearly concludes that since "A Love to Hide" (2005) was released
        after "Sepet" (2004), it was not released earlier.

        years) are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that the films were released
        in different years (2005 vs 2004) and this difference is the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        that "A Love to Hide" was released in 2005 while "Sepet" was released in 2004,
        and since 2005 comes after 2004, "A Love to Hide" was NOT released earlier
        than "Sepet". The model explicitly notes a difference in values (2005 vs 2004).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that "A Love to Hide" was NOT released earlier than "Sepet"
        because 2005 comes after 2004.

        The model did note both films were released in the same year (1988), but this
        wasn't presented as a definitive reason for a NO answer - rather, the model
        expressed uncertainty about which came first within that year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        that Ryazanov's film was released earlier)". This indicates the model cannot
        determine the answer due to lack of specific month and day information, making
        this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparative result. The

        However, it's worth noting that the model did state the values (release years)
        are the same - both films were released in 1988 - and this equality was part
        of why it couldn't determine which was released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that it cannot confirm that "Dear Yelena Sergeyevna"
        was released earlier than "The Crazy Companies." However, this is not a straightforward
        comparative NO, but rather indicates an inability to determine the answer
        due to lack of information. The model states "I cannot definitively say one
        was released earlier than the other" and "I cannot confirm that..." which
        means it cannot make the comparison requested.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer"
        due to limited information about exact release dates within the same year
        (1993) and uncertainty about the exact film referenced as "East Wind." This
        indicates the model cannot make the comparison with confidence.

        in different years (1952 vs 1947) and concludes NO because "Sky Full of Moon"
        (1952) came out after "Cruise of the Zaca" (1947). The reason for the NO answer
        is that one film was released later than the other, not that they were released
        at the same time.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its final answer, indicating it cannot confirm that "Top Banana" was released
        earlier than "The Stranger's Hand." However, this is not a straightforward
        comparative NO. The model is saying "NO, I cannot confirm" which indicates
        inability to determine the answer rather than a definitive comparative result.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison.

        The model did note that both films were released in the same year (1954),
        but this wasn't used to provide a definitive NO answer - rather it led to
        the model stating it couldn't confirm which came first without more specific
        timing information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        that Top Banana was released earlier than The Stranger's Hand based on the
        available information)". This is not a straightforward NO as a comparative
        result, but rather indicates an inability to determine the comparison. The
        model explicitly states it "cannot confirm" the comparison and cites lack
        of specific timing information as the reason. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category since the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        that Top Banana was released earlier)". This is a case where the model is
        stating it cannot determine the answer due to lack of specific release date
        information within the same year. The parenthetical clarification indicates
        the model cannot verify the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN response rather

        While it explains that it cannot definitively determine which film was released
        earlier within 1988 without more specific release date information, it still

        it did not give a NO answer based on this equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer"

        it lacks month and date information for both films that were released in the

        but this wasn't given as a reason for a definitive NO answer - rather, the

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        that Phera was released earlier than The Crazy Companies II based on available
        information)". This indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to
        lack of specific release date information beyond the year. Since the model

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        that Phera was released earlier)". This is a case where the model is stating
        it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information about specific release
        dates within 1988. The parenthetical clarification indicates uncertainty rather
        than a definitive comparative judgment, so this should be classified as UNKNOWN
        rather than a definitive NO.

        to whether "Paappi Devataa" was released earlier than "Widows' Peak". The
        model determined that "Paappi Devataa" was released in 1995 while "Widows'
        Peak" was released in 1994, and concluded that "Paappi Devataa" was NOT released
        earlier.

        Fantasia 3" was released in February 2017, while it doesn't know the specific
        month for "Mehandi Laga Ke Rakhna." The NO answer is based on the assessment
        that "The Yuppie Fantasia 3" appears to have been released earlier, not because
        the release dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, though it acknowledges uncertainty due to incomplete information.
        Since it provides a clear "NO" as its comparative result, the answer is classified

        on the first movie being released earlier than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer. The model recognized
        that since "Mehandi Laga Ke Rakhna" was released in 2017 and "The Yuppie Fantasia
        3" was released in 2021, and 2017 comes before 2021, the correct answer is

        are the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in release dates,
        stating that "Maxed Out" premiered in March 2006 while "The Journals of Knud
        Rasmussen" premiered in September 2006, with "Maxed Out" being released earlier
        in the year. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Zacharias Kunuk's
        'The Journals of Knud Rasmussen' was not released earlier than James Scurlock's
        'Maxed Out.'" This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared

        stating that "Maxed Out" premiered in March 2006 while "The Journals of Knud
        Rasmussen" premiered in September 2006. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in timing, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (The Journals of Knud
        Rasmussen was not released earlier than Maxed Out)" as its final answer. This
        is a clear NO response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the films were released
        at different times - "The Journals of Knud Rasmussen" in September 2006 and
        "Maxed Out" in March 2006. The NO answer is based on the fact that "Maxed
        Out" was released before "The Journals of Knud Rasmussen," not because they
        were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        directly answering whether "The Journals of Knud Rasmussen" was released earlier
        than "Maxed Out." This is a clear negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        model did note the films were released in the same year, but it didn't give
        a definitive NO answer based on this equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        It explicitly states "I cannot give a clear YES or NO answer" because it only
        knows both films were released in the same year (1975) but lacks the specific
        month and day information needed to determine which was released first.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same as the reason for its NO answer. While it notes that both films
        were released in the same year (1975), it specifically states that "That Lucky
        Touch" was released earlier in the year than "Journey Into Fear" (which was
        released in October 1975). This difference in release timing within the same
        year is the reason for the NO answer, not that they were released at exactly
        the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Daniel Mann's "Journey Into Fear" was released
        earlier than Christopher Miles's "That Lucky Touch". The answer is clearly
        stated at the end of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that "Journey
        Into Fear" was released in February 1975, while "That Lucky Touch" was released
        later in 1975 (around July). The model concludes that "Journey Into Fear"
        was released earlier than "That Lucky Touch" within the same year. The NO
        answer appears to be inconsistent with the reasoning provided, as the model
        found a difference in release dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear and explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. It explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer"

        The model did note that both films were released in the same year (1975),
        but this wasn't used to provide a definitive NO answer - rather, the model
        indicated it couldn't make the determination without more specific date information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        that "Journey Into Fear" was released earlier than "That Lucky Touch" based
        on available information)". This is a case where the model is stating it cannot
        determine the answer due to lack of specific information (exact release dates
        within 1975). The parenthetical explanation clarifies that the "NO" means
        "I cannot confirm" rather than a definitive comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that "Tattooed Flower
        Vase" was released in July 1976 while "Norman... Is That You?" was released
        in September 1976, and concludes that "Tattooed Flower Vase" was released
        earlier. The model identified a difference in release dates (July vs. September)
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model has determined that "Norman... Is That You?" was not released before
        "Tattooed Flower Vase" based on its step-by-step analysis of release dates.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. In fact, it explicitly states that the release years are different
        (1984 for "Alphabet City" and 1983 for "Shanghai 13") and gives this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer. The model concludes that "Shanghai 13" was
        released earlier than "Alphabet City", not that they were released in the
        same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        explains that "Alphabet City" was released in 1984 while "Shanghai 13" was

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether "Alphabet City" was released earlier than "Shanghai

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both films were released in
        the same year (1984) and this equality in release years is the primary reason
        for the NO answer. The model explicitly notes "both films were released in
        the same year (1984)" and cannot determine which came first within that year,
        leading to the NO conclusion.

        stating "Alphabet City's theatrical release (April 1984) came after Shanghai
        13's release (March 1984)." The model's NO answer is based on this difference
        in release dates within the same year, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two movies. This is a direct and
        explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        does say "NO" at the end, it immediately qualifies this with "(I cannot confirm
        that Alphabet City was released earlier than Shanghai 13 based on the available
        information)". This indicates the model cannot determine the answer rather
        than providing a definitive NO to the comparative question. The model explicitly
        states it "cannot definitively state that one was released earlier than the
        other" and "cannot confirm that one was released earlier."

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer,
        indicating that it cannot confirm that "High Note" was released earlier than
        "Jaali Note". However, this is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot
        confirm" rather than making a definitive comparative judgment. The model explains
        it cannot determine which was released earlier because both films were released
        in the same year (1960) and it lacks more specific timing information. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model indicates it cannot make

        It explicitly states "I cannot give a clear YES or NO answer to whether 'High

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reason for answering NO is that both films
        were released in the same year (1960), and without more specific release date
        information within that year, it cannot confirm that "High Note" was released
        earlier. The model explicitly states "Both films were released in the same
        year - 1960" and bases its NO answer on this equality of release years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question of whether "High Note" was released earlier than
        "Jaali Note". The model provides this clear negative response after its step-by-step

        the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are
        the same is not applicable. According to the instructions, if the final answer
        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        It explicitly states "I cannot give a clear YES or NO answer" because it lacks
        specific release dates within the year 1960 to determine which film was released

        The model did note that both films were released in the same year (1960),
        but this wasn't presented as the reason for a NO answer - rather, it was presented
        as a reason why the model couldn't determine which came first without more

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not claim
        the values were equal - in fact, it found that one film was released on July
        29, 2008 and the other on August 1, 2008.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, the
        question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are the
        same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question" because it doesn't have enough precise
        data to determine which film was released earlier. This indicates the model
        is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. In fact, it suggests a difference, stating "it's more probable
        that 'Madly Bangalee' was released earlier in 2009" than "No One Knows About
        Persian Cats." The NO answer appears to be based on this assessment of different
        release timing, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it notes this answer has "low confidence due to incomplete specific
        release date information." Despite the low confidence, the model does provide
        a clear NO as its comparative result.

        'No One Knows About Persian Cats.'" This is a case where the model is saying
        "NO, I cannot confirm" which indicates it cannot make the comparison due to
        insufficient information, not that it has determined one film was definitely
        not released before the other. This falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        ("I cannot determine the exact month of "Madly Bangalee's" release within
        2009"). The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on insufficient information
        to make a determination, not because the release dates are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model provides some reasoning about uncertainty regarding exact

        it couldn't determine the answer due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO definitive answer can be provided
        with the information available to me." This indicates the model cannot determine
        which film was released earlier due to insufficient information. The model
        is not giving a definitive NO to the comparative question, but rather stating
        it cannot make the determination. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather expressed
        inability to determine which film was released earlier due to incomplete information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        that Madly Bangalee was released earlier)". This indicates the model cannot
        determine the answer due to insufficient information about specific release
        dates, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparative
        result. The parenthetical clarification shows the model is expressing inability

        the exact timing, noting that both films were released in 2009, but it lacks
        specific month information for "Madly Bangalee." The model suggests that "No
        One Knows About Persian Cats" might have been released first or around the
        same time, but doesn't definitively state they were released at the exact
        same time as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that it does not believe "Madly Bangalee" was released
        earlier than "No One Knows About Persian Cats." This is a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.

        dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "No One Knows About Persian
        Cats" premiered at Cannes in May 2009, while "Madly Bangalee" appears to have
        been released in the latter part of 2009. The model concludes that "No One
        Knows About Persian Cats" was likely released earlier in 2009 than "Madly
        Bangalee." The NO answer is based on this difference in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Madly Bangalee was
        not released earlier than No One Knows About Persian Cats)" as its final answer.

        "The Woman and the Stranger" was released very early in 1985 while "Family
        Life" appears to have been released later in 1985. The model is noting a difference
        in release timing within the same year, not equality.

        It explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive YES or NO answer" and "I

        stating that "The Black Dakotas" was released in September 1954, while "Romeo
        and Juliet" had its wider release in December 1954. The model concludes that
        "The Black Dakotas" was released earlier, which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        question doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal
        values - it actually concluded that the movies were released at different
        times (March vs May 1978).
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer. The model recognized

        a NO answer based on equal values; it actually concluded the items were different
        (one was released earlier than the other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. While it noted that both films were released
        in the same year (2001), it went further to find specific release dates and
        determined that "The Musketeer" was released on September 7, 2001, which is
        earlier than "Gypsy Woman" released on October 5, 2001. The NO answer was
        based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question, indicating
        that "Gypsy Woman" was not released before "The Musketeer" (in fact, it concluded

        answer. The uncertainty is presented as a caveat rather than a refusal to
        answer. The model is suggesting that "Love! Valour! Compassion!" was NOT released
        earlier than Upendra's film (assuming "Om" is the film in question).

        in 1995" and "Love! Valour! Compassion! was released in 1997" and concludes
        that "Omkaram was released approximately 2 years earlier." The NO answer is
        based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Love! Valour! Compassion!
        was not released earlier than Omkaram." This is a clear negative answer to
        the comparative question.

        years are different (1958 vs 1959) and concludes that "Nor the Moon by Night"
        was released earlier than "The Treasure of San Teresa." The NO answer indicates
        that the premise of the original question (likely asking if "The Treasure
        of San Teresa" was released earlier) is false.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question about which
        film was released earlier. The model determined that "Nor the Moon by Night"
        was released in 1958, which is earlier than "The Treasure of San Teresa" released
        in 1959.

        that "The Treasure of San Teresa" was released in 1959 while "Nor the Moon
        by Night" was released in 1958, meaning the first movie was released later
        (not earlier) than the second movie. The model explicitly states the values
        are different (1959 vs 1958) and this difference is the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "The Treasure of San Teresa" was released earlier than "Nor the
        Moon by Night". The model clearly indicates that "The Treasure of San Teresa"
        was released in 1959 while "Nor the Moon by Night" was released in 1958, and
        concludes that "The Treasure of San Teresa" was NOT released earlier than
        "Nor the Moon by Night" - it was released later.

        of San Teresa" (1959), which is the opposite of what was asked in the question.
        The model identified different years for the two movies.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether "The Treasure of San Teresa" was released earlier
        than "Nor the Moon by Night". The model reached this conclusion after determining
        that "Nor the Moon by Night" was released in 1958 while "The Treasure of San
        Teresa" was released in 1959.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question is automatically False. The model did note both films were
        released in the same year (1968), but its inability to determine which came
        first within that year led to the UNKNOWN classification, not a definitive
        NO based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        that Mingozzi's film was released earlier)". This indicates the model cannot
        determine the comparison due to lack of specific timing information within
        the same year. The parenthetical clarification shows this is a case where
        the model cannot verify the comparison, not a definitive comparative NO.

        Since the model explicitly states it cannot give a definitive answer and qualifies
        its "NO" as inconclusive, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        NO answer" and then says "If I had to make an educated guess based on probability,
        I would say NO..." but this is presented as a guess rather than a definitive

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. In fact, it suggests the opposite - that "Namma Ooru Poovatha"
        was likely released earlier in 1990 than "The Rookie" which was released in
        December 1990. The NO answer is based on this presumed difference in release
        timing, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model acknowledges uncertainty about the exact release date of "Namma
        Ooru Poovatha," it makes a comparative judgment based on the information it
        has, concluding with a clear "NO" answer to the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. In fact, it suggests a difference in timing, stating that
        "The Rookie" was released in December 1990 which is late in the year, and
        it's "more likely that 'Namma Ooru Poovatha' was released earlier in 1990."
        The NO answer is based on this presumed difference in timing within the same
        year, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer,
        specifically saying "NO (Clint Eastwood's 'The Rookie' was likely not released
        earlier than 'Namma Ooru Poovatha')". This is a clear negative comparative

        was released in 1995 while "Gulabi" was released in 1996, and that 1995 comes
        before 1996. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot give a definitive YES or NO answer with the information
        available" because it lacks the specific month and day for "Gulabi" to make
        a precise comparison, even though both films were released in 1995. This indicates
        the model cannot determine the answer with the available information.

        on insufficient evidence to confirm that "Gulabi" was released before "Here
        Come the Munsters," not because the release dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that without having the exact release date for "Gulabi"
        beyond the year 1995, it cannot confirm that "Gulabi" was released earlier
        than "Here Come the Munsters" (which was released on October 31, 1995).

        that since 1996 comes after 1995, "Gulabi" was NOT released earlier. The model
        is identifying a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        to whether Awam was released earlier than Dark Eyes" because it lacks the
        specific month and day information for both 1987 releases. This indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison with the information available.

        This is not a straightforward NO as a comparative result, but rather indicates
        the model cannot determine the answer due to lack of specific information
        about release months. The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively say
        that one was released earlier than the other" and "I cannot confirm that Awam

        The model did note that both films were released in the same year (1987),
        but this wasn't used to provide a definitive NO answer - rather it led to
        the model stating it couldn't determine which came first without more specific
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (because I cannot
        confirm that Awam was released earlier than Dark Eyes based on the available
        information)". This indicates the model is saying it cannot determine which
        film was released earlier, which makes this an UNKNOWN response. The model
        is stating it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison, not that
        the comparison is definitively false.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then recognized
        its mistake and explicitly corrected itself to "YES" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response after comparing the release dates of the two films and determining
        that "Les Mistons" (1957) was released earlier than "Tarawa Beachhead" (1958).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that "Click & Collect" was released LATER than "Autorsha" (December 24, 2018
        vs. August 10, 2018). The model explicitly states the dates are different
        and "Autorsha" came before "Click & Collect".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "Click & Collect" was released earlier than "Autorsha". The model
        explains that "Click & Collect" was released on December 24, 2018, while "Autorsha"
        was released on August 10, 2018, and concludes that "Click & Collect" was
        NOT released earlier than "Autorsha" - it was released later.

        and "'Click & Collect' was NOT released earlier than 'Autorsha' - it was released
        later."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "Click & Collect" was released earlier than "Autorsha". The model
        explicitly concludes with "Therefore, 'Click & Collect' was NOT released earlier
        than 'Autorsha' - it was released later. NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Autorsha" was released
        approximately four months before "Click & Collect," indicating a clear difference
        in release dates. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Ben Palmer's "Click & Collect" was released earlier than Sujith
        Vaassudev's "Autorsha." The model provides a definitive comparative judgment
        with a clear NO answer.
