      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films were released in
        1979, it does not give the NO answer because they were released at exactly
        the same time. Instead, it gives NO because it cannot confirm that one was
        released before the other without more specific date information. The same
        year release is mentioned but is not cited as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" in a boxed format at the end of its response. While it expresses uncertainty
        about exact dates, it does provide a clear NO as its final comparative answer.'

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both films were released
        in 1979 and uses this equality as the primary reason why it cannot determine
        which was earlier, leading to its NO answer. The model does not indicate any
        difference between the release dates, only that they are the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response. While it discusses uncertainty about exact dates
        within 1979, it does provide a clear final NO answer.'

      result: UNKNOWN
    2140f628-efca-4bc9-8a92-276b96d9aba4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Even if we had classified the final
        answer as NO, the model notes both films were released in the same year but
        explicitly states it lacks the specific dates needed to determine the actual
        order, rather than claiming equality as the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model expresses uncertainty and acknowledges
        limitations in making a definitive comparison, it ultimately provides a boxed
        "NO" as its final answer. However, since this NO is explicitly qualified with
        statements like "cannot make a definitive comparison" and "not possible to
        give a definitive YES or NO," this should be classified as UNKNOWN. The model
        is effectively stating it cannot determine the answer while technically providing
        a "NO."

      result: UNKNOWN
    3440abcc-4dfd-4506-9b54-fb01d07e7ed4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states both films were released in the same
        year (1979), but this is not given as the primary reason for the NO answer.
        Instead, the NO answer is given because the model "cannot confirm that Rope
        and Skin was released before" the other film due to lacking specific date
        information. The equality of years is noted but is not presented as the reason
        for the negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        NO" after reasoning about the release years. While it mentions uncertainty
        about exact dates, it still provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing

    41ba3e45-4a03-4817-bb47-d4db0e9cad09:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "both movies were
        released in 1979" and this equal release year is the basis for its NO answer.
        The model notes it cannot determine more specific timing within that year
        due to lacking exact dates, but the equality of the release years is the primary
        reason given for the NO response.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer would
        be: NO" as its final answer. While it discusses uncertainty about exact dates,
        it does provide a clear NO as its comparative conclusion.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both films were released in
        the same year (1979)" and this appears to be the primary reason for its NO
        answer. The model doesn't indicate any difference between the release dates,
        but rather emphasizes their contemporaneous nature and same year of release
        as the basis for its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with an explicit "NO" after its
        analysis. While it expresses uncertainty about exact release dates, it ultimately
        provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it
        cannot determine.

    7894ead9-0f6f-4743-aa99-192faf5a9de5:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both films were released
        in the same year (1979) and uses this equality as the primary basis for its
        NO answer. The model notes "both films were released in the same year" multiple
        times and doesn't identify any differences between their release timing, only
        noting uncertainty about more specific dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after considering the available information. While it expresses some
        uncertainty about exact dates, it ultimately provides a clear NO response
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        dates, only that they are in the same year, and explicitly uses this sameness
        as the basis for its conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found the values
        were different (January vs July release dates), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

    d5ba3aff-332e-4547-83a3-db6bf6516eda:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both films were released in
        1979 and uses this equality as the primary basis for its NO answer. While
        it mentions that exact dates within 1979 are unknown, it concludes they were
        "not released at significantly different times" and bases its NO answer on
        their same-year release, treating them as effectively equal in timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with a boxed "NO" as
        its final answer to whether one film was released earlier than the other.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both films were released in
        1981 (the same year), and this equality is the primary basis for its NO answer.
        While it mentions lacking more specific date information within 1981, it doesn't
        identify any differences between the release timing - rather, it uses their
        identical release years as the main justification for why one cannot be said
        to be earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The final answer
        is: NO" after reasoning about the release years. While it expresses some uncertainty
        about exact dates within 1981, it commits to a NO answer rather than refusing

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both films were released in
        the same year (1981) and uses this equality as the primary reason for its
        NO answer, indicating they were "released around the same time." The model
        doesn't indicate any difference in release timing, only that it lacks more
        specific date information within that year.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states both films were released in 1981
        and uses this similarity as the basis for its NO answer. The model explicitly
        notes "both films were released in the same year" and gives no indication
        of any difference in timing, using this equality as the primary reason for
        concluding NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer... would be: NO". While there is some hedging language earlier, the
        model does provide a clear final NO answer.'

    675624b6-ac00-489f-a9a8-c17e3a6e9b08:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films were released in
        1981, it does not give equality as the primary reason for its NO answer. Instead,
        it gives NO because it "cannot confirm Kalankini Kankabati was released before
        Asso without the exact dates." The model treats this as uncertainty about
        ordering within the same year rather than equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with a boxed "NO" as
        its final answer. While it expresses uncertainty about exact dates within
        1981, it ultimately commits to "NO" as its comparative answer rather than
        refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both films were released in
        1981 ("both films were released in the same year") and uses this equality
        as the primary basis for its NO answer. The model does not indicate any difference
        between the release dates, even a slight one, but rather uses their identical
        year of release as the reason it cannot say one came before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both movies were
        released in "the same year, 1981" and this equality is the primary reason
        for its NO answer. While it mentions that more specific date information might
        exist, the NO answer is fundamentally based on the equal release years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it notes some uncertainty about specific release dates
        within the year. Since it provides a clear NO as the comparative result, we
        classify this as NO.

    9ed824f2-279b-4bb1-bfe9-9a22376bb597:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both films were released
        in 1981, the NO answer is not given because the values are exactly equal.
        Rather, the NO is given because the model cannot confirm that one was released
        before the other without more specific date information. The model states
        "we cannot confirm 'Kalankini Kankabati' was released before 'Asso' without
        more specific information" as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both films were released in
        1981 and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO answer. While
        it mentions the lack of specific release dates, it bases its conclusion on
        the fact that they were released in the same year, making them essentially
        equal in timing.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both films were released
        in the same year (1981) and uses this equality as the basis for its NO answer.
        While it mentions not having more specific date information, the equal release
        years are presented as the primary reason for the negative comparison. This
        matches the criteria for a True classification where the values being compared
        are explicitly stated to be the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with a boxed "NO" answer,
        making this a clear NO response. While the model discusses some uncertainty
        about specific release dates, it ultimately provides a definitive NO answer
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        the NO answer is given because "it cannot be confirmed that Kalankini Kankabati
        was released earlier" due to lack of specific month/day information. The model
        does not state the releases were at exactly the same time - just that they
        occurred in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it expresses uncertainty about making the comparison. Since it does
        provide a clear "NO" answer rather than refusing to answer or stating it cannot
        determine, this should be classified as NO.

        in 1993, it does not explicitly state this equality as the reason for its
        NO answer. Instead, it emphasizes that without more specific release date
        information within 1993, it cannot determine which was released earlier. The
        same-year release is presented as context rather than the primary reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly provides a final boxed answer
        of "NO" after its analysis. While the model spends considerable time discussing
        the limitations of making a definitive comparison, it ultimately does provide
        a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states both films were released in 1952,
        but this is not given as the primary reason for the NO answer. Instead, the
        NO is because they "cannot confirm" one was before the other without more
        specific dates. The equality of years is mentioned but is not presented as
        the reason for the negative answer - rather, the lack of ability to confirm
        the ordering is the stated reason.

        films being released in "the same year" (1952). While it mentions uncertainty
        about specific dates within that year, the primary reason for the NO answer
        is that they were released in the same year, making them temporally equal
        at the year level.

        films being released in the same year (1952). The equality of release years
        is the primary reason given for the NO answer, with the model stating "they
        were released in the same year, making it not possible to say one was definitively
        earlier."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        the NO answer. While it mentions uncertainty about specific dates within that
        year, it uses the fact that they were released in "the same year" as the key
        reason for its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer.
        While it discusses uncertainty about specific dates within 1952, it ultimately

        1952, it does not give this equality as the reason for its NO answer. Instead,
        it gives the NO answer because without specific dates within 1952, it cannot
        verify if Mara Maru came first. The same-year observation is part of the analysis
        but not presented as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both movies were released in
        2003, it explicitly states it cannot determine which came first within that
        year. The NO answer appears to be based on the inability to verify the comparison
        rather than an explicit statement that the release dates are exactly the same.

        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had considered
        the final "NO" as the answer, the model notes both films were released in
        2003 but explicitly states it lacks information to determine their relative
        order - it does not claim they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the order due to missing exact
        release date information. Since the model states it "cannot be definitively
        confirmed without more precise information" and lacks data to make the comparison,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" at the end.

        it discusses the possibility of different dates within the year, the fundamental
        reason for the NO answer is that they share the same release year.

        but it does not base its NO answer primarily on them being released at exactly
        the same time. Instead, it arrives at NO because it cannot determine which
        came first within that year due to lack of specific date information. The
        equality of the year is noted but is not given as the primary reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer. While it discusses the complexity of determining exact release dates
        within 2003, it ultimately provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing

        answer. Instead, it expresses uncertainty about specific release dates within
        that year and arrives at NO through a "broader interpretation." The same year
        release is presented as context rather than the definitive reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        though it expresses uncertainty about exact dates within 2003. Since it provides

        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,

        explicitly states that Ned Kelly was released in March while Ente Veedu Appuvinteyum
        was released in October, and uses this difference to justify its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        to confirm if one was released earlier than the other. The same-year release
        is mentioned as context but not given as the primary reason for the negative
        answer.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that the films had different
        release years (1958 vs 1940) and concluded NO because one was later than the
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in the same year (1982),
        the model explicitly states different release dates (August 27 vs November
        19) and uses this difference, not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model concludes NO because "Wacko" was released earlier than "Still of
        the Night", not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether "Still of the Night" was released earlier than "Wacko",
        after determining specific release dates and making a direct comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Wacko
        was released in May 1982 while Still of the Night was released in November
        1982 - not because they were equal/same. It explicitly states that Wacko "was
        released before" Still of the Night.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on release dates it identified

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, while the model notes
        both films are from 1965, it does not claim they were released at the same
        time - in fact, it specifically mentions one was in February while the other's
        exact date is unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model gives a lengthy analysis and expresses
        uncertainty throughout, it ultimately provides "NO" as its final one-word
        answer. However, since this NO is explicitly given because the model "cannot
        conclusively say yes or no with absolute certainty," this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN. The model is essentially saying it cannot determine the answer,
        even though it ends with "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both films were released
        in 1965, it goes on to find specific release dates (February 23 vs February
        27) and determines they are different, with one being released before the
        other. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on them being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in a boxed format at the end of its response, after determining that Dr. Terror's

        only applies to NO answers.)

        a precise comparison cannot be made. The NO appears to be given despite the
        uncertainty rather than because the release dates are definitively equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as

        uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO answer is based on
        finding a difference in dates, not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both films were released
        in 1965, it does not give this equality as the reason for its NO answer. Instead,
        it arrives at NO because it cannot verify that "The Wild Chase" came first,
        given the lack of specific release dates within 1965. The equal year is mentioned
        as context but is not cited as the reason for the negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly provides a final answer of "NO"
        in a boxed format at the end of its response. While the model expresses uncertainty
        about exact release dates, it still commits to giving NO as its comparative
        answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        different dates (February 23 vs February 27, 1965), not because the values
        were equal. While they were released in the same year, the model explicitly
        noted a difference in specific release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        in 1952 (the same year), this is not explicitly stated as the reason for the
        NO answer. In fact, the model suggests that one could have been released before
        the other within that year, and the NO appears to be more due to inability
        to verify rather than equality of release dates. The model does not explicitly
        state that the release dates are exactly/approximately equal as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films were released in
        1965, it doesn't explicitly state this equality is the reason for the NO answer.
        The model discusses the lack of specific dates to determine order and suggests
        the impossibility of determining which came first, making this more of an
        inability to determine rather than an equality-based NO. The NO appears to
        be based on inability to verify order rather than explicit equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response. While it discusses the complexity of making

        in 1965, it does not explicitly state this equality as the reason for its
        NO answer. Instead, it emphasizes that it cannot determine which was released
        earlier without more specific date information within 1965. The NO appears
        to be based on inability to verify rather than equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response, though it expresses uncertainty about making

        only applies when the final answer is NO.

        the model did note both films were released in 2004, this equality was not
        used as the basis for a NO answer - rather, the model indicated uncertainty
        about the specific release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but qualifies it as being due
        to "inability to confirm" and "lack of specific information." This indicates
        the model cannot determine the answer rather than making a comparative conclusion.

        but rather to explain why it couldn't determine the order.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end,
        but the reasoning indicates this is because it cannot determine the order

        on this equality, indicating it cannot affirm one was released earlier than
        the other because they were released in the same year.

        inability to verify one came before the other (rather than their equality)
        is given as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer would be NO"
        and provides this as its final conclusion. While it discusses uncertainty
        about specific dates, it commits to NO as its comparative answer rather than

        the same time. Rather, it gives NO because it cannot confirm that "Or" was
        released earlier, given the lack of specific dates within 2004. The same-year
        release is presented as context for why more specific information would be
        needed, not as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:

        Instead, the NO answer is justified by the inability to confirm if one was
        released before the other due to lack of specific date information. The model
        explicitly acknowledges the possibility that "one could have been released
        slightly before the other" within that year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with a boxed "No" as
        its final answer. While it discusses uncertainty and complications, it ultimately

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (since we cannot conclusively
        determine one was released before the other based on the available information)".
        Since this is explicitly stating an inability to determine the comparison,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO. The model is not making
        a comparative conclusion, but rather stating it cannot make the determination.

        Instead, the NO appears to be based on the inability to determine the order
        within that year due to lacking specific release dates. The equality of years
        is noted but is not the primary reason for the negative answer.

        about the specific release dates, particularly for "Union Leader", and states
        it "cannot definitively conclude which film was released earlier." The NO
        answer appears to be based on this inability to verify the comparison rather

        equality wasn't used to definitively answer NO, but rather to explain why
        it couldn't determine the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response eventually states "NO" near the
        end, this NO is immediately qualified with an explanation that we "cannot
        confirm" which was released earlier without specific dates. The model is essentially
        saying it cannot determine the answer, making this equivalent to "NO, I cannot
        verify." This falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        the model notes both films were released in 2017, it doesn't use equality
        as a reason for its conclusion, but rather the inability to determine specific
        dates within that year.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does conclude with "NO" at the end,
        the reasoning provided clearly indicates it cannot determine the order due
        to lack of specific release dates within 2017. The model explicitly states
        "cannot be definitively determined" and notes insufficient detail. This makes
        it a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison, which should
        be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" at the end.

        to be the primary reason for the NO answer. While it mentions uncertainty

        the release dates were equal - it actually stated it couldn't determine one
        of the release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the reasoning leading
        up to it clearly indicates an inability to determine the answer due to missing
        release date information for Paappi Devataa. The model states "without the
        exact release year of Paappi Devataa, it's challenging to make a direct comparison"
        and shows an "inability to definitively confirm." This makes it a case where
        the model cannot determine the answer, despite ending with "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both movies were released
        in 1994, this is not presented as the reason for the NO answer. Instead, the
        model discusses the lack of specific release date information and the possibility
        that either could have been released first within that year. The NO appears
        to be based on insufficient evidence to confirm Paappi Devataa was released
        earlier, not because they were released at exactly the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be given as a comparative result, not a refusal or inability
        to determine. While the model expresses uncertainty about specific release

      explanation_final_answer: While the model concludes with "NO", the reasoning
        shows it cannot actually determine the order due to missing release date information

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine which was released first due
        to lack of specific release dates. Since the model states it "cannot conclusively

        Instead, it gives NO because it cannot confirm that Journey Into Fear was
        released earlier within that year. The reasoning is about inability to verify
        order within the same year, not about equality of release dates.

        which was released first due to lack of specific release dates within 1975,

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both movies were released in
        the same year (1984), but this is not given as the primary reason for the
        NO answer. Instead, the NO answer is based on the inability to confirm that
        Alphabet City was released earlier ("we cannot confirm Alphabet City was released
        before Shanghai 13 without more detailed information"). The equality of years
        is noted but isn't presented as the decisive factor for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both films were released in
        1984 and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO answer. While
        it mentions there could be different release dates within that year, it explicitly
        treats them as "simultaneous for the purpose of this question" and bases its
        NO answer on them sharing "the same year." This equality is the main justification
        for the NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates that both movies were released
        in 1984 (though with some uncertainty about Shanghai 13 possibly being 1985
        in some sources), and this apparent equality of release years is the primary
        reason given for the NO answer. The model states "both movies have a release
        year of 1984 in at least some sources" and concludes they were possibly "released
        in the same year."

        model does not indicate any difference between the release times, only that
        they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model states both films were released in 1984
        ("the same year") and this equality appears to be the primary basis for the
        NO answer. While it mentions not having exact dates, it doesn't indicate any
        known difference between release timing - rather, it uses their same-year
        release as the basis for concluding NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it notes uncertainty about exact dates. Since it provides
        a clear NO rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine,
        this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is primarily based on both films
        being released in the same year (1984). The model explicitly states "both
        films were released in 1984" and uses this equality as the main basis for
        its negative response. While it mentions some uncertainty about specific dates
        within that year, the fundamental reason for the NO answer is that they were
        released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis, making this a clear NO response. While the model discusses
        some uncertainty about exact dates within 1984, it ultimately provides a definitive
        NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        year (1984) and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO answer.
        While it mentions some uncertainty about exact dates and possible later releases
        in some countries, it bases its NO answer on both films having the same primary
        release year of 1984.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both films were released
        in 1960, it does not state they were released at exactly the same time. Instead,
        it gives NO because it lacks evidence to determine which came first within
        that year. The equality of the year is not given as the primary reason for
        the NO answer - rather, the inability to determine order within 1960 is the
        main reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        stating "NO because they were released in the same year, implying neither
        was definitively released earlier than the other based on year alone." The

        its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the reasoning shows
        it cannot make a definitive determination due to lacking specific release
        date information for "Madly Bangalee". The model explicitly states "a definitive
        answer can't be accurately provided" and indicates its answer is speculative.

        noted as a fact but not explicitly given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        though it expresses uncertainty about the precise timing within 1983. Since
        it provides a clear NO rather than refusing to answer or stating it cannot
        determine, this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both films were released
        in 1983, it does not use this equality as the reason for its NO answer. Instead,
        it gives NO because it "cannot confirm" the ordering due to lacking more precise
        release dates. The same-year observation is presented as context rather than
        the justification for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about the exact ordering within
        1983. Since it provides a clear NO answer (not just saying it cannot determine),
        this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        are equal. While it notes both movies were released in 1983, it finds specific
        release dates (August 26 vs December 24) and concludes NO because Daniel was
        released earlier, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this is a clear comparative result based on finding that Daniel

        answer. While it mentions not knowing exact dates within the year, the sameness
        of the release year is the key reason given for the negative comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both films were released
        in 1983, it does not give the NO answer because they were released at the
        same time. Instead, it gives NO because it lacks specific release dates to
        confirm which came first. The equality of the year is not given as the primary
        reason for the NO answer - rather, the inability to determine the specific
        order within that year is the stated reason.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is primarily based on the fact
        that both films were released in the same year (1983). The model explicitly
        states "both films were released in the same year" and uses this equality
        as the main reason why neither can be considered "earlier" than the other.
        While it mentions that more specific date information might exist, the NO
        answer is fundamentally based on their shared release year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly provides a final boxed answer
        of "No" after reasoning through the comparison. While it expresses some uncertainty
        about exact release dates within 1983, it ultimately commits to a clear NO
        answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model does note the films were released in the same year, this is irrelevant
        since we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but explains this is
        because it cannot confirm which was released first due to having only year-level
        data. This is effectively stating "NO, I cannot determine" which meets the
        criteria for UNKNOWN. The model is not making a comparative determination
        but rather indicating inability to make the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model does conclude with "NO" at the end,
        the reasoning shows significant uncertainty about one of the films ("Omkaram").
        The model makes assumptions and indicates it cannot confirm the exact release
        date of Omkaram, making comparisons impossible without precise data. This

        came first ("we cannot confirm 'Superfantagenio' was released earlier without
        more specific release date information"). The model's reasoning is about lack
        of evidence rather than equality.

        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        whether values are equal is not relevant since this only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning. While the
        model showed hesitation and acknowledged limitations in available information,
        it ultimately provided a clear YES answer.

    90aaeb98-2053-48eb-83bd-58836a00b14b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the release dates were equal - it stated it couldn't verify one of the films.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that one of the films may not exist
        or cannot be verified, and concludes with "NO" because it cannot confirm the
        earlier release. Since the model is rejecting the premise by questioning the
        existence of one film, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Even if we had classified the final "NO"
        as the answer, the model never indicated the values (release dates) were equal
        - instead it questioned the existence of one of the films.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", the bulk of the
        response indicates it cannot make a proper comparison because one of the films
        (Richard Stanley's "Brave") may not exist or there's confusion about its identity.
        The model explicitly states "a definitive comparison cannot be accurately
        made" and notes "the question's premise may be flawed." This rejection of
        the premise's validity makes this an UNKNOWN rather than a NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films were released in

        its answer - rather, it cited inability to verify exact release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        NO". However, in its reasoning, it states it "cannot conclusively determine
        which movie was released first" and gives the NO answer due to inability to

        1995) and stated that Here Come the Munsters was released before Gulabi. The
        NO answer was based on this difference in dates, not on equality.

    ad2e0630-04e5-4154-ad44-b1a0bfe29a6c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both films were released in
        the same year (1995), and this equality is a key part of its reasoning. However,
        the NO answer is primarily based on the inability to confirm which came first
        without more specific date information, not purely because they were released
        in the same year. The model specifically states "we cannot confirm Gulabi
        was released before Here Come the Munsters without more specific release date
        information" as its main reasoning for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it in bold. While it discusses uncertainty about exact dates, it
        still commits to NO as its comparative answer rather than refusing to answer
        or indicating it cannot determine.

        in the same year but explicitly states it lacks information to determine the
        actual order, not that equality is the reason for the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" multiple times, but the reasoning
        given is that it cannot determine the order due to lack of specific release
        dates within 1995. This makes it clear that the model cannot make a definitive

        releases being exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        The model explicitly states that "Dracula Untold" had an earlier global release
        (Oct 10 in US), making this difference in release dates the reason for the
        NO answer, not equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" to whether
        "The Knife That Killed Me" was released earlier than "Dracula Untold". This
        is a clear comparative answer based on global release dates.

        Instead, it acknowledges they could have been released at different times
        within that year and bases its NO answer on the inability to determine which
        came first. The model explicitly states "both films could have been released
        at different times within the same year."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after reasoning
        about the release dates. While it acknowledges uncertainty about specific

        released in the same year still allows for different release dates within
        that year.

        wasn't used as the primary reason for a NO answer - rather, the model indicated
        uncertainty about specific release dates within that year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine which film came first without
        more specific release dates. Since the model states it "cannot definitively
        determine which film was released earlier" and gives NO because it lacks information
        to verify the comparison, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both films were released
        in 1955, it does not cite this equality as the reason for its NO answer. Instead,
        it discusses the lack of specific release date information and suggests that
        one would need to look for "any sequence or precedence." The NO answer appears
        to be based on insufficient evidence to support the "earlier than" claim rather
        than on equality of release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it discusses the complexity of determining the exact order, it does
        provide this clear comparative answer rather than refusing or indicating inability
        to determine.
