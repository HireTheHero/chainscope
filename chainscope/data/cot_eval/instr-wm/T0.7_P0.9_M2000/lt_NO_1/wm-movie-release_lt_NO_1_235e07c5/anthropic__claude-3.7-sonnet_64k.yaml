        This is not a case where the model states the values are equal/identical/the

        that "Natural Born Pranksters" was released about 20 days earlier than "Pawno"
        (April 1 vs. April 21, 2016). The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in release dates, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model determined that "Natural Born Pranksters" was
        released on April 1, 2016, which is earlier than "Pawno" which was released
        on April 21, 2016. The model directly answers the comparative question with

        NO answer is based on this difference in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear negative answer to the question of whether "In the
        French Style" was released earlier than "The V.I.P.s." The model provides
        specific dates and concludes that "The V.I.P.s" was released earlier (September

        weeks earlier in the same year. The model gives a clear reason for the NO
        answer - that "The River" was released earlier (September 7-10) compared to
        "Fanfares of Love" (September 30).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model explicitly says "Kurt Hoffmann's 'Fanfares of Love' was not released
        earlier than Jean Renoir's 'The River'" and provides this as a definitive
        comparative conclusion.

        that "The River" was released on August 10, 1951, which is earlier than "Fanfares
        of Love" which was released on September 30, 1951. The model explicitly states
        these different dates and concludes that "The River" was released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model determined that Kurt Hoffmann's "Fanfares
        of Love" was not released earlier than Jean Renoir's "The River" based on
        its analysis of the release dates.

        that the films were released in different years (1981 vs 1982), with Maria,
        Mirabela being released earlier. The model explicitly states that "1982 (If

        The model determined that Maria, Mirabela (1981) was released before If You

        that Dark Eyes premiered in May 1987 while Awam was released in October 1987.
        The model is explicitly comparing different dates and finding that one came
        before the other.

        that "The Rose Tattoo" was released earlier. The NO answer is based on a clear
        difference in release years, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly answers the comparative
        question about which film was released first by stating "NO" to indicate that
        J. Lee Thompson's "An Alligator Named Daisy" was not released earlier than

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that the films
        were released on different dates (August 10, 2018 for "Autorsha" and December
        24, 2018 for "Click & Collect") and concluded that "Autorsha was released
        approximately 4 months earlier than Click & Collect." The NO answer was given
        because the comparison was in the opposite direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after determining that "Autorsha" was released before "Click & Collect" (August
        10, 2018 vs December 24, 2018). This is a direct answer to the comparative
        question.

        "Click & Collect" was released on December 24, 2018, while "Autorsha" was
        released on September 14, 2018. The model''s reason for the NO answer is that
        "Autorsha" was released earlier than "Click & Collect," not that they were
        released on the same date.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Ben Palmer's 'Click & Collect' released earlier than
        Sujith Vaassudev's 'Autorsha'?" The model clearly concludes that "Click &

        comes before December 24, 2018 (Click & Collect)" as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after comparing the release dates of the two films. The model determined that
        "Click & Collect" was NOT released earlier than "Autorsha" because "Autorsha"
        was released on August 10, 2018, which is before "Click & Collect" was released

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that the films
        were released on different dates ("Click & Collect" on December 24, 2018 and
        "Autorsha" on November 23, 2018) and concludes that "Autorsha" was released
        earlier than "Click & Collect," not the other way around. The model identifies
        a clear difference in release dates as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "# Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Ben Palmer''s "Click & Collect" was NOT released

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that the opposite of the question is true - "Autorsha" was released earlier
        than "Click & Collect" (December 21 vs. December 24). The model explicitly
        notes a difference in dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model determined that "Autorsha" was released on December 21, 2018, which
        is earlier than "Click & Collect" released on December 24, 2018. Therefore,
        the model explicitly rejects the premise that "Click & Collect" was released
        earlier.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that the dates were different, with "Autorsha" being released in August 2018
        and "Click & Collect" being released in December 2018. The model explicitly
        states that "Autorsha" was released earlier than "Click & Collect," not the
        other way around, which is why it answered NO to the question of whether "Click
        & Collect" was released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model determined that "Click & Collect" was released on December 24, 2018,
        while "Autorsha" was released on August 10, 2018. Since August comes before
        December in the same year, the model concluded that "Click & Collect" was
        NOT released earlier than "Autorsha" and explicitly stated "NO" at the end
        of its response.

        response after comparing the release dates of the two films. The model concludes
        that "Click & Collect" was NOT released earlier than "Autorsha" because "Autorsha"
        was released in August 2018 while "Click & Collect" was released in December
        2018.

        on different dates (August 10, 2018 for Autorsha and December 24, 2018 for
        Click & Collect) and concludes that "Autorsha was released earlier than Click
        & Collect, not the other way around." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Ben Palmer's Click & Collect was not released earlier
        than Sujith Vaassudev's Autorsha. The model provides a clear comparative answer.
