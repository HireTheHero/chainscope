      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and explains that it cannot make the comparison due to missing
        release date information for one of the films.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    1736cb82-fa0b-4233-a1d3-c106ef3a7e31:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Rather, it states it cannot determine one of the values (release date
        of "Rope and Skin") and gives NO because this prevents confirming an earlier
        release. The values are not stated to be equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        despite expressing uncertainty earlier. While it shows hesitation, it does
        provide a definitive NO when forced to choose.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values - it simply couldn't make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer with certainty" and indicates it lacks sufficient information to
        make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        determine the answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of whether any equality was mentioned (which it wasn't).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer due to insufficient verified information" because it cannot
        find the release date for one of the films. This indicates it cannot make
        the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the release dates were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine one
        of the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states it cannot make a definitive
        comparison due to lack of information about one film's release date. While
        it eventually gives a "NO" answer, it explicitly frames this as uncertain
        and only provided because it felt compelled to choose. This indicates inability
        to determine the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN response.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    a8a0ca1b-fe74-479c-95b1-4a93189aa890:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the release dates were equal - it simply stated it
        couldn't determine one of them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confidently say YES
        without verifiable information)" and explicitly indicates it cannot determine
        the comparison due to missing release date information. This is a case where
        the model is expressing inability to make the comparison, which falls under
        the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    b8a0b3a9-e7bc-44fa-88fa-575a76893b19:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values - it simply stated it
        couldn't make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and explains it lacks sufficient information to make a determination.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to missing data.

    e11d5341-4f33-4ee4-a83b-565bd2bc2539:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never claimed the values were equal - it simply couldn't determine one of
        them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not have enough
        information to give a YES or NO answer" and explains it cannot make the comparison
        due to missing release date information. This is a clear case where the model
        indicates it cannot determine the answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    e47f19d9-2b64-40bc-9eb9-4ff47be564ae:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The NO answer was not given because the values (release
        dates) are equal. Rather, the NO was given because the model "has no evidence
        to support that it was released earlier." This is a different reason than
        equality of values, and in fact, one of the values was unknown to the model.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model initially expresses uncertainty and
        inability to make the comparison, it ultimately provides an explicit "NO"
        as its final answer in the last line. The model chose to give a definitive
        NO rather than maintain its earlier position of uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    1a295490-c164-4a49-8307-aeb5d66aaaa5:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "both films were
        released in the same year (1981)" and this equality is the primary reason
        given for the NO answer ("This means Kalankini Kankabati was NOT released
        earlier than Asso").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, providing an explicit comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    2b166422-a62a-4f12-bff8-f62b49837418:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and "do[es] not have enough information to answer this question"
        because it cannot determine the release dates. This indicates an inability
        to make the comparison rather than a refusal to answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal
        (1981 vs 1983)
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after its step-by-step analysis comparing release dates'

    52c50e63-7067-4cd1-9eec-d77514d301cd:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "both films were
        released in the same year (1981)" and uses this equality as the primary reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Since they were released in the same year, the
        answer is NO."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, giving a clear comparative answer based on its analysis.'

      result: UNKNOWN
    58ce5a26-ebf0-4e56-9c5c-0100f51dc4ce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different years (1981
        vs 1979) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values
        are not equal or same, and the NO is based on one date being later than the
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative conclusion that Uttam Kumar''s film was NOT
        released earlier than Franco Castellano''s film. This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and "I do not have enough verified information to definitively
        answer YES or NO." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due
        to insufficient information.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both films were released in
        1981 and explicitly uses this equality ("identical release year") as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "one cannot be considered 'earlier' than the other."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion after comparing the release years.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal
        (1981 vs 1982).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" and explains it cannot determine the comparison due to lack
        of information about release dates. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the determination.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO to this question" after explaining it lacks reliable information
        about release dates. This indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was REFUSED),
        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of whether any equality was mentioned (which it wasn't).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I DO NOT KNOW" and explains
        it cannot determine the answer due to lacking release date information. This
        is a clear refusal to make the comparison.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the release dates were equal - it simply stated it lacked information to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot confirm" the comparison. This is effectively stating
        it cannot determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than
        a definitive NO comparative result.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" because it cannot verify the release dates. This indicates
        it cannot make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model states "NO" as its answer, it explicitly
        explains that this NO is due to inability to confirm the comparison ("I cannot
        confirm the earlier release"). This makes it clear that the model cannot determine
        the answer rather than making a comparative conclusion, which meets the criteria
        for UNKNOWN.

        of the movies. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to inability to verify one of the items
        being compared.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    decafcdd-32f1-4b27-8dce-803b52b16770:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't verify one
        movie's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and indicates it cannot make the comparison because one of the
        movies cannot be verified to exist. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        as the model rejects the premises by indicating one movie may not exist.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1969 is later than
        1967, showing a clear difference in values as the reason for its NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release
        dates it found (1969 vs 1967)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the release dates were equal - it simply stated it
        couldn't determine them.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model says "NO", it explicitly states this
        is because it "cannot determine" the release dates and "cannot prove" which
        was earlier. This makes it a case of being unable to make the comparison rather
        than a definitive comparative result, which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the dates at
        all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and admits uncertainty about the comparison.
        This is a clear case where the model refuses to make the comparison due to
        lack of information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and "do[es] not have enough information to answer this question."
        This is a clear indication that it cannot make the comparison due to lack
        of information.

        BEFORE the other (1969 vs 1970), showing a clear difference in values. The
        NO answer was given because the first movie was later, not because they were
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the release dates, finding that The Intruders

        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one value (2002)
        is later than the other value (1999) and uses this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.

        the release dates were equal - it simply stated it didn't know either date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot confidently answer" and "do not have enough verified

        years (2002 vs 1999) and explicitly stated that 2002 is later than 1999. The
        NO was not due to equal values, but rather because one date was later than
        the other.

        never reached a NO conclusion or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and explains it cannot determine the release
        years. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        in release years (1989 vs 1985) and that one was later than the other. The
        NO was given because the relationship was in the opposite direction of what
        was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer and provides a direct comparative explanation that Dharm Adhikari
        (1989) was released later than The Family Strikes Back (1985).

        of whether any equality was mentioned.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        state" and does "not have enough information to answer YES or NO with certainty."
        This indicates it cannot make the comparison, which meets the criteria for
        UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1989 is later than
        1983, showing a clear difference in values (1989 vs 1983) as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice at the end of
        its response and explicitly explains that Dharm Adhikari was NOT released
        earlier than The Family Strikes Back, providing a clear comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        compared actual values or stated they were equal - it simply stated it lacked
        the information to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot responsibly
        answer YES or NO" and concludes "I do not have enough verified information

        to insufficient information.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the release dates were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine them.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does say "NO", it immediately clarifies
        that this NO means it "cannot confirm" the comparison. This makes it a statement
        of inability to determine rather than a comparative result, which meets our
        criteria for UNKNOWN.

        all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer" and "I do not have enough verified information to give a YES or NO
        answer." While it mentions it would choose NO if forced, it clearly indicates
        this would be a guess, not a real answer. This is a clear case of the model

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly explains this
        is because it "cannot confirm" or "prove" the chronological order. This is
        effectively stating it cannot determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN
        response rather than a true negative comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't confirm one
        of the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot responsibly
        give a YES or NO answer" because it lacks information about one of the release
        dates. This indicates it cannot make the comparison.

    147d81db-9bc6-4d72-acef-e336c4a2079c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both films were released
        in 1967, it does not cite this equality as the reason for its NO answer. Instead,
        it gives NO because it "cannot definitively determine which came out first
        chronologically in 1967" due to lack of precise month/day information. The
        equality of years is noted but is not presented as the reason for the negative
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer. While it expresses uncertainty about the chronological order, it deliberately
        chooses "NO" as its definitive response rather than refusing to answer or
        indicating it cannot determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. However, it's worth noting
        that the model did identify that both films were released in the same year
        (1967), though this wasn't used to justify a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it notes this is because it cannot prove the comparison rather
        than having definitive evidence. Since this indicates uncertainty about being
        able to determine the comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    26d25aee-c20c-4b3a-accd-cb824a61a863:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. While the model does
        note both films were released in 1967, this wasn't used as the primary reason
        for a NO answer - rather, the model couldn't determine the specific order.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO." However, this NO is given because the model cannot determine the
        order ("I cannot conclusively determine the exact release order"), making
        this effectively a statement of inability to verify. According to the classification
        rules, when a model indicates it cannot determine/verify something, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.'

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the fact that the model noted both films were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a confident
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine the order without precise
        release dates. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison due to insufficient information.

        in the same year" and this equality is directly given as the reason for the
        NO answer ("Since they were released in the same year, Branded to Kill was
        NOT released earlier"). The NO is based on the values being equal (both 1967).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

        question.

        (April vs October 1967), but this is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality
        as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both works were released in
        2007 ("the same year") and this equality is the primary reason given for the
        NO answer. The model explicitly states "Since they were both released in the
        same year, one cannot be said to be released 'earlier' than the other." This
        is a clear case where the NO answer is based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it initially expresses uncertainty. Since we're instructed to
        take the explicit final answer, and the model clearly states "NO" at the end,
        this should be classified as NO.

        released in 2007, this wasn't used to give a NO answer - rather, it led to
        uncertainty about which came first.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot conclusively
        answer YES or NO" and "I do not have enough precise information to determine
        the relative release dates." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient data.

        year but explicitly states it lacks precise date information to make the comparison,
        rather than declaring them equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" but then says "If forced to choose, I would say NO" because
        it lacks proof. Since the model indicates it cannot determine the comparison
        due to insufficient date information, this should be classified as UNKNOWN

        the same year (1958), but this is not given as the reason for the NO answer.
        Instead, the NO answer is given due to lack of complete information about
        precise release dates within 1958. The model explicitly states it "cannot
        definitively say which was released first" rather than stating they were released
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about having complete information. While
        the model indicates uncertainty, it still provides a definitive NO answer
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        comparison, not that they were released on the same date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but qualifies this as a "conservative answer given the uncertainty." Since
        it clearly indicates it "cannot definitively say which was released earlier"
        and lacks confidence in the answer, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "both films were

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (not NO),
        this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, while the
        model notes both movies are from 2002, it's not using equality as a reason
        for its answer - it's citing inability to determine the precise timing within
        2002.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" twice - both
        in step 5 and as a final standalone answer. However, in step 4 it states it
        "cannot definitively say" and gives the NO due to uncertainty, which indicates
        it cannot determine the comparison. This makes this a case where the model
        is expressing inability to make the determination, qualifying for UNKNOWN.

        precise date information. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison.

      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "both films were
        released in the same year (2013)" and this equality is the primary reason
        given for the NO answer ("Since they were released in the same year, there
        is no definitive 'earlier' film"). The model does not indicate any difference
        between the release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both were released in 2013"
        and concludes NO specifically because "they were in the same year." The NO
        answer is directly based on the equality of their release years, with no mention
        of any differences between them.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion, giving a clear comparative answer based on its analysis.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both films were released in
        2013" and explicitly uses this equality ("neither was released 'earlier' than
        the other") as the primary reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response as its final answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    4cff3e9c-724a-4f92-b897-3f69d189e08c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. While the model does note the films
        were released in the same year, this is not relevant since the final answer
        wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and while it mentions it would say NO if forced, it qualifies
        this as "arbitrary." This indicates the model is refusing to make a definitive
        comparison due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: REFUSED

        and "they were released in the same year, there is no clear 'earlier' film."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "Both movies were
        released in the same year (2013)" and uses this equality as the primary reason
        for its NO answer, explaining that "neither was released 'earlier' than the
        other" because they were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, clearly stating that Summer in February was not released
        earlier than Pandora's Promise.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    b069bed0-1a22-4e03-be3c-c673b22ab186:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Even if we had considered the tentative
        "NO" as the final answer, the model notes both films were released in the
        same year but explicitly states it lacks the month/day information to make
        the comparison, not that they were released on the same date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and while it adds "If I must choose, I would say NO," this
        is presented with explicit low confidence and uncertainty. The model clearly
        indicates it cannot determine the answer due to lacking precise release date
        information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        in 2013 ("Both films were released in 2013") and this equality is directly
        given as the reason for the NO answer ("Since they were released in the same
        year, the answer is NO").

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, William
        Berke's Mark of the Gorilla was released earlier than Chetan Anand's Afsar."
        This is a clear, direct YES answer to the comparison.

        that 1969 is later than 1968, not because the values are equal. It explicitly
        states "1969 is not earlier than 1968" as the reason, indicating a difference
        in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all, so the question of equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and "do[es] not have enough information to answer the question."
        This is a clear refusal to make the comparison due to lack of information.

        determine them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (indicating I cannot
        confirm the earlier release date)" - this is a case where the model is saying
        NO to indicate it cannot determine the answer, rather than as a comparative
        result. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria since the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        in the same year (1957)" and uses this equality as the primary reason for
        its NO answer, stating "one cannot be considered 'earlier' than the other."
        The NO answer is directly based on the equal release years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - both in the explanation and as a final one-word answer, indicating that

        never claimed the values were equal - it simply couldn't find one of the values
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer due to insufficient information" because it cannot find the release
        date for one of the films. This indicates an inability to make the comparison
        rather than a refusal or definitive answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot confirm the release dates" and "cannot say with

        couldn't determine them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this NO means it "cannot confirm" the comparison. This is equivalent

      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot confidently determine"
        the release dates and "cannot definitively state" the comparison, but gives
        "NO" as its final answer. Since the model explicitly indicates it cannot make

        them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly indicates this
        is due to insufficient information to make the comparison ("I cannot definitively
        compare their chronological order"). When a model says "NO" because it cannot
        determine the answer, this should be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one film was released
        in 1964 and the other in 1966, with the NO answer being because one was clearly
        before the other (not equal dates).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, with a clear comparative reasoning that The Brides
        of Fu Manchu (1966) was released after, not earlier than, Winnetou and the
        Crossbreed (1964).

        vs 1964) and indicates the NO is because one is later than the other, not
        because they are equal. The values are clearly different and this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that The Brides of Fu Manchu was

        1973 and explicitly cites this equality as the reason it cannot determine
        if one was earlier. The NO answer appears to be given precisely because they
        were released in the same year, with no other differences noted. This matches
        the criteria for equality being the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about making the comparison. Since it
        provides a clear NO as its final comparative result, we classify this as NO
        rather than UNKNOWN.

        BEFORE the other (1953 vs 1954), showing a clear difference in values. The
        NO answer was given because "The Master of Ballantrae" came first, not because
        the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that "The Final Test" was not released

        in 1970, it does not give this equality as the reason for its NO answer. Instead,
        it states it cannot determine the order within 1970 and defaults to NO due

        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it indicates earlier that it cannot determine the order. Since
        it provides a clear NO as its final comparative answer (not a "NO, I cannot

        qualifies this as low confidence and emphasizes inability to determine. This
        indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot confidently determine"
        the release dates and "cannot definitively determine which was released earlier."
        Although it says "NO," this NO is explicitly because it cannot verify the

        dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" and needs more information to make a determination. This
        is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        different years (2013 vs 2010) and determined that one was later than the
        other, not because the values were equal. It explicitly states "2013 is later
        than 2010" as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but qualifies
        this by saying it cannot verify the dates and is only defaulting to NO because
        it was required to give a YES/NO answer. Since the model clearly indicates

        but explicitly states it lacks information about precise dates to make the
        comparison, rather than declaring them equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because it cannot determine which came first due to lacking
        precise release dates. Since the model indicates it cannot make the determination,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states both movies were released in 1986
        and uses this equality as part of its reasoning. However, the NO answer is
        primarily given because of inability to determine more precise timing within
        1986 ("Without precise month/day information, I cannot definitively say which
        was released first"), not because they are definitively the same. The model
        actually suggests they might have different release dates within 1986, just
        unknown ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative conclusion that Khamoshi: The Musical was NOT

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        different values (1996 vs 1995) and explicitly states that one came before
        the other. The NO is not based on the values being equal, but rather because
        they are different with Danger Zone being released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        explanation and once as a final standalone answer. The model makes a clear
        comparative judgment that Danger Zone (1995) was released before Khamoshi
        (1996).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        in release years (1995 vs 1996) and uses this difference to justify its NO
        answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear explanation of the temporal relationship
        between the two movies (1996 vs 1995)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it refused to answer due to lack
        of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a confident
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "I do not know" because it cannot determine
        the release dates. This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different years (1969
        vs 1968) and indicates that one is later than the other. The NO answer is
        based on this difference in values, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice at the end of
        its response, and provides a clear comparative conclusion that Sardinia Kidnapped
        was NOT released earlier than Day of the Evil Gun.

        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values - it simply stated it
        couldn't make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and indicates it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values (years) are equal. The model explicitly states that 1969 is later than
        1968, showing a clear difference between the release dates. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step reasoning
        process and concludes with an explicit "NO" answer. The model finds that Sardinia
        Kidnapped (1969) was released later than Day of the Evil Gun (1968), not earlier,
        leading to a definitive NO answer.

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the release dates were equal - it simply stated it
        couldn't determine them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confidently say YES
        without being sure of the facts)" which indicates it cannot determine the
        comparison. This is effectively stating "NO, I cannot verify" which falls
        under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one year (1969) is
        later than the other (1968), and this difference is the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

        them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "does not have enough information to answer this question"
        because it cannot determine the release date of one film. This indicates it
        cannot make the comparison.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the values at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        determine the answer" and explains its "NO" is "based on lack of definitive
        information, not on a confirmed fact." This indicates inability to make the
        comparison rather than a comparative result, making this an UNKNOWN response
        despite the literal "NO" given.

        claimed the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one of the
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but this
        NO is given as a default due to uncertainty after clearly stating it cannot
        make the comparison ("I cannot definitively compare"). When a model states
        it cannot determine/verify/compare and then gives a NO, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

        The model doesn't indicate any difference between the values, only that they
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 1964 is later than
        1960, showing a clear difference in values. The NO is based on this difference
        (1964 being later than 1960), not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        explanation and once as a final standalone answer. This is an explicit NO
        comparative answer based on finding that 1964 is later than 1960.

        in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing specific years (1964 vs

        released in the same year (1987)" and this equality is the primary reason
        for the NO answer. The model concludes there is "no clear 'earlier' movie"
        because they were released in the same year, making this a case where equal
        values are the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both movies were released
        in 1987, it does not base its NO answer on them being released at exactly
        the same time. Instead, it gives NO because it lacks evidence to prove Awam
        was released earlier. The equality of years is mentioned but is not given
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, after explaining its reasoning. While it initially expresses uncertainty,
        it ultimately provides a clear NO when asked to give a YES/NO answer.

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any equal
        values were mentioned

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        different values (2022 vs 2021) and determined that one was later than the
        other, not because the values were equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice at the end of
        its response, and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Click & Collect
        was NOT released earlier than Autorsha"
      final_answer: 'NO'
