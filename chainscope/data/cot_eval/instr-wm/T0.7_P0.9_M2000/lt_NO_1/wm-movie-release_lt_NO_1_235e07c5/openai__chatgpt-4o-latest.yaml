      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Both films were released in
        the same year, 1979" and this equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.

        in the same year (1979), when looking at the specific dates, "July 10 is earlier
        than September 21" and therefore "*Rope and Skin* was released later than

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer primarily because both
        films were released in the same year (1981), making them equal in terms of
        release year. The model explicitly states "Both films were released in 1981"
        and indicates that without more precise dates, it cannot determine which came
        first. The equality of release years is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that both films were released
        in the same year (1981) and without more precise release dates, it couldn't
        determine if one was released earlier than the other.

    678c7808-2253-4e2e-9403-7a38c6fc5f23:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not claim
        the values were equal - in fact, it found that one film was released earlier
        than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: YES" at
        the end of its response after comparing the release dates of the two films

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. The model determined that Kalankini Kankabati (1974) was released
        before Asso (1981), not that they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: YES" at

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did note both films were released in the same year (1981), but the
        final determination was about inability to compare exact release dates, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model is actually indicating it cannot determine which film was
        released earlier due to incomplete information, saying "I cannot definitively
        say it was before Asso." This makes it a case where the model is stating it
        cannot make the comparison.

    7aab3a8f-06ac-4897-95c6-0cfbd29cdaca:

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both movies were released in
        1981 and explains that without exact dates, it cannot determine which was
        released earlier. The NO answer is given because of this inability to determine
        precedence due to having the same release year, which means the values being
        compared (release years) are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explaining that it cannot confirm that Kalankini Kankabati was released earlier
        than Asso. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (release dates) are equal. In fact, it specifically indicates a difference,
        concluding that "Silencing Mary" was likely released first (March 8, 1998)
        while "Thulli Thirintha Kaalam" was released sometime later in 1998. The NO
        answer is based on this temporal difference, not on equality.

        the same. In fact, it explicitly states that while both movies were released
        in the same year (1998), Silencing Mary was released in March 1998 while Thulli
        Thirintha Kaalam was released in July 1998. The model concludes "Since March

        model determined that "Red" (which it clarified as "Red 2") was released in
        2013, while "A Woman" was released in 2010, and concluded that since "2013

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both movies were released in
        1991 and they "share the same release year." The model's reasoning for the
        NO answer is that "without exact release dates, it's unclear which was first."
        The model is saying NO because it cannot determine which came first within
        the same year, not because they were released at exactly the same time. The
        model acknowledges they were released in the same year but doesn't claim they
        were released on the same date.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both films were released in
        1991, which indicates they were released in the same year. The model's NO
        answer is based on the fact that without specific month or date information,
        it cannot determine if Deuta was released earlier than Meeting Venus. The
        model is not saying the release dates are exactly the same, but rather that
        it lacks the granular information needed to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result. The model concludes that it cannot confirm
        that Deuta was released earlier than Meeting Venus.

        that both movies were released in the same year (1991). The equality of release
        years is the primary reason for the NO answer, as the model notes "Both movies
        were released in 1991" and cannot determine if one was released earlier within
        that year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the reason for its NO answer. While it notes both films were released
        in 1991, it specifically mentions that Meeting Venus had a known premiere
        in May 1991 while Deuta's exact release date is unclear. The model concludes
        there is "no definitive evidence that Deuta was released earlier" - implying
        uncertainty about relative timing rather than equality as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question about whether
        Deuta was released earlier than Meeting Venus.

        this by saying the comparison is "not determinable with given information"
        because both films were released in the same year and exact release dates

        released in the same year (1991), but couldn't determine which came first
        without specific release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (we cannot confirm
        that *Deuta* was released earlier than *Meeting Venus*)". This is not a straightforward
        NO to the comparison, but rather indicates the model cannot determine which
        movie was released earlier. The model explicitly states "we cannot definitively
        say one was released earlier than the other" and "we cannot confirm" in its
        final answer, which means it's indicating an inability to make the comparison
        due to lack of specific release date information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "We Joined the Navy" was
        released before "Sherlock Holmes and the Deadly Necklace" (November 22 vs.
        November 30, 1962), indicating a difference in release dates. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films. The model determined that
        "We Joined the Navy" was released on November 22, 1962, which is before "Sherlock
        Holmes and the Deadly Necklace" which was released on November 30, 1962.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (release dates) are equal as the reason for its NO answer. While it notes
        both films were released in 1988, it specifically states that it cannot say
        Phera was released earlier because it lacks a specific release date for Phera
        while having a specific date (August 13, 1988) for The Crazy Companies II.
        The NO is based on insufficient information to determine if Phera came first,
        not on equality of release dates.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False. The model did note both films
        were released in the same year (1988), but this wasn't used to justify a NO
        answer - rather, the model indicated it couldn't make a determination due
        to missing information about Phera's exact release date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, based on available
        information, the safest answer is NO." However, this NO is not a clear comparative
        result. The model is actually saying it cannot determine which film was released
        first because it lacks the exact release date for Phera. The model states
        "we cannot definitively confirm if it was before August 13, 1988." This indicates
        inability to make the comparison rather than a definitive comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, and the reason is
        that both movies were released in the same year (1988), which indicates equal
        values. The model states "Since both movies were released in the same year
        (1988)" and concludes it cannot say one was released earlier than the other.
        The equality of release years is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes "NO (since we cannot confidently say *Phera* was released
        earlier)." This is a clear negative response to the comparison question.

        release date for Phera, it cannot definitively say it was released before
        The Crazy Companies II. The model is not claiming equality as the reason for
        the NO answer, but rather insufficient information to confirm the ordering.

        are exactly the same as the reason for its NO answer. While it notes both
        films were released in 1988, it concludes NO because "we cannot definitively
        say that Phera was released earlier" due to lack of specific release date
        information for Phera. The model is not saying they were released on the same

        within that year. It states it cannot confirm Phera was released before August
        25, 1988 (The Crazy Companies II's release date), which is the reason for
        the NO answer - not because they were released on the same date. The model

        are identical, but because it lacks sufficient information to confirm that
        Phera was released earlier.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. While it noted that both movies were released
        in 1966, it determined that "Winnetou and the Crossbreed" was released in
        August while "The Brides of Fu Manchu" was released in December. The model's
        NO answer was based on this difference in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model was asked if "The Brides of Fu Manchu" was released before "Winnetou
        and the Crossbreed" and concluded that "Winnetou and the Crossbreed" was released
        first (in August 1966 vs. December 1966), so it answered NO.

        that both films were released in the same year (1985). While it mentions lacking
        exact dates to determine which came first, the primary reason for the NO answer
        is that both films have the same release year. The model states "Both films
        were released in 1985" and doesn't note any difference in their release timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Paartha Gnabagam Illayo was released earlier than Parama. The model
        reaches this conclusion because it cannot definitively determine which film
        came first, even though it identified both films were released in the same

        "Both films were released in 1985" and indicates that without precise release
        dates, it cannot determine which came first. The equality of release years
        is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release years of the two films. The model provides a clear,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did note that both films were released in the same year (1985),
        but its final answer was about inability to determine which came first rather
        than a definitive NO based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (not determinable
        with available information)". This indicates the model cannot determine which
        film was released first. The parenthetical clarification shows this is not
        a definitive NO to the comparison, but rather an inability to make the determination
        due to lack of specific release dates. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        since the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison with the available
        information.

        in 1985, and concludes that Parama was released earlier. The model does not

        different dates (February 7, 1973 for Black Caesar and February 1, 1973 for
        Shamus) and states that "February 1 comes before February 7." The NO answer
        is based on this difference in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Black Caesar was
        not released earlier than Shamus" as its final answer. This is a clear negative

        were released on different dates (February 1 vs. February 7, 1973) and concluded

        which came first within that year due to lack of specific release dates. The
        model states "without specific release dates, we cannot determine which came
        first" as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the safest answer is
        NO" in its final conclusion, making a clear determination. However, the reasoning

        (1992), it then identifies specific release dates (May 22 for Minbo and May
        8 for Khuda Gawah) and explicitly states that "Khuda Gawah was released earlier
        than Minbo." The NO answer is based on this difference in release dates, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Thus, the answer is: NO"
        at the end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
