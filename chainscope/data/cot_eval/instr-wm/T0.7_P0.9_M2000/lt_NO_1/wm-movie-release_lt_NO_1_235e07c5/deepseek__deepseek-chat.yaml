        final answer after comparing the release dates, determining that The Glass
        Castle was released earlier than The West Point Story.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in the same year (1950),
        the model explicitly notes a difference in their specific release dates (October
        18 vs December 22) and uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The
        NO answer is not based on the values being equal, but rather on finding a
        clear difference in release dates.

        The Glass Castle (September 27) was released earlier than The West Point Story
        (December 22), not because the dates were equal. It explicitly states a difference
        in release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that "The West Point Story was not released earlier
        than The Glass Castle."

        the reason for the NO answer (along with inability to determine more specific
        timing). The values being compared (release years) are stated to be exactly
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        in the same year (1958), and this equality is the primary reason for the NO
        answer. While the model mentions it cannot determine specific dates within
        that year, the NO answer is directly based on the films having the same release
        year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result based on the release years being
        the same (1958). While the model notes it cannot determine specific dates
        within 1958, it still provides a definitive NO answer rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the release dates were equal. The model explicitly states different release
        dates (March 19, 1982 vs November 19, 1982) and indicates that Wacko came
        out earlier. The NO answer was given because Still of the Night came later,
        not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        reach its conclusion.

        was released on March 12, 1982, while Still of the Night was released on November
        19, 1982, and concludes that Wacko was released earlier. The NO answer was
        due to this difference in dates, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Still of the Night was not released
        earlier than Wacko.

        answer.

        to Recognizing Your Saints (January 23, 2006). The NO answer was given because
        one film was released earlier than the other, not because they were released
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films were released in
        1962 (the same year), it does not use this equality as the primary reason
        for its NO answer. Instead, it states NO because there is "no evidence to
        confirm it was earlier." The lack of evidence to determine order, not the
        equality of years, is given as the main reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it notes this is due to lack of evidence to confirm one was earlier.
        Since this NO is given as a direct comparative result (not a rejection of
        ability to compare or premises), it should be classified as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    431ae29f-f40e-4a59-9a91-ea9c886dec98:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in release dates
        (September 6 vs October 11, 1962) and indicates "We Joined the Navy came out
        earlier."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        the same time. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (October
        11 vs September 6, 1962) and indicates that "We Joined the Navy was released
        earlier than Sherlock Holmes and the Deadly Necklace." The NO answer is based
        on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that "Sherlock Holmes and the Deadly Necklace was not
        released earlier than We Joined the Navy."

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1962, the model
        explicitly states different months (July vs October) and bases its NO answer
        on this difference, not on equality. The model concludes NO because one film
        came later, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" after
        determining that Sherlock Holmes and the Deadly Necklace was not released

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the release dates were equal. The model explicitly states different release
        dates (October 11, 1962 vs September 18, 1962) and indicates that "We Joined
        the Navy" was released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        the same time. In fact, it explicitly states different release dates (October
        11 vs October 4) and concludes that "We Joined the Navy came out earlier."
        The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Sherlock Holmes and the Deadly Necklace was not released earlier
        than We Joined the Navy. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that La Zizanie was released
        in February 1978 while Germany in Autumn was released in March 1978, and concludes
        that La Zizanie was released earlier. The NO answer was based on this difference
        in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films, where it determined La
        Zizanie was released earlier than Germany in Autumn.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. The model explicitly states that La
        Zizanie was released in February 1978 while Germany in Autumn was released
        in March 1978, and concludes that La Zizanie was released earlier. The NO
        answer was due to this difference in dates, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Germany in Autumn was not released
        earlier than La Zizanie. The answer is definitive and based on specific release
        dates provided.

        in February 1978 and Germany in Autumn in March 1978, with La Zizanie being
        released earlier. The NO is based on this difference in dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically answering whether Germany in Autumn was released earlier than
        La Zizanie. The answer is direct and comparative.

        while Germany in Autumn was released in March 1978, and concludes that La
        Zizanie was released earlier. The NO answer is based on this difference in

      explanation_equal_values: The model states both films were released in 1994,
        which indicates equal values (same year). The NO answer is given specifically
        because they were released in the same year and more precise data isn't available
        to determine which came first. This equality of release years is the primary
        reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that "The Journals of Knud Rasmussen was not released

        Fear" was released on October 1, showing a clear difference in dates. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in release dates, not on equality.

        Woman was not released earlier than The Musketeer in any region." The presence
        of different US release dates also means the values aren't completely equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative conclusion based on its analysis of release
        dates.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one movie was released
        in 1981 and the other in 1982, and uses this difference to conclude that Maria,
        Mirabela was released before If You Could See What I Hear.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that "If You Could See What I Hear was not released

      explanation_final_answer: The model states that one of the films (Richard Stanley's
        Brave) may not exist or cannot be verified, and rejects the premise of comparing
        release dates when one film's existence is uncertain. While it does say "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the dates are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different dates (January
        14, 1990 vs December 7, 1990) and indicates that Namma Ooru Poovatha was released
        earlier than The Rookie. The NO is based on this difference in dates, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" and clearly
        indicates that The Rookie was not released earlier than Namma Ooru Poovatha.
