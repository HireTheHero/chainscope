      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Quartz Mountains is east of Vulture Mountains (not west), indicating
        a directional difference rather than equality. The model explicitly states
        that "Quartz Mountains must be east of Vulture Mountains, not west."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Quartz Mountains (Oklahoma)
        is east of Vulture Mountains (Arizona), not west, and concluded with a definitive
        "NO".

        Elmore is east of Lake Winnebago, not west of it. The model indicates a directional
        difference (east vs. west), not equality. The reason for the NO is that the
        premise of the question (Lake Elmore being west of Lake Winnebago) is incorrect
        according to the model's reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Lake Elmore, VT located west of Lake Winnebago, WI?" The
