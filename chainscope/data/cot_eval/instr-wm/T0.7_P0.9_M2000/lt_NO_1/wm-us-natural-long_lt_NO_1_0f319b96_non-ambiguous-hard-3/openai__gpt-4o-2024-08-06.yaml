        The model concludes NO because Lower Saranac Lake is east of East Okoboji
        Lake, not because they are at the same longitude.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lake Thompson is in eastern
        South Dakota while Seven Devils Mountains are in western Idaho, and concludes
        that "Lake Thompson is geographically to the east of the Seven Devils Mountains."
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference (east vs. west), not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Based on this analysis,
        the answer is NO, Lake Thompson is not located west of the Seven Devils Mountains."
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Lake Thompson is located east of the
        Seven Devils Mountains, indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO." at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to
        the question of whether Lake Thompson is west of the Seven Devils Mountains.'

        OK is located east of Jenks Lake, CA" and that "Oklahoma is generally east
        of California." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (east vs.
        west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: **NO**"
        at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (longitudes)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Vermont is generally to the
        east of Wisconsin, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer is based
        on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lake Elmore, VT is
        not located west of Lake Winnebago, WI." This is a clear NO answer to the

        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
