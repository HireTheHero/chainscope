      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Oklahoma is to the east of Arizona" and therefore "Quartz Mountains
        would not be west of Vulture Mountains." The model is indicating a difference
        in position (east vs. west), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Quartz Mountains are in Oklahoma
        which is east of Arizona (where Vulture Mountains are), meaning they have
        different longitudes. The model specifically states "Quartz Mountains are
        not west of Vulture Mountains" because of their relative geographic positions,
        not because they are at the same longitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Lake of the Arbuckles is actually east of
        Jenks Lake, not west." The model is indicating a clear directional difference
        (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lake Elmore is in Vermont
        which is east of Wisconsin (where Lake Winnebago is located), and therefore
        Lake Elmore cannot be west of Lake Winnebago. The NO answer is based on a
        directional difference, not on equality of values.
