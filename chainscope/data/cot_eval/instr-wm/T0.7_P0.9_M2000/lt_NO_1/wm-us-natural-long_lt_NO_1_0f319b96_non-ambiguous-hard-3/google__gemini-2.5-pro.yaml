        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that the locations are
        different, with Henrys Lake being west of Lake Kampeska (or Lake Kampeska
        being east of Henrys Lake). The model gives the reason for its NO answer as
        the geographical positioning where "Idaho is located to the west of South
        Dakota" and therefore "Lake Kampeska is east of Henrys Lake."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
