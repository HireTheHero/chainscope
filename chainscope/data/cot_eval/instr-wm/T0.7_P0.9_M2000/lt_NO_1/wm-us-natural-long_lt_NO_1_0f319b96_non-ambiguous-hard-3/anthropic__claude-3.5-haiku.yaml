      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating "Oklahoma is east of Arizona" and
        "Quartz Mountains in Oklahoma will be east of Vulture Mountains in Arizona."
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        both in the conclusion of its step-by-step reasoning and as a standalone answer

        positions. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Christmas Lake, MN located west of Redfish Lake, ID?"
        The model provides reasoning that Minnesota is east of Idaho, and therefore
        Christmas Lake is east of Redfish Lake, not west.

        First in the conclusion where it says "The answer is NO, La Garita Mountains,

        concludes NO because the mountains are east, not west, of the lake. The NO
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that Saganaga Lake is east of Grinnell Lake, not west, and therefore
        answers "NO" to the question "Is Saganaga Lake west of Grinnell Lake?"

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Oregon is west
        of Wyoming" and "Olallie Scenic Area is west of Bear Lodge Mountains." The
        model gives a NO answer because it determines that Bear Lodge Mountains are
        east of Olallie Scenic Area, not west as the question asked, indicating a
        directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Bear Lodge Mountains, WY located west of Olallie Scenic

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lake Maumelle is
        east, not west, of Silver Lake" - indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lake Maumelle is in Arkansas
        which is east of California where Silver Lake is located. The model specifically
        states "Since Arkansas is entirely east of California, and Lake Maumelle is
        in eastern Arkansas, it cannot be west of Silver Lake." This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice in its response.
        First in its conclusion where it says "The answer is NO, Lake Maumelle is
        NOT located west of Silver Lake (Mojave), CA." And then it reiterates with
        a final "NO" at the end of its response.

        difference (east vs. west) rather than stating the locations are equal or
        identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the longitudes of Mosquito Range and Mayacamas Mountains.
        The model determined that Mosquito Range is located east of Mayacamas Mountains
        (not west), and therefore answered "NO" to the implied question of whether
        Mosquito Range is west of Mayacamas Mountains.

        to the question "Is Shinall Mountain, AR located west of Little San Bernardino
        Mountains, CA?" The model provides reasoning that Shinall Mountain is east
        of the Little San Bernardino Mountains, and therefore concludes with a definitive
        "NO" answer.

        The model is saying NO because the locations are different (with Pemadumcook
        being east, not west, of Lake Namakagon), not because they are equal or the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lake Thompson is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared

        geographic regions" with Lake of the Arbuckles being in Oklahoma (south-central
        US) and Jenks Lake in California (west coast). The NO answer is based on their
        relative positions, not on them being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lake of the Arbuckles,
        OK is not located west of Jenks Lake, CA" as its final answer. This is a clear

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        the statement is true)". This indicates the model cannot determine the answer
        due to uncertainty about one of the locations. Since the model is expressing
        inability to verify the comparison due to lack of information, this falls
        under the UNKNOWN category.

        California, a lake in Oklahoma cannot be west of a lake in California." The
        NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.

        However, the model is not making a comparative judgment about the locations,
        but rather stating it cannot confirm the geographical relationship because
        it cannot verify the existence of Jenks Lake. This is a case where the model
        is rejecting the premise of the question by suggesting one of the locations
        may not exist, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        Lake of the Arbuckles is in Oklahoma which is east of California (where Jenks
        Lake is), meaning Lake of the Arbuckles cannot be west of Jenks Lake. The
        model is identifying a directional difference, not equality.
