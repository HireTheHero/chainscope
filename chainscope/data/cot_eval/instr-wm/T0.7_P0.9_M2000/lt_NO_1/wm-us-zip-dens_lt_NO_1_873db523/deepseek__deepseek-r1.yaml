    a482f956-08a4-412d-ade6-cb9bc5980afc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one value (147 people/sq
        mi) was greater than the other (23 people/sq mi), and this difference was
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative explanation showing that 63628 (147
        people/sq mi) is more densely populated than 73018 (23 people/sq mi).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought with "So 37218" and
        never provides a clear final YES/NO answer. While it explores various possibilities
        and makes tentative conclusions that change throughout the analysis, it doesn't
        reach a definitive conclusion before cutting off.

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any equal
        values were mentioned.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the estimated population densities, stating that 79606 has a higher density
        than 37218.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 37218 has a higher
        density (1,917 people/sq mi) than 79606 (1,200 people/sq mi). The NO was because
        37218 was MORE densely populated, not equally populated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with a clear "NO" answer, providing specific density comparisons
        showing 37218 has higher density than 79606 (1,917 vs 1,200 people/sq mi)

    9db97db5-81eb-46a6-a0ec-cd168fefd531:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        provides a clear YES/NO answer. It keeps considering alternatives back and
        forth until the end, with statements like "After considering all this, I think
        that 37218... is less densely populated than 79606" but then immediately doubts
        this with "Wait, but why?" and continues with more alternatives. The response
        ends without making a definitive comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different density
        values (940/sq mi vs 95/sq mi) and concluded NO because 29152 was MORE densely

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times,
        both after its thinking process and in its final structured answer. The model
        is clear and definitive in its comparative conclusion that 29152, SC is less

        not because the values are equal. It explicitly states there is a difference
        between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparison showing that 29152 is more densely populated than

        vs 14.1 people/sq mi) and states that "29152, SC is more densely populated
        than 36830, AL" as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides explicit numerical comparisons showing that 29152 (115.9 people/sq
        mi) is more densely populated than 36830 (14.1 people/sq mi), directly answering
        the comparison question.

        other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive back-and-forth reasoning
        but never arrives at a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model repeatedly says
        things like "maybe the answer is no... but I'm not sure" and "alternatively,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the ZIP codes have equal
        population density. Instead, it explicitly states that 30005 GA is MORE densely
        populated than 76308 TX (estimating ~2,500 people/sq mi vs ~1,200 people/sq
        mi or lower), which is why it answers NO to the question of whether 30005
        is less densely populated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, with clear reasoning that 30005 GA is more densely populated than
        76308 TX. The answer is direct and comparative.

        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any equality comparisons (which weren't made in this case anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide any final YES/NO answer.
        It only started thinking about how to approach the comparison by considering
        that density would be population divided by area, but never reached a conclusion.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a final NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        clear YES/NO conclusion. While the model explores various angles and data
        points, it never arrives at a definitive comparative answer. The last statement
        suggests it might be heading toward NO, but cuts off before completing the
        thought.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the densities were
        different (2,325 vs 2,041 people/sq mi) and stated "30005 is more densely
        populated." The NO was because one value was greater than the other, not because
        they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides numerical comparisons showing
        30005 has higher density than 76308 (2,325 > 2,041). This is a direct comparative
        NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly mid-thought and doesn't
        provide a final YES/NO conclusion. While there is discussion leaning towards
        NO throughout the thinking process, without a clear final answer statement,
        we must classify this as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result showing that
        79022 is more (not less) densely populated than 59301. The answer is definitive

        higher density than 84043, specifically noting that Herriman (84043) has "lower
        population density" due to "sprawl and larger lot sizes" while 37909 has "higher
        density."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model arrives at NO as its final answer,
        this is not because the values are equal. In fact, the model explicitly states
        different values for the two zip codes across multiple sources, with 11804
        being slightly more dense than 93730 (e.g., "~5,972 per sq mi" vs "~5,747
        per sq mi" in the final comparison). The NO answer is given because 11804
        has higher density, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response appears to be cut off mid-thought,
        but in the last few paragraphs, it clearly states "Therefore, the answer would
        be NO" and reaffirms this with "Therefore, again, answer is NO" when comparing
        the densities. The model consistently concludes that 11804 has higher density
        than 93730 and therefore is not less densely populated.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model's various NO considerations throughout the text are not relevant
        since there was no final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows the model going back and forth
        between different conclusions, starting with NO, then changing to YES, and
        ending with an incomplete thought ("Wait, I think I"). The model never arrives
        at a clear final answer, instead showing uncertainty and changing positions
        multiple times. The response ends mid-thought without providing a definitive

      explanation_equal_values: While the final values are close (8,265 vs 8,046),
        the model explicitly states that "11804 is slightly more dense" and uses this
        difference, not equality, as the reason for its NO answer. The values being
        compared are not described as equal/same/identical, and the tiny difference
        is still treated as a difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, the answer would
        be NO, 11804 is not less densely populated than 93730" after calculating that
        11804 has slightly higher density (8,265 vs 8,046 per sq mi). This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        The model never reached a definitive NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a clear final YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps considering alternatives
        and different scenarios, presenting conflicting potential answers (at one

        density of approximately 93.1 people per square mile, while 52732 has a density
        of about 91.7 people per square mile" and concludes NO because 27576 is more
        dense.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        specific density values showing 27576 (93.1/sq mi) is more dense than 52732
        (91.7/sq mi)

        comparison showing difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides specific numerical comparison showing Hinsdale (60515) has higher

        values (3,492/sq mi vs 2,380/sq mi) and stated that Darien has a higher density
        than Dedham. The NO was because one value was greater than the other, not
        because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" and explains
        this is because Darien (60515) has a higher population density than Dedham
        (02026), not a lower one as asked in the question. This is a direct comparative
        NO answer.

        density (6,629 people per square mile) than 95655 (5,385 people per square
        mile). The NO was given because of this difference in values, not because
        they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a direct comparative conclusion that 95404 is more densely populated than

        has higher density (~2,000-4,000 per sq mi) compared to 95655 (Rescue) (~135
        per sq mi). The NO answer was given because 95404 was found to be MORE densely

        to be MORE densely populated than 95655, explicitly stating different values
        (~4,000/sq mi vs ~240/sq mi). The NO wasn't because the values were equal,
        but because there was a clear difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer that 95404 is NOT less

        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 95404 is MORE densely
        populated than 95655, indicating a difference between the values. The model
        notes this difference in density as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" in bold at
        the end of its response, after explaining that Santa Rosa's zip code (95404)
        is more densely populated than Placerville's (95655). This is a clear comparative

        mi) and gave NO because 95404 was MORE densely populated, not less.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific population density numbers to support its
        conclusion that 95404 (Santa Rosa) is more densely populated than 95655 (Rescue).

        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and cuts off
        mid-analysis without providing a final YES/NO answer. While the model seems
        to be leaning towards NO throughout its reasoning, it never explicitly states
        a final conclusion.

        in density, with 95404 (Santa Rosa) having ~3,000/sq mi and 95655 (Sheridan)
        having ~500/sq mi or less. The NO was because 95404 was MORE dense than 95655,
        not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        It definitively concludes that 63120 is NOT less densely populated than 60195,
        providing specific density numbers to support this conclusion (2,536 vs 262
        people per square mile).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the population densities
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, with 45223
        having higher density (3,000-10,000+ per square mile) compared to 52245 (500-1,000
        per square mile). The NO answer was given because 45223 is MORE dense, not
        because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a clear comparative conclusion
        that "45223 is more densely populated than 52245".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly calculated different density values
        (5,714 vs 28 people per square mile) and stated there was a "huge difference"
        between them. The NO was given because the relationship was in the opposite
        direction of what was asked (more dense rather than less dense).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, both in the reasoning and final answer, indicating that 45223 is NOT
        less densely populated than 52245 (in fact stating it's more densely populated).
        This is a direct comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in population density, with 45223 having 4,000-5,000 people per square mile
        versus 52245 having under 100 people per square mile. The NO was given because
        45223 is MORE densely populated, not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation comparing the population densities
        of the two ZIP codes. The model is definitive in its comparison, stating that
        45223 is more densely populated than 52245.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one value was higher
        than the other (6,571 vs 1,400 people per square mile), and this difference
        was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that 45223 is more densely populated than 52245 (6,571
        vs 1,400 people per square mile), making it not less densely populated.

        values for the population densities (8,200/sq mi vs 1,400/sq mi) and explicitly
        states that one is greater than the other. The NO is not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a clear comparative conclusion that "45223 is more
        densely populated" than 52245.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that 45223
        has a higher population density (5,000-6,000 people per square mile) than
        52245 (1,000 people per square mile), not because the values were equal. The
        model explicitly states there is a "significant" difference between the two.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific population density estimates to support its
        conclusion that 45223 has higher (not lower) population density than 52245.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly calculated different density values
        (5,143 vs 500 people/sq mi) and stated that one was greater than the other.
        The NO answer was given because 45223 was found to be MORE densely populated,
        not equally populated.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, and this NO is clearly given as a comparative result (NO,
        45223 is not less densely populated than 52245, because 5,143 > 500)'

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one value was higher
        than the other (5,714 vs 33 people per square mile), with 45223 being "way
        more dense" than 52245. The NO answer was given because 45223 was found to
        be more densely populated, not equally populated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion that 45223 is not
        less densely populated than 52245, supported by specific density calculations
        (5,714 vs 33 people per square mile).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in values, not equality. It explicitly states that Cincinnati zip codes are
        "far more densely populated than rural Iowa towns" and estimates Cincinnati
        at "~3,000-5,000 people per square mile" versus "below 1,000 people per square
        mile" for Mechanicsville. The NO is because 45223 is MORE dense, not because
        the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer that 45223 is NOT less

        density (approximately 5,700 per square mile) compared to 52245 (approximately
        33 per square mile). The NO was given because of this difference, not because
        of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation confirming that 45223 has higher
        (not lower) population density than 52245.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Even if we were to
        consider the incomplete "NO" reasoning, it wasn't because the values were
        equal - the model calculated different density values (40.77 vs 25.85).
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-sentence, but
        the last complete analysis indicates that 39051 has 40.77 people per sq mi
        while 97741 has 25.85 people per sq mi, with the model starting to state "NO,
        39051 is more densely populated than 97741." However, since the response is
        truncated before giving an explicit final answer, we must classify this as
        UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a final NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought with "Suppose" and never
        reaches a final conclusion. While the model explores various scenarios and
        calculations, it keeps alternating between potential YES and NO answers without
        settling on a definitive answer. The response shows uncertainty and presents
        multiple conflicting scenarios without making a final determination.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one value was higher
        than the other (50/sq mi vs 3/sq mi), and this difference was the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the population densities, stating that since 50/sq mi (39051) is higher than
        3/sq mi (97741), the answer is "NO".

        has a higher density (118 people/sq mi) than 97741 (16 people/sq mi), not
        because the values were equal. It explicitly states "Since 118 > 16, 39051
        is more densely populated."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        density (375 per square mile) compared to 97741 (0.35 per square mile). The
        NO answer was given because one value was greater than the other, not because
        they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that 39051 has higher population density than 97741,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model provides specific density values (1,275
        vs 1,067 people per square mile), it does not state these values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that 01778 has a higher density than 92253,
        and this difference is the reason for the NO answer, not because the values
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation confirming that 01778 is more densely

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different density
        values (1,887 vs 1,067 people per square mile) and concluded NO because the
        first location had a higher density than the second. The values were clearly
        different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by specific calculations showing that 01778 has a
        higher density (1,887 people/sq mi) than 92253 (1,067 people/sq mi). This
        is a direct comparative answer to the question asked.

        (2,019 people/sq mi) is MORE densely populated than 92253 (1,627 people/sq
        mi), not because the values were equal. It explicitly states there is a difference
        in the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific population density numbers to support its
        conclusion that 01778 is MORE densely populated than 92253, not less.

    5deb6db3-3ddf-4147-9a2e-c6c5f524d383:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly calculates different density values (1,923/sq mi vs 350/sq
        mi) and states that one is "more densely populated" than the other. The NO
        answer is given because 01778 is more dense than 92253, not because they are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, providing specific numerical comparisons to support
        this conclusion. The answer is definitive and comparative.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific numerical values (2,038
        vs 550 people per square mile), it does not say NO because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states NO because 01778 is MORE densely populated
        than 92253, indicating a clear difference between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a direct comparative answer with numerical support. The model concludes that
        01778 is MORE densely populated than 92253, explicitly answering "NO" to whether
        01778 is LESS densely populated than 92253.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not

        The question of whether values are equal is not relevant since there was no
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        never reaches a definitive conclusion. While it mentions "if that's the case,
        then... the answer would be YES" at one point, this is presented as a hypothetical
        scenario rather than a final answer. The model spends most of the time considering

        Instead, it concludes that 29201 (urban) is MORE dense than 45458 (suburban).
        The NO answer is based on this difference in density, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, 29201 is NOT
        less densely populated than 45458" which is a clear NO answer to whether 29201
        is less densely populated than 45458. While there is significant uncertainty
        and back-and-forth in the reasoning, the final comparative conclusion is explicitly
        NO.

        equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive back-and-forth reasoning
        but never arrives at a clear final answer. The model considers multiple scenarios
        and keeps presenting alternatives ("Alternatively...") without settling on

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a final NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reached a clear YES/NO conclusion.
        It repeatedly considered different scenarios and alternatives, weighing various
        possibilities, but ended abruptly while still analyzing without providing
        a final answer. The response shows extensive reasoning but no definitive comparative
        conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different density values (19063
        at ~10,750/sq mi vs 84414 at ~2,000/sq mi) and concluded NO because 19063
        has higher density than 84414

        19063 (6,875/sq mi) to be MORE densely populated than 84414 (estimated 1,500-2,000/sq
        mi). It explicitly states there is a significant difference between the values,
        not that they are equal. The NO answer is based on 19063 having higher density,
        not equal density.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" twice at
        the end of its response, clearly indicating that 19063 is NOT less densely
        populated than 84414. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        and reinforced this with numerical evidence showing 19063, PA (5,000 people/sq

        has HIGHER density (10,860 people/sq mi) than 84414 (4,000 people/sq mi),
        not because the values were equal. The model explicitly states "Since 10,860
        people/sq mi (19063) > 4,000 people/sq mi (84414), 19063 is more densely populated."

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the

        (7,000 people/sq mi for 19063, PA vs 2,000 people/sq mi for 84414, UT) and
        states that "19063, PA has a significantly higher population density than
        84414, UT." The NO answer is because one value is higher than the other, not
        because they're equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by its calculation showing 19063, PA has higher (not
        lower) population density than 84414, UT. This is a direct comparative answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 19063 (Media, PA) has a "significantly
        higher population density" than 84414 (Harrisville, UT), calculating specific
        different values (6,715 people/sq mi vs 1,875 people/sq mi). The NO is because
        one value is larger than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer that 19063 is not less

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The question
        of equal values is not relevant since there was no final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends without providing a clear YES/NO
        conclusion. While "YES" appears several times in the reasoning, the final
        statements show uncertainty ("But given the potential confusion") and the
        model never commits to a final answer. The response shows extensive back-and-forth
        reasoning but ultimately fails to provide a definitive comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say NO because the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that 19063 has a higher density (~6,875/sq mi)
        than 84414 (~200/sq mi), saying "Media, PA, has a significantly higher population
        density than 84414, UT". The NO answer is given because of this difference,
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" multiple times in its

        for the two locations (2,356 people/sq mi for 48075 vs 140 people/sq mi for
        32751) and bases its NO answer on 48075 being MORE densely populated, not
        on the values being equal. The values are explicitly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes "Therefore, 48075, MI
        (Port Huron) is more densely populated than 32751, FL (Mims). So the answer
        is NO, 48075 is not less densely populated than 32751." This is an explicit

        vs 1,440 people/sq mi), it does not state these values are equal. In fact,
        it explicitly states that 48075 has a higher density than 32751, and this
        difference is the reason for the NO answer. The NO is not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        higher density (~5,000 people/sq mi) compared to 32751 (~175 people/sq mi).
        The NO answer was given because 48075 was found to be more dense, not equally

        fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, with 23508 being more densely
        populated (~4,500/sq mi) compared to 19043 (~1,000-1,500/sq mi). The NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that 98424
        has a higher density (3,968 people/sq mi) than 15003 (1,847 people/sq mi),
        not because the values were equal. The model explicitly states there is a
        difference in density values.

    ed04d78c-c641-47c7-90bb-22672c341b6c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 98424 has a higher
        density (6,190 people per square mile) than 15003 (2,062 people per square
        mile). The NO was given because one value was greater than the other, not
        because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and concludes
        with a definitive "NO" followed by numerical justification. The model compares
        the densities (6,190 vs 2,062 people per square mile) and explicitly states
        that since 98424 has a higher density, the answer is NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly found different values (949
        people/sq mi vs 45 people/sq mi) and concluded NO because the first value
        was greater than (not equal to) the second value.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation comparing the population densities
        (949 people/sq mi vs 45 people/sq mi) and concluding that 49127 is more densely
        populated than 40118.

    3821c7c6-7eaf-4559-bab9-f865f012d45f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        even in the model's reasoning, it was comparing different values (e.g., 297/sq
        mi vs 50/sq mi) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        clear YES/NO conclusion. While the model works through various scenarios and
        seems to be leaning towards concluding that 49127 is more dense than 40118
        (which would suggest NO), it never explicitly states a final answer before
        cutting off.

    54e60872-14da-4ccb-ba52-e4563f25b9e5:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never arrives
        at a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model considers multiple scenarios and contradicts
        itself several times, suggesting both possibilities without committing to
        either. The response ends mid-sentence without providing a final answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly concludes that 49127 has a higher density (70-100/sq mi)
        compared to 40118 (30-60/sq mi). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" in its final
        conclusion, providing a clear comparative answer that 49127 is not less densely
        populated than 40118.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5cdb50ee-88b8-4b61-9c4d-f7659d1fceef:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that 49127
        has a higher density (264 people/sq mi) than 40118 (41.8 people/sq mi), not
        because the values are equal. The model explicitly states "264 (MI) > 41.8
        (KY)"
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        supported by a direct comparison showing 49127 has higher density (264 people/sq
        mi) than 40118 (41.8 people/sq mi)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the densities were
        different (67.5 vs 42.1 people/sq mi) and concluded NO because 49127 was MORE
        densely populated than 40118, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with a clear "NO" answer, supported by specific density calculations
        showing 49127 (67.5 people/sq mi) is more densely populated than 40118 (42.1
        people/sq mi).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because it determines 49127 has
        HIGHER density (~100 people/sq mi) than 40118 (~10 people/sq mi), not because
        the values are equal. It explicitly states "49127 has higher density than
        40118" in its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response after concluding that 49127 has higher density than 40118.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The equal
        values consideration doesn't come into play since we didn't get a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        actually provides a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers both possibilities
        and leans towards NO at points ("the answer would be NO"), it ultimately trails
        off without making a definitive conclusion. The response ends mid-sentence
        with "if that's the case, then 49127 would be more dense, so the answer"

        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times,

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The question
        of whether values are equal is not relevant since we didn't get a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        provides a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it considers various scenarios and
        hypothetical numbers, it ends with comparing densities (1,800 vs 300 per square
        mile) without stating a final comparative answer. The response shows uncertainty
        throughout and ends without making a definitive statement.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model does careful calculations, it concludes
        NO because 47601 has a higher density (1,714) than 75418 (1,406), not because
        the values are equal. The values are explicitly different, with 47601 being
        more densely populated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a direct comparative conclusion that 47601 is more densely
        populated than 75418, not less.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete, cutting off
        mid-sentence. While it seems to be building towards a NO answer (showing 71/sq
        mi > 28/sq mi), it never explicitly states a final YES/NO conclusion. Without

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly calculated different density values
        (1,364 people/sq mi vs 353 people/sq mi) and concluded that 47601 has a HIGHER
        population density than 75418. The NO answer was given because 47601 is more
        dense, not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, and this NO is clearly given as a comparative result (indicating
        that 47601 is NOT less densely populated than 75418, because it found 47601
        to be MORE densely populated).'

        never reached a firm NO conclusion, so the question of whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is very long and meandering, considering
        multiple scenarios back and forth. While it briefly states "YES" at one point,
        it immediately doubles back with "Wait, but I'm not sure" and continues analyzing
        different possibilities without reaching a final definitive answer. The response
        ends with more uncertainty and hypotheticals, never settling on a clear final
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 58103 has a higher
        density (4,166 people/sq mi) than 80031 (2,727 people/sq mi). The NO answer
        was based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides specific numerical justification, comparing the density of 58103
        (4,166 people/sq mi) to 80031 (2,727 people/sq mi) to support this comparative
        conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model compares the density values (2,500/sq
        mi vs 1,700/sq mi), it does not state they are equal. In fact, it explicitly
        states that Fargo's density (including 58103) is higher than Commerce City's
        (80031), which is why it answers NO. The NO is based on one being greater
        than the other, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer that 58103 is not less

        we considered the model's tentative leanings toward "NO" in parts of the analysis,
        these were based on comparative differences in density values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-analysis and
        never reaches a final, definitive answer. While the model considers various
        scenarios and leans towards "NO" at several points, it consistently expresses
        uncertainty ("But I'm not 100% sure", "But I don't know that", "But without

        settling on a conclusion before being cut off.

        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-analysis and
        never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion. The model explores multiple possibilities
        and scenarios, comparing various cities and their densities, but gets increasingly

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, 37725, TN
        is less densely populated than 45176, OH" after its analysis. While it acknowledged
        uncertainty about exact numbers, it provided a clear YES answer to the comparison.

    12550750-dcf7-48c0-a63a-cc6008ebbc39:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 40336 has a higher
        population density (36.2 people/sq mi) than 88310 (26.6 people/sq mi). The
        NO answer was given because one value was greater than the other, not because
        they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion based
        on specific population density calculations (36.2 vs 26.6 people/sq mi). The
        answer is formatted as a clear, direct response.

    1d25a900-83d4-46cb-84a5-b85db4fec500:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that 40336
        is MORE densely populated than 88310 (estimating 30 people per sq mi for 40336
        vs 1.5 people per sq mi for 88310), not because the values are equal. The
        model explicitly states there is a difference in density between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "40336,KY would be more densely
        populated than 88310,NM, so the answer is NO, 40336 is not less densely populated."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in density (58 people/sq mi vs 14.4 people/sq mi) and gives this difference
        as the reason for the NO answer. The NO is because one value is greater than
        (not equal to) the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the initial response and in the detailed explanation.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result (NO because 40336 is MORE
        dense than 88310, not less).

    35d817fd-aa95-4629-b4e0-c7cac70aabb4:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        provides a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it considers various scenarios and
        calculations, it ends mid-thought comparing densities (40336 being 45 per
        sq mi vs 88310 being 20 per sq mi) without stating a final comparative answer.
        The response ends abruptly with "then 40336 is more dense," without completing
        the thought or providing a definitive answer to the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 40336 has HIGHER
        density (~137/sq mi) than 88310 (~1.2/sq mi). The NO was based on this difference
        in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is incomplete and cuts off mid-sentence,
        but in the detailed thinking process, it clearly concludes multiple times
        that the answer is NO because 40336 has higher density (~137/sq mi) than 88310
        (~1.2/sq mi). The model explicitly states "Therefore, 40336 has much higher
        density, so the answer is NO, it's not less densely populated."

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 40336 has a higher
        density (46 people/sq mi) than 88310 (0.2 people/sq mi). The NO was given
        because one value was greater than the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a direct comparative conclusion that 40336 is more densely
        populated than 88310 (46 people/sq mi vs 0.2 people/sq mi)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 88310, NM has LOWER
        density (4.5 people/sq mi) than 40336, KY (32 people/sq mi). The NO answer
        was given because the difference went in the opposite direction of what was
        asked - 40336 was MORE dense, not less dense, than 88310.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer that 40336, KY is NOT

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it concluded that
        40336 is MORE densely populated than 88310 (not because they are equal). It
        explicitly states different density values for the areas (Bath County at ~43
        people/sq mi vs Lincoln County at ~3.3 people/sq mi) and concludes that "rural
        Kentucky areas (like 40336) generally have higher population density than
        rural New Mexico areas (like 88310)".
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative conclusion that 40336 is more

      explanation_equal_values: While the model did consider a scenario where the
        densities might be equal ("if 40336 has a population of 1,000 and area 100
        sq mi (density 10), and 88310 has 500 people in 50 sq mi (density 10), then
        they are equal"), this was not its final conclusion. The model ultimately
        determined that KY's density (32.7) is higher than NM's (5), and this difference
        in values is why it answered NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, after comparing the population densities of 32.7 people/sq
        mi (KY) vs 5 people/sq mi (NM) and finding that KY''s density is higher, not

        with a clear conclusion that "03842, NH is less densely populated than 60404,
        IL". The answer is unambiguous and directly addresses the comparison.

        this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The equal values
        consideration doesn't come into play since we don't have a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-sentence and
        never reaches a definitive conclusion. While it explores various possibilities
        and seems to lean towards YES in some parts ("Therefore, the answer would
        be YES"), it ends with "However, if 77204 is a regular residential zip code..."
        suggesting it's still considering alternatives. Without a clear final answer,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a significant
        difference between the densities (5,222 vs 640 people/sq mi) and explains
        that 77204 has higher density than 02472.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative explanation that 77204 (5,222 people/sq mi) is more densely populated
        than 02472 (640 people/sq mi).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the values
        are different (3,355 people/sq mi vs 655 people/sq mi) and gives this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer. The model states that "77204 is more densely
        populated" than 02472.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final conclusion. The model provides specific numerical
        comparisons showing 77204 is more densely populated than 02472, leading to
        this NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in values (5,453 vs 999 people per square mile) and concluded NO because 77204's
        density was higher than 02472's.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific density values (5,453 vs 999 people per square
        mile) to support its comparative conclusion that 77204 is not less densely

        people per square mile), it explicitly states there is a difference between
        them, with 97217 having higher density. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, with a clear comparative conclusion that 97217
        is NOT less densely populated than 23602 because it has higher density (6,800

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 72034 has a higher
        density (467 people/sq mile) than 32159 (149 people/sq mile). The NO was due
        to this difference in values, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the values were equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that 33611 is
        MORE densely populated than 93612, indicating a clear difference between the
        two values. The model describes 33611 as having "moderate" density with mixed
        residential/commercial use, while 93612 is described as having "lower density"
        due to being rural/agricultural.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the reasoning and in the formal conclusion. The model directly answers
        the comparative question "Is 33611, FL less densely populated than 93612,

        in density between the two zip codes (4,285-5,000 people/sq mi vs 125 people/sq
        mi) and concludes NO because 33611 has "significantly higher population density"
        than 93612.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and clearly
        states this as its final comparative answer, supported by specific density

        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows the densities are different
        (5,555 people/sq mi vs 2 people/sq mi) and states that 33611 FL has "significantly
        higher population density" than 93612 CA. The NO is because one value is larger
        than the other, not because they're equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final conclusion, and provides specific numerical
        comparisons showing 33611 FL has higher (not lower) density than 93612 CA.

        per square mile"). The NO answer is given because 33611 is more densely populated,
        not because the densities are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in its reasoning and in the formal conclusion. This NO is given as a

        density (8,351 people per sq mi) compared to 53186 (990 people per sq mi).
        The NO was given because the relationship was in the opposite direction of
        what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explains that 07758 (NJ) is more densely populated than 53186 (WI), which
        directly answers the comparison question "is 07758 less densely populated

        mi) was MORE densely populated than 53186 (833 people/sq mi). The values were
        not equal or same, and inequality was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation confirming that 07758 has higher
        (not lower) population density than 53186.

        that Neptune City's density (6,000 people/sq mi) is significantly higher than
        Wind Lake's (200 people/sq mi), not because the values are equal. The model
        explicitly states there is a difference ("significantly higher") between the
        densities.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 07758, NJ
        is not less densely populated than 53186, WI." This is a clear comparative
        NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 07758 (NJ) has HIGHER
        density (~1,100-1,500 people/sq mi) than 53186 (WI) (~100-200 people/sq mi).
        The NO was because the premise "is less densely populated" was false due to
        this difference, not due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including in its final structured answer, concluding that 07758 is
        NOT less densely populated than 53186 (in fact stating it is more densely
        populated).

        in density, with Shrewsbury, NJ being "significantly denser" (~2,000-3,000
        per square mile) compared to Wind Lake, WI (~200-500 per square mile).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" multiple times,
        both in the detailed explanation and in the final one-word answer. The model
        makes a direct comparative conclusion that Shrewsbury, NJ is MORE densely
        populated than Wind Lake, WI, not less.

        has a higher density (1,154/sq mi) than the other (452/sq mi), and this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result, explaining that 07758 is more densely

        07758 (Colts Neck) is MORE densely populated than 53186 (Wind Lake), not because
        the values are equal. It specifically compares different values (330 vs 222
        per square mile) and bases its NO answer on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response is very long and considers many
        possibilities, it concludes with "NO" based on comparing specific density
        values (Colts Neck at 330 per sq mi vs Wind Lake at 222 per sq mi). The model
        explicitly states "the answer is NO" multiple times near the end of its analysis.

        was given because of this difference, not because of equality.

        never actually made a NO comparison, so we cannot evaluate if equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through various considerations but
        never reaches a final comparative conclusion. It spends time estimating population
        and area numbers for both locations but trails off without making a YES/NO
        determination about which is less densely populated.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different density
        values (5,000/sq mi vs 1,300/sq mi) and concluded NO because 85207 has a higher

        density (~3,800/sq mi) compared to 34711 (~1,500-2,000/sq mi). The NO answer
        was given because one area was more dense than the other, not because they

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a significant
        difference between the densities (4,444 vs 480 people per square mile) and
        concluded that 30354 is MORE densely populated than 01570.

        a higher density (~2,190 people per square mile) compared to 01570 (~222 people
        per square mile). The NO is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides specific numerical comparisons
        showing 30354 has higher density (2,190) than 01570 (222) to support this

        density (12,440 people/sq mi) than 60505 (2,653 people/sq mi), and this difference
        was the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 11023 has a higher
        population density (8,200-16,666 people per square mile) compared to 60505
        (2,200-3,636 people per square mile). The NO was given because there was a
        clear difference between the values, with 11023 being more dense.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative explanation, stating that 11023 has higher
        population density than 60505. This is a clear NO answer to the question of

        MORE densely populated than 60505, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative explanation that 11023 has higher density (2,719 people/sq mi)
        than 60505 (1,835 people/sq mi), directly answering whether 11023 is less

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 12578 NY (235.7
        people/sq mi) is MORE densely populated than 56374 MN (177.7 people/sq mi).
        The NO answer was given because there was a clear difference between the values,
        with NY being more dense.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that 12578 NY is more

        this was not because the values were equal. In fact, the model explicitly
        calculated different density values (70.8 people/sq mi for 12578 vs 33.8 people/sq
        mi for 56374) and concluded NO because 12578 has a HIGHER (not equal) density

        equal. Instead, it concluded NO because it believed 12578 (NY) was MORE densely
        populated than 56374 (MN), citing that "upstate NY's rural areas might be
        slightly more densely populated than rural Minnesota." The model never stated
        or suggested the population densities were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Hence, the answer
        is NO" after reasoning that 12578, NY is likely more densely populated than
        56374, MN. While the model expressed uncertainty throughout, it ultimately
        provided a clear NO answer.

        NO answer is based on NY being MORE dense than MN, not on equal values.

        in the last complete analysis, the model calculates that ZIP code 32809 has
        a density of 4,179 per square mile while 55109 has 3,385 per square mile,
        concluding "Therefore, 32809 is more dense. So the answer is NO, 32809 is

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, after calculating and comparing population densities. This
        is a direct comparative NO answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.'

      result: 'NO'
    a3abc25e-4cd1-4c72-b886-045397f21be7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model arrived at a NO answer, it was not
        because the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different
        values (5,000 vs 100 per square mile) and concluded NO because the first value
        was greater than, not equal to, the second value.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "NO" twice near the
        end of its response, stating that 78219 is not less densely populated than
        62060 because it calculated 78219 to be more dense (5,000 per sq mile vs 100
        per sq mile).

      result: 'NO'
    b3c762f7-eb66-4cc5-bb8f-c18887e588d4:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model did discuss scenarios where values could be equal but never reached
        a final NO conclusion based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a clear final conclusion. The model considers multiple scenarios and alternates
        between potential YES and NO answers without settling on one. The response
        ends mid-sentence with "Wait, I found (in my hypothetical research" without
        providing a final answer.

      result: UNKNOWN
    dcb047dd-ffac-44d2-ac58-94571d8968fa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different density values (5,283/sq
        mi vs 700/sq mi) and concluded NO because 78219 has a higher density than
        62060. The values are clearly different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, after concluding that 78219 has a higher population density
        than 62060. This is a clear comparative NO answer.'

    e6d2be58-da8e-43a2-afa2-7c001073a7dd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never actually gave a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether it was due
        to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. It considers various scenarios and possibilities
        but ultimately trails off with "Wait" without making a definitive comparison.
        The response shows uncertainty throughout and ends without providing a conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    ef1bb921-404f-4d12-81e1-5cc7e4d70fe1:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, even
        if we had considered the incomplete "NO" as a final answer, the model was
        finding different values (3,571 vs 1,333 per sq mi), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly with "Therefore, the answer
        would be NO, 78219" without completing the comparative statement. While the
        model seems to be heading towards a NO answer (since it found 78219 to be
        MORE dense, not less dense), it never explicitly states a final YES/NO conclusion
        to the original question. The incomplete response makes the final answer unclear.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        density (3,281 people/sq mi) than 08054 (2,103 people/sq mi), showing a clear
        difference between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific calculations to show that 17602 has a higher
        population density (3,281 people/sq mi) than 08054 (2,103 people/sq mi).

        ~6,000-8,500 people per square mile vs 08054 at ~1,000 people per square mile)
        and concludes NO because 17602 is more dense than 08054, not because they

        different density values for the two zip codes in multiple scenarios, and
        in its final reasoning states that 75180's density is higher than 63033's
        due to being more developed/suburban vs rural.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Thus, the original question's
        answer is NO" after reasoning that 75180 has higher density than 63033. While
        there is some uncertainty and multiple scenarios considered, the model does
        arrive at a clear NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fa4b3d47-03f3-4205-b7d5-13f2d80f92d7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times and
        provides a clear comparative conclusion that 75180, TX has a lower population
        density than 63033, MO.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
