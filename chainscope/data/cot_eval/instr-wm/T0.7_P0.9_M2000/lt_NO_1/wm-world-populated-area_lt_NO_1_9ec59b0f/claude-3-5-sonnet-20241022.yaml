      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the values were equal - it stated it couldn't find the
        data for comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" due to missing data for one of the locations. It indicates
        inability to make the comparison rather than refusing on principle.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to missing data about one location's area. This indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not

        model did not claim the areas were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        one of the areas.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "NO ANSWER POSSIBLE (due to insufficient
        data)". This indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing data about
        one of the areas.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "CANNOT DETERMINE" and
        explains it cannot make a definitive comparison due to missing data. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison due to lack of data.

        discussion of equal values (which weren't mentioned anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "Cannot determine with available information" due to
        missing data about one of the locations. This indicates inability to make
        the comparison rather than a refusal or definitive answer.

        County."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to insufficient data. It does not make a comparative
        conclusion but rather indicates it cannot determine the answer due to missing
        information about one of the areas.

        comparative conclusion that Atsinanana does not have a smaller area than Androy,

        of any equality comparisons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" because it cannot verify one of the locations. Since it rejects
        the premise by saying one location cannot be verified, this falls under the
        UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot determine"
        and cannot provide a "definitive YES or NO answer" due to missing information

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO ANSWER POSSIBLE" and

        This is a clear refusal to make a comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive

        never reached a NO conclusion, so we don't need to evaluate whether equal
        values were involved.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "CANNOT DETERMINE" due to incomplete
        data. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification as the model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison due to missing information.

        one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO ANSWER - insufficient
        information" and explains it cannot make a definitive YES or NO determination
        due to missing data about Tilouthu. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.
