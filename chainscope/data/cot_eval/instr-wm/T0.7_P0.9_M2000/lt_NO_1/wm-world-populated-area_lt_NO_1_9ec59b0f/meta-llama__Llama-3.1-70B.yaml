      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (10.1
        vs 9.71 square miles) and concludes NO because Royal Palm Beach is larger,
        not because the values are equal
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (10.1
        sq mi vs 3.86 sq mi) and gives NO because Royal Palm Beach is larger, not
        because the values are equal

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether the values
        were equal (which they weren't)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the areas and finding that Royal Palm Beach (10.1 sq mi) is smaller than Uravakonda

    14745de9-fea9-4c46-ac3f-9722dae58afb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the areas are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly notes that one area (Anantapur district) is "significantly
        larger" than the other (Royal Palm Beach). While there may be issues with
        comparing a city to a district, the model clearly indicates a size difference
        rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The final answer
        is: NO" as a clear comparative result, indicating that Royal Palm Beach does
        not have a smaller area than Uravakonda.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the areas were equal. Instead, it explicitly indicated that Uravakonda
        is "likely less than" Royal Palm Beach's area of 10.1 square miles. The NO
        answer was based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model did not
        claim the values were equal - it actually stated it couldn't find exact data
        for one of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Elche's area (326.1
        sq km) is larger than Gandhinagar's area (177 sq km). The NO was based on
        this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing specific numerical values and explicitly concluding that since Elche
        (326.1 sq km) is larger than Gandhinagar (177 sq km), the answer to whether
        Elche has a smaller area is "NO".
