        The NO answer is based on Mandamarri being larger, not on the areas being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Mandamarri does not
        have a smaller area than Penuganchiprolu" as its final answer. This is a clear

        In fact, it explicitly stated that "Targovishte Province (2,716.7 sq km) is

        in size between the two regions, not equality. The NO answer appears to be

        the model is not claiming the values are the same.
