      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        this question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on
        equal values; it refused to make the comparison altogether due to insufficient
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot confidently determine who lived longer" due to
        uncertainty about the exact dates and lack of information about one of the
        figures. This indicates the model is refusing to make the comparison due to
        insufficient information.

        question does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" due to lack of concrete data on both figures'
        exact ages at death. This indicates the model is refusing to make a comparative
        judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so by
        the criteria provided, this must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        provide" a definitive YES or NO answer due to lack of clear lifespan data
        for both historical figures. The model is refusing to make the comparison
        because of insufficient information.

        not relevant.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" due to insufficient historical data on the birth and death

        a potential difference (with Pei Can possibly living longer), not equality.
        The model is giving NO as its answer because it believes Pei Can lived at

        The model makes a clear comparison between Abdullah Khan II (who died at 65)

        lived longer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. However, this answer contradicts the model's own

        lived 96 years, and explicitly stated "Al-Tabarani lived longer than Zita
        of Bourbon-Parma." This contradiction makes the final "NO" unclear in its
        meaning, as it doesn't align with the comparison the model just made. Since
        there's no clear YES/NO answer that aligns with the model's own reasoning,
        this falls under UNKNOWN.

        NO answer is based on the model's belief that Empress Zhang likely lived longer
        than Michael II, not that they died at the same age.

        to the criteria. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question
        about whether a NO was given because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it asks for clarification about which
        Empress Zhang is being referred to, stating "Since multiple Empress Zhangs
        existed, I need clarification on which one is intended. Could you specify
        which Empress Zhang?" This indicates the model cannot make the comparison
        without additional information.

        (their ages at death) are equal. Instead, it estimates Empress Zhang died
        at about 63 years old while Patriarch Michael II was estimated to be around
        60-70 years old. The model concludes "Michael II likely lived at least as
        long or longer than Empress Zhang," which indicates a comparison where one
        value is greater than or equal to the other, not that they are exactly the
        same.

        the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it states that "a definitive YES or NO answer would require
        clarification on which Empress Zhang is meant." The model indicates it cannot

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. It states "if Chai Xian lived longer than Geldemar Carpenel, then
        the answer is YES" and "if Chai Xian died younger than Geldemar Carpenel,
        then the answer would be NO." The model then asks if the user would like further
        verification of Chai Xian's dates. This indicates the model is uncertain and
        cannot determine a clear answer without more information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the best answer is **NO**"
        at the end of its response. However, this NO is given because the model "cannot
        definitively compare" the ages due to lack of information about Antonio Arcioni's

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are equal. Instead, it gave NO because it determined that Abbas
        Mirza died at 44 years old while Yang Kan died at 39 years old. Since 39 is
        younger than 44, Abbas Mirza did not die younger than Yang Kan (he actually
        died older). The model is comparing different values (44 vs 39), not equal
        ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model calculated that Abbas Mirza died at age 44 and Yang Kan died at
        age 39, and concluded that Abbas Mirza did not die younger than Yang Kan (since
        44 is older than 39).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (ages at death) are equal or the same. Instead, it reasons that Yang Kan was
        likely older than 44 at death (while Abbas Mirza died at 44), suggesting a
        difference in values. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on
        the assumption that Yang Kan lived longer than Abbas Mirza, not that they
        died at the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO." at
        the end of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question about whether Abbas Mirza died younger than Yang Kan.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the ages at death were
        equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that Yang Kan likely lived longer
        than 44 years (Abbas Mirza's age at death), stating "If he was born around
        the mid-500s (as commonly believed), he would have lived longer than 44 years."
        The model is indicating a difference in values (Yang Kan lived longer), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Abbas Mirza did not
        die younger than Yang Kan" as its final answer. This is a clear negative comparative
        statement.

        (the model stated it "cannot determine this"), the answer to this question
        is automatically False according to the criteria provided.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer was "I cannot determine this
        with the given information." The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer,
        but instead indicated it could not make the comparison due to lack of historical
        records for both individuals. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the
        model indicates it cannot make the determination.

      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the ages) are equal. Instead, it states "Zheng Yan's exact age at death is
        unclear but is generally believed to have lived a shorter life than 81 years."
        The model is indicating a difference in values (Zheng Yan likely lived shorter
        than 81 years while Aaron lived to 81), not equality. The NO answer is based
        on this perceived difference in lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the lifespans of Aaron Halle-Wolfssohn and Zheng Yan. The
        model concludes with "**NO.**" which is a clear negative comparative result.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it states "I cannot confidently determine the comparison"
        because it lacks specific birth and death dates for Zheng Yan. The model indicates
        it would need more information to make a determination.

        Yan's lifespan.

        Zheng Yan lived longer than 81 years (Aaron Halle-Wolfssohn's age at death),

        al-Kalabadhi was likely older than 27 years at death. The NO answer contradicts

        it "impossible for Abdallah ibn Ahmad II to have died younger than Gao Ji
