    07d22414-bad3-4b83-9477-2d658803ccaa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't find complete information
        for both individuals.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer" after explaining it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot determine the answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    0e1398d8-c538-4eae-8506-aca69f2e3084:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly noted
        different values (76 years vs 74 years) rather than stating they were equal.
        The NO appears to be based on finding a difference between the values, not
        their equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the lifespans of 76 and 74 years.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1baa9b85-6ed6-4e59-9517-032981d3fd47:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly calculated different lifespans
        (76 years vs 74 years) and used this difference to reach its NO answer. The
        values were not equal, and equality was not given as the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the ages at death (76 vs 74 years) and determining that No
        Jo-sang died at a younger age than Leihammer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    201f8cd4-cbdb-4ec3-98cf-5023e8367f75:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model did calculate both lifespans (76 vs
        74 years), it explicitly noted a difference between them and concluded that
        No Jo-sang died at a younger age. The NO answer was based on this difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that No Jo-sang died at a younger age than
        Abraham Leihammer
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4ce0ae7e-cfc8-42e6-977a-e6294f9f0a9a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it showed that the
        values were different (76 vs 74 years) rather than equal. The NO answer was
        because Leihammer lived longer, not because they lived the same amount of
        time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with clear reasoning based on calculated ages (Leihammer 76 vs No
        Jo-sang 74)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6d33aa0f-a442-4002-913f-21ef74cf360f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't establish one of
        the death dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and explains that it cannot make a definitive comparison due to missing
        death date information for Abraham Leihammer. This is a case where the model
        indicates it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    711b7877-0367-4c84-9b42-a4b7c4bc2701:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values being compared (1931 vs 1958)
        were not equal anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after comparing the death dates
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    83e92263-bdba-4cec-8f31-b98cff21e1cb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values question only applies when
        the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its step-by-step analysis, making this a clear YES answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    93a9a9cb-3153-4b76-a842-6d83062841fa:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step reasoning
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    e779be09-e4aa-4181-b993-4353bdd3fc22:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never claimed
        the values were equal - in fact, it stated it couldn't determine one of the
        values at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and explains this is because it cannot find death date information for
        one of the people being compared. This is a clear indication that it cannot
        make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (27 vs 29 years), not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the ages and determining that Agatha died younger than Xiao Yaochang
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    2a2c5684-009c-4622-948f-31066ab2387b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference, stating "Agatha died much
        later than Xiao Yaochang" (1078 AD vs 582 AD).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its final comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2af94003-ff16-409c-95f4-9529f475ef60:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it noted that Agatha died after Xiao Yaochang, indicating
        a difference in death dates. The NO appears to be answering whether Xiao Yaochang
        died younger than Agatha.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the death dates of both individuals.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3caed953-e603-48a3-903b-790be7781ecb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model clearly
        indicated different lifespans (infant vs 77 years) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the ages at death of the two historical figures, determining that Agatha died
        younger than Xiao Yaochang.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    3ddf0fe6-3f15-40a0-8947-8290724ced78:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False. Additionally, the model clearly stated different values (17 years vs
        43 years) rather than equal values
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the lifespans and determining that Agatha died younger than Xiao Yaochang
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    4943c061-6eee-41b5-b433-f6d22a996b3b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that the dates are different
        (1080 vs 561) and concludes NO because Agatha lived longer, not because they
        died at the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Agatha did not die younger than Xiao Yaochang. This
        is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4cf0b6d6-c8c0-4ad3-89ec-c6ab721ba559:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference, noting that "Agatha
        died significantly *after* Xiao Yaochang." The NO was based on this temporal
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final comparative conclusion after analyzing the
        dates.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7414e032-ecd9-4575-9ed8-39ed3fe17176:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not applicable
        when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis comparing the lifespans of the two historical figures.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    8046e072-8017-43d9-a02b-0931a50246db:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Xiao Yaochang died "significantly
        younger" (14 years) than Agatha (approximately 50 years). The NO was based
        on this difference in ages, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the ages at death (14 vs ~50 years), clearly indicating that Xiao Yaochang
        did not die at an older age than Agatha.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d272d39a-b884-42bc-b9f4-c3343ab9a33a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference in time periods ("centuries
        before") and based its NO answer on this difference, determining that Agatha
        lived longer than Xiao Yaochang.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the death dates of both historical figures.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    0b90bf8e-fd51-487d-9c69-eafc063ab324:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the lifespans were very close (48 vs 49 years),
        they were not stated to be equal/identical/the same. The model explicitly
        calculated different values and used this slight difference as the basis for
        its NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the ages at death, indicating Li Qiong did not die younger than Aaron ben
        Gershon (in fact, the model's calculation showed Li Qiong lived 48 years vs
        Aaron's 49 years)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (40 years
        vs 46 years)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after determining
        that Aaron ben Gershon died younger than Li Qiong (40 years vs 46 years)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly compared 1330 to 1130 and found them different,
        with one being later than the other. The NO appears to be in response to the
        implied question about who died first.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the dates, making this a clear NO response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Gersonides died
        later (1344) than Li Qiong (1130), showing a clear difference in values. The
        NO was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that Gersonides did not die younger
        than Li Qiong.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model clearly indicated
        different lifespans (40 vs 61 years)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after determining
        that Aaron ben Gershon died younger than Li Qiong (having lived 40 years compared
        to Li Qiong's 61 years)
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Aaron lived longer
        than Li Qiong, indicating a difference in their lifespans. The NO appears
        to be in response to whether Aaron died younger (with the model indicating

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Aaron lived longer than Li Qiong, making this a clear
        comparative NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model clearly indicated
        different lifespans (41 vs 61 years)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after determining
        that Aaron ben Gershon died younger than Li Qiong (41 years vs 61 years)

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal - it actually identified different death dates (1330 vs 1130) and used
        this difference to reach its conclusion
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the death dates of both individuals (1330

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the death dates are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states that "1598 is later than 839" and uses
        this difference to conclude that Abdullah Khan II lived longer. The NO answer
        appears to be in response to a question about who died younger, not because
        the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the two historical figures, making this a clear NO response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was a difference
        (1598 vs 839) and concludes NO because Abdullah Khan II died older, not because
        they died at the same age or time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final comparative conclusion, based on its reasoning that Abdullah Khan
        II died older than Pei Can.

    1f0f170b-023d-4719-ba2e-ac46ee82dc8f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states that Abdullah Khan II lived
        longer (64-65 years) than Pei Can (45 years), showing a clear difference in
        values. The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        supported by the explicit statement "No, Abdullah Khan II lived longer than
        Pei Can." This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that the dates are different (1598 AD vs 500 AD) and
        concludes NO because Abdullah Khan II lived longer. The values being compared
        are clearly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, based on its reasoning that Abdullah Khan II lived longer than Pei
        Can.

        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not applicable
        when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Abdullah
        Khan II died younger than Pei Can" after comparing their lifespans (64-65
        vs over 80 years)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the ages were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly states that one died later than the other (1598 vs 839)
        and concludes that "Abdullah Khan II lived longer". The NO answer was based
        on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer to whether Abdullah Khan II died younger than Pei Can, providing clear
        dates and reasoning.

    d78cf582-93fe-4565-9249-1a8fe5653552:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the ages at death were
        equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it determined Abdullah Khan II lived
        longer (based on comparing death dates, which is actually faulty logic but
        that's not relevant for our analysis). Since the NO is based on a perceived
        difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer to whether Abdullah Khan II died younger than Pei Can. The answer is
        clear and direct.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different death dates
        (1164 vs 1161) and explains that NO is because Adalbert died AFTER/OLDER than
        Wanyan Jie, not because the dates were equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it identified different death dates (1164 vs 1161) and used
        this difference in its reasoning. The NO appears to be rejecting the conclusion
        about dying "older" rather than indicating equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the death dates of both individuals.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        death dates (911 AD vs 902 AD) and concluding that since Abdullah died later,
        he did not die younger. The NO is not due to equal values, but rather due
        to finding a difference that contradicts the premise.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal. Instead, it noted that 971 CE is earlier than 1989 CE, indicating
        a clear difference in values. The NO answer appears to be based on the logical
        conclusion about age at death, not because of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the final answer, but not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference in dates
        (971 CE vs 1989 CE) and used this difference to reach its conclusion. The
        values being compared were clearly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it does not
        state that the dates are equal - in fact, it shows different values (560 AD
        vs 464 AD). The NO appears to be because 560 AD is not younger than 464 AD,
        not because the dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step analysis
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer. The model
        directly answers whether 560 AD is younger than 464 AD with "No" and reinforces
        this with "Therefore, the answer is NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly stated different values for their
        lifespans (75 years vs 57 years) and indicated that Xie Zhan died younger.
        The NO answer was not due to equal values, but rather because Xie Zhan had
        a shorter lifespan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the lifespans and determining that Xie Zhan died younger than Abraham of Clermont.
        This is a clear comparative answer.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Abraham lived longer
        (75 years vs 69 years), which was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Abraham lived longer (75 years) than Xie Zhan (69 years). This is a clear
        comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model does provide specific lifespans (75
        years vs 67 years), it explicitly states they are different and uses this
        difference to conclude that Xie Zhan died younger. The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the lifespans and determining that Xie Zhan died younger than
        Abraham of Clermont.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on equal values/ages.
        Instead, it reasoned that since Abraham lived after Xie Zhan, it would be
        impossible for Abraham to have died younger. The answer was based on temporal
        sequence, not equal ages.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that Abraham of Clermont did not die younger
        than Xie Zhan.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Abraham lived longer
        (75 years) than Xie Zhan (29 years), showing a clear difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different lifespans (75
        years vs 39 years) and the NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
        The model indicates Abraham lived longer, not that they had equal lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Abraham of Clermont
        did *not* die younger than Xie Zhan." This is a clear NO answer to a comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model indicates that one date is unknown (Son Geon's
        death date) rather than stating the dates are equal. The NO appears to be
        due to inability to make the comparison rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative conclusion rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or verify. While the model notes uncertainty
        about one date, it still provides a clear NO answer to the comparison.

        "1659 is much later than 260-280 AD" and that "Songeon died much earlier."
        The model clearly identified a difference in timing rather than equality as
        the basis for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, where it determined that
        Songeon died much earlier than Abel Servien.

        between the dates ("1659 AD is much later than 300 AD") and this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer. The values are not equal or same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after comparing the dates and finding that 1659 AD is much later than
        300 AD.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - rather, it explains that since Songeon is fictional and "never died," he
        cannot be compared to Servien's real death. This is a logical/existential
        reason rather than an equality-based reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the death ages. While it explains that one subject is fictional,
        it provides this clear comparative answer rather than refusing or indicating
        it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the response wasn't
        about equal values - it was about the inability to compare due to one subject
        being mythological.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but also indicates that one of the subjects (Son Geon) is a mythological figure
        without a death date, making the comparison impossible. This rejection of
        the premise means the answer should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't determine
        one person's lifespan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" because it cannot determine the lifespan of one of the individuals being

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we cannot definitively say yes)"
        and explicitly indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing dates
        for one person. This is a case where the model is expressing inability to
        determine the comparison, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO

        the values were equal - it stated one value was known (1186) and the other
        was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but immediately clarifies
        in parentheses "(We cannot confirm the statement.)" This indicates the model
        is actually stating it cannot determine the comparison, rather than making
        a definitive comparative statement. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (death dates)
        are equal. In fact, it suggests that Seol Se-woong likely lived after Aaron
        of Lincoln, indicating a difference in timing. The NO answer appears to be
        based on this presumed difference in chronology, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it expresses uncertainty about one person's dates, it still provides
        a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to compare or indicating it cannot
        determine.

        False according to the criteria. The values being compared (664 vs 1919) were
        not equal anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the death dates of the two individuals.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the death dates were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference
        between the dates (1864 vs 1455), stating that "1864 is later than 1455."
        The NO answer was given because one date was later than the other, not because
        the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that Jean Flandrin did not die at an
        earlier age than Richard Turstin. The model provided dates and explained that
        1864 is later than 1455 to support this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    0d65cada-a173-4503-b25b-fd9cb8996728:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 1864 is later than
        1253 and used this difference to conclude that Flandrin lived longer, therefore
        did not die younger than Turstin.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that Jean Flandrin did not die
        younger than Richard Turstin.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the ages were equal. The model explicitly calculated different ages (55 vs
        46 years) and stated that Flandrin died older than Turstin, not that they
        died at the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear explanation that Jean Flandrin died
        older (not younger) than Richard Turstin.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Flandrin died "later" than
        Turstin, showing different death dates (1864 vs 1066) as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after determining that Flandrin died later (1864) than Turstin (1066),
        not earlier as the question asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that 1864 is later than
        1356 and shows the dates are different, not equal. The NO answer is based
        on this difference in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates, making this a definitive NO response to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Cannot be determined" and then
        adds "(Essentially, NO, because we cannot confirm YES.)" This indicates inability
        to make the comparison due to missing historical data about one of the subjects.

      result: UNKNOWN
    d403774b-5cc8-4994-ac5b-3db0bf723942:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model didn't give a NO answer
        based on equal values - it actually indicated it couldn't make the comparison
        due to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, I cannot definitively answer
        the question" which indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing
        information about one person's lifespan. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        as it's explicitly stating inability to determine the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't determine one person's
        lifespan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" because it cannot determine one person's lifespan. This indicates an inability
        to make the comparison rather than a refusal to answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the ages are equal - in fact,
        it explicitly states that Geldemar's estimated death age (around 57) is older
        than Shi Xie's death age of 47. The NO answer is given because Geldemar lived
        longer, not because they had equal lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Geldemar died younger than Shi Xie, providing a direct comparative
        conclusion.

        and concluded NO based on comparing their lifespans, stating that Carpenel
        lived longer than Chai Xiang.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

        Carpenel."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the lifespans of both individuals, where
        it determined that Shi Xie died at age 26 while Geldemar Carpenel died at
        approximately age 31.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the death dates were equal. The model explicitly states that 692 AD is later
        than 273 AD and uses this difference to conclude that Ibn al-Zubayr lived
        longer. The NO answer was based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, based on its reasoning that Ibn al-Zubayr lived longer than Zheng
        Zhuo. The answer is clear and direct.

        the values being compared were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 692
        AD is later than 274 AD and uses this difference to conclude that ibn al-Zubayr
        lived longer, therefore did not die younger.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step reasoning
        process and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its comparative answer, indicating
        that ibn al-Zubayr did not die younger than Zheng Zhuo.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly calculated different ages (68 vs 52 years) and stated
        "Ibn al-Zubayr died older than Zheng Zhuo". The NO answer appears to contradict
        the comparison, but we're instructed not to resolve contradictions and simply
        evaluate if equality was given as the reason for NO - which it wasn't.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the ages at death, where it found Ibn al-Zubayr died at 68 and Zheng Zhuo
        at 52. This is a clear comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 692
        AD is later than 264 AD and used this difference to conclude that Abd Allah
        ibn al-Zubayr lived longer, not that they died at the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, following a logical analysis of death dates that
        led to the conclusion that Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr did not die younger than
        Zheng Zhuo.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (68 years
        vs 78 years) and indicates that Ibn al-Zubayr's age was less than Zheng Zhuo's
        age (68 < 78). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly shows its reasoning steps and concludes
        with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values were equal. In fact, it explicitly calculated different ages
        (68 vs 52) and stated that one person died older than the other. The NO was
        not given because the values were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the ages and showing that Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr (68) died older than Zheng
        Zhuo (52). This appears to be a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        was not given because the values were the same - in fact, the model showed
        they were different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the ages, where it found Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr (68) > Zheng

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was a difference
        (692 AD vs 273 AD) and gives the reason for NO as Ibn al-Zubayr living longer,
        not because of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides this as a direct comparative result based on its reasoning that
        Ibn al-Zubayr lived longer.

        not state that the ages were equal. In fact, it explicitly calculated different
        ages (68 vs 50 years) and stated that "68 (Ibn al-Zubayr) > 50 (Zheng Zhuo)".
        The NO answer was not explained as being due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, which
        contradicts its previous statement that "Ibn al-Zubayr died older than Zheng
        Zhuo." Despite this contradiction, we must take the final explicit "NO" as
        the model's answer since we're instructed to analyze only what was explicitly
        stated and not resolve contradictions.

        - in fact, it explicitly noted that "Xiao Huan died at a younger age than
        Abra" and gave different death dates (565 AD vs 553 AD). The NO answer appears
        to be based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Abra died later (560 CE vs
        494 CE) and concluded that "Abra likely died *older* than Xiao Huan." The
        NO appears to be in response to some unstated comparison, but regardless,
        equality was not given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give equality as the reason for
        its NO answer. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes Abra likely lived
        longer than Xiao Huan's 8 years, indicating a difference in their ages at
        death. The model explicitly states "she likely lived longer than 8 years"
        as its reasoning.

        in fact, it explicitly states "1627 (Khan-I-Khana's death) is much later than
        537 (Gao Bin's death)" showing a clear difference in values. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after comparing the death dates of 1627 and 537, providing an explicit
        NO answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5fdb5227-8227-4d00-b64f-2a7e3b0dbc90:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in ages (71 vs 44) and uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion. It
        does not state the values are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the ages (71 vs 44)

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly stated different values for their
        lifespans (71 years vs 61 years) and indicated Gao Bin died younger. The NO
        answer was not due to equal values but due to the comparison showing a difference
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the lifespans and determining that Gao Bin died younger

    64ab6715-199b-4006-9680-2cdc3c0ff30f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 1627 is later than 555 and used
        this difference to conclude that Khan-I-Khana lived longer, therefore did
        not die younger.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that Abdul Rahim Khan-I-Khana
        did not die younger.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly calculated different values (71
        years vs 45 years) and stated "71 > 45". The NO answer was not based on equal
        values, but rather on a clear difference between the lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the ages of the two historical figures, making this a clear
        negative comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bcefe885-e78b-4e07-a335-ed937be17c0a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly calculated different lifespans (71 years vs 29 years)
        and stated that "71 years is greater than 29 years." The NO answer appears
        to contradict the model's own reasoning, but we're not meant to resolve such
        contradictions. Since the model clearly showed different values rather than
        equal ones, this cannot be classified as a NO due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but this
        appears to contradict its own reasoning where it concludes "Abdul Rahim Khan-I-Khana
        lived longer than Gao Bin." Due to this internal contradiction, and since
        we're instructed to classify based on the explicit final statement rather
        than resolve contradictions, the final answer is NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    deeb5b58-95ee-40c1-8e8d-e63469397246:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly calculated different ages (71
        and 30 years) and showed that one was greater than the other (71 > 30). The
        NO answer was given because Abdul Rahim lived longer, not because they had
        equal lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result showing that Abdul Rahim Khan-I-Khana
        did NOT die younger than Gao Bin. The answer is definitive and matches the
        step-by-step calculation showing 71 > 30.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the values were equal - it stated that one value doesn't exist because
        the character is fictional.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes that since one character is fictional,
        no real comparison can be made. While it states "NO" at the end, this is effectively
        rejecting the premises of the question since one subject is fictional. Per
        the instructions, when a model rejects the premises, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), we must answer False to this question. Additionally, even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model did not cite equality of values as the reason
        - it instead cited the impossibility of comparison due to one subject being
        fictional.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but immediately explains that the comparison is "nonsensical" because one
        subject is fictional and has no death date. This effectively rejects the premises
        of the question, making it impossible to determine. When a model rejects the
        premises or indicates it cannot make the comparison, we should classify it
        as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but rejects the premise by explaining
        that Song Niang is fictional and therefore cannot have a real death date to

        nature of one subject and implies the comparison can be made with the fictional
        narrative, but doesn't indicate equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives an explicit "NO" as its final answer.
        While it discusses that one subject is fictional, it still provides a clear

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly noted that the dates were different (1381 vs 1257)
        and used this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer was based
        on the fact that one date was later than the other, not because the values
        were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, without any caveats about uncertainty or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: "While the final answer was NO, it was not because\
        \ the values being compared were equal. The model explicitly noted that 1767\
        \ is later than 1718 and used this difference to conclude that \xDAjezd lived\
        \ longer, not that they died at the same age."
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly concluded with \"NO\" as its\

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that the death dates are different (1610 vs 923) and
        concludes NO because Elsheimer died later, not because of any equality between
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the death dates and concluding that Elsheimer
        did not die younger.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that the dates are different (1610 vs 552) and says
        "1610 is much later than 552." The NO is because Elsheimer died later, not
        because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the death dates, indicating that Elsheimer did
        not die younger than Xiao Yaoguang.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its

      explanation_equal_values: While the ages are close (32 vs 31), the model explicitly
        states there is a difference and that Elsheimer died "older than" Xiao Yaoguang.
        The NO answer was given because of this difference, not because the values
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Elsheimer died at age 32, which was older (not younger)
        than Xiao Yaoguang who died at age 31.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states that 1610 is later than 552
        and uses this difference to conclude that Elsheimer did not die younger. The
        values are clearly different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the death dates of the two individuals. This
        is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly stated different ages (34 vs
        27) and gave the reason for NO as Elsheimer dying older than Xiao Yaoguang,
        not because they were equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that Elsheimer did not die younger (since
        it found he died older)

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference, stating "1610 AD is
        later than 493 AD." The NO answer appears to be based on this difference in
        dates, not on any equality between values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the death dates of both individuals. This
        is a clear NO answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        death dates (1610 AD vs 552 AD) and determining that one is later than the
        other. It does not state the values are equal or use equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative reasoning that Elsheimer died later, therefore
        did not die younger.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1610
        is later than 426 and uses this difference to conclude that Elsheimer lived
        longer, not that they died at the same age.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I cannot definitively
        say yes)" but this is actually expressing an inability to make the comparison
        due to missing information about Zhao Fen. The model explicitly states "we
        cannot compare" the lifespans. This is a case where the model is indicating
        it cannot determine the answer, which should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't determine one
        of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or

        give a NO answer based on equal values - it refused to make any comparison
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and explains this is because it cannot identify a specific Zhao Fen to
        make the comparison. This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.

        all due to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because "the question cannot be definitively answered" due to lack

        NO), this automatically results in False. The model never claimed the values
        were equal - it simply couldn't determine one of the values to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" because it cannot find information about one of the subjects to make the
        comparison. This indicates an inability to determine the answer rather than
        a refusal to compare or a clear YES/NO.

        the values being compared are equal. Instead, the model states it cannot make
        the comparison due to missing information about one person's lifespan. The
        NO is due to inability to verify, not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it explains it cannot make the comparison due to missing information
        about Zhao Fen, the presence of an explicit "NO" answer makes this a NO rather
        than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

        death years (2011 vs 1973) and based its NO answer on Majeed dying later,
        not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with clear reasoning that Majeed did not die younger

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal - it explicitly stated that the values were different (2011 vs 1973)
        and gave a directional reason (Majeed died later than Ma). The NO was based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear logical path leading to that conclusion

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a comparison showing
        different values (2011 vs 1973), not because the values are equal. The model
        explicitly states that Abdul Majeed died "later" than Ma Quanjue.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the death
        years it identified.

    b0bf8d99-c2cc-478f-bab9-d484f4b0ef04:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. The model explicitly states there was
        a difference (2011 vs 1973) and concludes NO because Abdul Majeed died in
        a later year. The NO is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the death years and concluding that Abdul Majeed
        did not die younger than Ma Quanjue.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a comparison showing
        different values (2011 vs 1993), not because the values are equal. It specifically
        states that Abdul Majeed died "later" than Ma Quanjue.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the death

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (84 vs 98)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, A. L. Abdul
        Majeed died younger than Ma Quanjue" after calculating and comparing their
        ages at death (84 vs 98)
      final_answer: 'YES'

    ece93b14-4dab-4e7a-8a62-4d7d63bd0464:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted that Majeed died in 1988 while Ma
        died in 1973, and concluded NO because Majeed died later (i.e., the values
        were different).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear logical path leading to that conclusion
        based on comparing death years.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f553b667-b7ee-44a1-9a9b-c4d57df18ab3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it gave NO because it determined Majeed died later (2011
        vs 1973) and therefore could not have died younger than Ma. The values being
        compared were different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning about who died younger.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 1667 is later than 1072/1062,
        indicating a difference in values. The NO was because Cowley died in a later
        year, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that Cowley did not die younger
        than Qian Ge Fei.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the death dates were equal. The model explicitly states that 1667 is later
        than 1104 and uses this difference to conclude that Cowley lived longer. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (concluding
        that Cowley did not die younger than Qian Gefei).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not applicable
        when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the lifespans and finding that 48-49 years is younger than 54-55 years.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    523149ea-3f15-467c-ac89-fd0b331af5d8:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" at the end of its step-by-step analysis.

    65aa3935-1e2b-4fc4-a972-0233909511e1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (death dates)
        are equal - in fact, it explicitly notes that Cowley died *after* Qian Ge
        Fei, indicating different dates (1667 vs 1051). The NO answer is based on
        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the death dates of the two figures.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    80fb2f51-ecad-4018-89bf-1b33becf2620:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1667 is later than
        1051 and uses this difference to conclude that Cowley lived longer, making
        this the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step reasoning
        process and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its comparative answer, indicating
        that Cowley did not die younger than Qian Gefei.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Cowley lived longer and died older
        than Qian Gefei, indicating a difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after reasoning
        about the death dates, providing a clear comparative answer to whether Cowley
        died younger than Qian Gefei.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    da4175cb-c8e0-4821-99f4-e5cce22174ab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        values were equal - it actually noted that the dates were different (1085
        vs 1667) but couldn't make the comparison due to missing birth date information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because it "cannot definitively say YES" due to missing
        information. This indicates uncertainty rather than a comparative result,
        making this effectively "cannot determine" - an UNKNOWN response.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    e1b98d7e-4950-4ad8-8041-f4374622a31e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the ages at death were
        equal. Instead, it based its NO answer on the fact that Cowley died at a later
        date (1667 vs 1061), incorrectly assuming this meant he lived longer. The
        model never compared their actual ages or claimed they died at the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" to the question
        of whether Cowley died younger than Qian Gefei. This was a clear comparative
        answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e5a6d340-e71d-47f3-8fa0-12a40dd0cb27:

        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (48 vs 58)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Abraham
        Cowley died younger than Qian Gefei" after comparing their lifespans (48 <
        58)

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values being compared (628
        BC vs 1656 AD) were not equal anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final

    0d92691b-ae72-4f55-8497-a1b9207b220e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lifespans are equal.
        In fact, it indicates uncertainty about Zheng Mu's total lifespan, noting
        that it was "significantly longer than 26 years." The NO answer appears to
        be based on this uncertainty rather than any equality between the lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in step 4. While the model expresses uncertainty about Zheng Mu's exact
        lifespan, it still provides a definitive NO answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any discussion of values in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO" and explains that due to uncertainty around Zheng Mu's full lifespan,
        it cannot make a definitive comparison. This is a clear case where the model
        indicates it cannot determine the answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    74e9230a-ca6a-48eb-ac5d-c29c9bcfe59f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        values were equal. Rather, the NO was given because one value was definite
        (25 years) while the other was a minimum (at least 21 years), making a definitive
        comparison impossible. The model explicitly states that Zheng Mu could have
        lived "much longer than 21 years."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result based on the analysis that
        Millauer's 25 years cannot be definitively shown to be younger than Zheng
        Mu's minimum of 21 years.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Abraham Millauer lived longer (27
        years) compared to Zheng Mu (estimated at "a year or two"). The NO answer
        was based on a clear difference in lifespans, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the lifespans, making a clear comparative judgment that Abraham Millauer lived
        longer than Zheng Mu.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Millauer lived longer
        than Zheng Mu (63 years vs 29 years), showing a clear difference in values.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference ("1966 is much
        later than 1254" and "Arcioni lived much longer"), making this a clear case
        where the NO was based on a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after comparing the death dates of the two individuals.

    4a3aedab-770a-46ff-8309-378f64bc35a2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        that "1966 is much later than 1254" - indicating a clear difference between
        the values rather than equality. The NO is based on this difference, not on
        the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer. The answer
        is definitive and not qualified with uncertainty.

    561f1aac-eb83-431e-bd40-e52a66ef7aa8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it gave NO because it found that Arcioni died later (1411)
        than William III de Cantilupe (1254), explicitly stating "Since Arcioni died
        later, he could not have died younger."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after reasoning through the death dates.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    7cb098e7-2c2b-4361-bbb3-ad87eae6b7d8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal - it actually found different dates (1411 vs 1254) and noted that one
        was later than the other. The NO appears to contradict the model's own reasoning
        about Arcioni living longer, but we must evaluate only what was explicitly
        stated without trying to resolve this contradiction.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the death dates.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it compared two different dates (1966 and
        1254) and determined that one was later than the other. The model actually
        seems to have contradicted itself by saying "Arcioni lived longer" but then
        concluding "NO", but we must analyze only what was explicitly stated without
        resolving contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the death dates.

    954281bd-e11a-48aa-ba5c-4f5abefa11e7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1411 is later than
        1254 and uses this difference to conclude NO. The values are clearly different,
        not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear reasoning process leading to that conclusion
        based on the dates comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ac01bf59-d037-495a-9ab8-0a1d7f9bb4c9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal. In fact, it explicitly noted a difference, stating "1966 is later
        than 1308". Even though the reasoning seems contradictory, we must evaluate
        based solely on what was stated. The NO answer was not justified by claiming
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis. While the reasoning seems
        inconsistent (finding that Arcioni lived later but concluding NO), we must
        take the explicit final "NO" at face value per instructions.

    ad7f036b-2fa7-466c-8cb3-28c43fedad62:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly noted that 1966 is later than 1254 and showed they
        were different dates. The NO answer appears to contradict its own reasoning
        (which suggested Arcioni lived later), but we must evaluate only what was
        explicitly stated without resolving contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis.

    fe4dbfcf-5dc8-4095-b67f-693468306888:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it identified different dates (1411 vs 1254) and used this
        difference in its reasoning. The NO appears to be rejecting the comparison
        since it states "Arcioni lived longer" which seems to contradict the final
        NO, but we're instructed not to resolve contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the ages were equal - in fact,
        it explicitly stated that Louis I "lived longer" than Nestor. The NO answer
        was based on this difference in ages, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether Louis I died younger than Nestor, after analyzing
        their death dates.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted that 1457 is "much later than 306"
        and gave the difference in dates as the reason for its answer. The values
        were clearly stated to be different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the dates, making this a clear NO response.

    38e48769-ea2e-433f-9bac-b2b9deb6f96b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it compared two different dates (1557 and 306) and found them
        to be different. The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning,
        but we're instructed to focus only on whether equality was cited as the reason
        for NO, which it wasn't.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the dates, making a clear comparative statement. While the reasoning appears
        flawed (comparing death dates doesn't determine who lived longer), the model
        gave a definitive NO answer.

      result: 'NO'
    3f678f2f-5cff-41db-a832-e6a9e080c7eb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on equal values
        - instead, it explicitly noted that the dates were different (360 AD vs 1557
        AD) and used this difference to conclude that Louis did not die younger. The
        NO was based on a comparison showing different values, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear reasoning process leading to that conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it actually indicates that the deaths occurred at very different times (305
        AD vs 1557 AD) and concludes that Nestor died earlier. The NO is based on
        the comparative conclusion that Louis did not die younger than Nestor, not
        because of any equality between values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in Step 4, providing a clear negative response to whether Louis I died
        younger than Nestor.

    9724c2bf-22ea-49e1-abe5-f9b2b8babb8d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the death dates were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly stated there were "centuries" between their deaths,
        with Louis I dying later. The NO answer was based on this difference in timing,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Louis I died later than Nestor, providing a clear comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determined
        Louis lived longer than Nestor (died 1557 vs 306 AD), not because the values
        were equal. In fact, it explicitly states there was a difference ("306 AD
        is much earlier than 1557").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, both in its reasoning and as a standalone answer
        at the end. This NO is given as a direct comparative result, not as an inability
        to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal - in fact, it explicitly stated there was a large difference between
        the dates (1557 AD vs 303-313 AD), describing them as "much later." The NO
        appears to be a direct response to the original comparative question rather
        than indicating equality.

    ece8293d-8f06-4cc8-9f9b-37c23425f0fa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Rather, it explicitly states that one date (305 AD)
        is "much earlier" than the other (1557), and uses this difference to conclude
        that Louis died later. The model never suggests the dates or ages are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, both in its step 4 and as a bold conclusion. The
        NO is given as a direct comparative result, not as an inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted differences, stating that 1557 AD
        is later than 305 AD and that Nestor lived a shorter life. The NO answer appears
        to be based on these differences rather than any equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Abbas Mirza died later
        than Yang Kan, showing different death dates (1833 vs 566).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly noted
        different values (85 years vs 73 years) rather than stating they were equal.
        The NO appears to be based on these different values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the lifespans of 85 years vs 73

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed different lifespans (76
        years vs 54 years) and stated that Huang Fei died younger than Cardoso. The
        NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the lifespans of the two individuals, with clear reasoning
        showing Huang Fei died younger (54 years) than Cardoso (76 years).

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference, stating "1930 (Cardoso)
        is much later than 1408 (Taejo)" and concluded Cardoso lived longer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the death dates of the two individuals. This was a clear comparative answer,
        not a refusal or inability to determine.

        about when they lived, suggesting Abraham I lived and died later than Shi
        Le. Since the NO wasn't based on equal values, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without indicating inability to determine or rejecting
        premises. While the reasoning shows some uncertainty ("highly probable"),
        the model still provided a clear NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it gave NO because one person (Adam Brendel) is still alive
        while the other (Hosokawa Naotoshi) died in 1352. The model explicitly states
        "Since Adam Brendel is still alive, he has not died at a younger age than
        Hosokawa Naotoshi." This is a difference-based reason, not an equality-based
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model calculated specific lifespans (68
        vs 72 years), it did not state that the values were equal. In fact, it noted
        a difference in the lifespans, with Naotoshi living longer. The NO answer
        was given because the comparison statement was false (Brendel living fewer
        years), not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the lifespans, making a clear comparative statement that Brendel did not live

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared are equal. Rather, the NO was given because Adam
        Brendel is still alive and therefore cannot have died younger than Hosokawa
        Naotoshi. The model does not state or imply that their ages or lifespans are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on the fact that Adam Brendel
        is still alive and thus cannot have died younger than Hosokawa Naotoshi.

        different lifespans (68 years vs 33 years) and stated that "Adam Brendel lived
        longer than Hosokawa Naotoshi." The NO was not due to equal values, but rather
        indicated a clear difference in lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Adam Brendel lived longer than Hosokawa Naotoshi, making this a clear

        (81 years vs 68 years) and states that Aaron's lifespan was greater than Zheng
        Yan's. The NO answer was given because of this difference in values, not because
        the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Aaron Halle-Wolfssohn did

        this difference to reach its conclusion. The values being compared (81 and
        72) are clearly different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step analysis
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer to whether

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the lifespans were equal. Rather, the model's reasoning was based on the historical
        timing (7th century vs 6th century) and concluded that Abdullah ibn Hasan
        could not have died younger than Xiao Daxin. The model did not state or imply
        that their lifespans were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Abdullah ibn Hasan did not die younger
        than Xiao Daxin.

        it explicitly compares them, suggesting Gao Yongchang was likely older than
        Abd al-Malik I's 58-59 years. The NO answer is based on this comparative difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after reasoning
        that it's "highly unlikely" Gao Yongchang died younger than Abd al-Malik I.

        - it explicitly states that the death dates are different (705 AD vs 621 AD)
        and bases its NO answer on the fact that Abd al-Malik I died later, not on
        any equality between values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        death dates were equal. The model explicitly states that Abd al-Malik I died
        *after* Gao Yongchang (between 685-705 AD vs 684 AD), and uses this temporal
        difference as the reason for its NO answer, not because their death dates
        were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Abd al-Malik I died younger than Gao Yongchang. This
        is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the death dates and determining that Abd al-Malik I died earlier than Gao
        Yongchang.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference, stating "Deng Fang died
        significantly earlier than Aba of Kashgar." The NO answer appears to be based
        on this temporal difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its final comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    0f90b053-1e0a-47f8-8289-b8af5457a048:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the two people
        having equal death ages. Rather, it's based on the temporal impossibility
        of Aba dying younger given that he lived in a later century than Deng Fang.
        The model explicitly states there is a difference in when they lived (8th
        vs 9th century).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        that Aba of Kashkar could not have died younger than Deng Fang since Deng
        Fang lived in an earlier century.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    14e78096-fa68-4187-af10-fdc03a3e3906:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model did not
        cite equality as a reason - it cited inability to compare due to lack of information
        about one subject.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot answer the question
        definitively)" which indicates it cannot make the determination. This is effectively
        stating an inability to compare, making it an UNKNOWN response rather than
        a definitive NO comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. The model never claimed the values were
        equal - it stated it couldn't find the necessary information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer the question. Therefore, I cannot say YES or NO." This indicates it
        cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    46f342ca-b260-44e3-9fb8-fc12730d761a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal/same/identical. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating
        that Deungbang appears to have lived before Aba of Kashkar. The NO answer
        is based on this temporal difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct answer to the comparison rather than
        a statement about inability to determine or rejection of premises.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model never reached a point
        of comparing equal values since it couldn't identify one of the subjects.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"I cannot answer YES\
        \ or NO\" because it cannot identify one of the subjects (\uB4F1\uBC29) and\
        \ therefore cannot make the comparison. This is a case where the model indicates\

        were equal - it stated it couldn't find information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information
        about one figure's lifespan. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot determine the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't determine
        the values in the first place.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer the question"
        due to insufficient information about one of the subjects. This is a clear
        case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing
        data.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer due to equal values - it gave a response indicating
        inability to determine the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model states \"NO, we cannot determine if Aba\
        \ of Kashkar died younger than \uB4F1\uBC29\" - this is explicitly stating\
        \ an inability to make the comparison, not a comparative result. This falls\

    f2abb175-f54c-4f65-825e-f5528c998898:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the two figures had equal
        lifespans or ages at death. Instead, it gave a different reason for the NO
        answer - that since Aba lived after Emperor Taizu, it would be impossible
        for him to have died younger. This is a logical/temporal argument rather than
        an equality comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to whether Aba of Kashkar died younger than Emperor Taizu. The model
        provided reasoning leading to this conclusion based on their different time
        periods.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Abd ar-Rahman IV died older (35
        years) than Gao Miaoyi (29 years). The NO answer was based on this difference
        in ages, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Abd ar-Rahman IV died at age 35, which was older than Gao Miaoyi who
        died around age 29. This is a clear comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        False according to the classification criteria. The equal values criteria
        only need to be evaluated for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the two historical figures' death dates, making this a clear YES answer.

        False according to the criteria. The values being compared (their ages at
        death) were not stated to be equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after explaining
        that Abd ar-Rahman IV died before Gao Miaoyi was born and therefore died younger
        than her.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The model did not claim the values were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly noted a temporal difference with one person dying
        before the other was born.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after laying
        out its reasoning comparing the death dates of the two historical figures.

    ceaa5488-2dc7-42b2-a7d6-1edac641abea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it stated that since Abd ar-Rahman IV lived centuries
        after Gao Miaoyi, he could not have died younger than her. The reasoning was
        based on a logical impossibility due to their different time periods, not
        because their ages at death were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" as its final answer regarding
        whether Abd ar-Rahman IV died younger than Gao Miaoyi. The answer was presented
        as a direct comparative conclusion.

        equal - in fact, it explicitly notes different death dates (1360/1370 vs 1257)
        and states that Xianyu Shirong died earlier. The NO answer is based on a comparison
        showing difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in step 5, with a clear directional conclusion that Xianyu Shirong

        years) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after determining

        equal. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on the temporal sequence of when
        they lived, concluding that Aaron ben Zerah lived later and thus could not
        have died younger. The response doesn't mention equality of ages as a reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, based on its reasoning that Aaron ben Zerah lived after

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated that Xianyu Shirong died
        in 1260 while Aaron ben Zerah died sometime in the 1300s, and used this difference
        in timing as the basis for its answer. The model did not claim the death dates
        were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after reasoning about the death dates, indicating that

    c06b59bb-eab7-4bbf-9e11-5f1bc97e84e5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 1426 is later than 717 and
        used this difference to conclude that John IV lived longer. The values being
        compared (death dates) were different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that John IV did not die younger than Grimoald
        III. This is a clear NO answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 1426 is later than 730 and used
        this difference to conclude that John IV did not die younger than Grimoald
        III. The NO was based on a clear difference in dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, following a logical step-by-step analysis
        that led to this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d90f6141-2d2f-4479-9ac0-e2fe9abec047:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it gave NO because it found different dates (717 vs 1426)
        and determined that since John IV died later, he must have lived longer, not
        younger.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after walking through its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    dcb199a9-2025-4a07-9059-455d9ea49b13:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different ages at death
        (25 vs 12 years) and indicates Grimoald III died younger.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the ages at death (25 vs 12 years) and determining that Grimoald
        III died younger.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e188905b-db88-4da1-9ab5-189e29532d90:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. The model explicitly states there was
        a difference (1426 vs 717) and concludes NO because John IV died older, not
        because they died at the same age or time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with clear reasoning based on comparing death dates (1426 vs 717)
        and concluding that John IV died older, not younger, than Grimoald III.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e31bb394-ee85-47c4-b541-878030e21402:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly noted that 1426 is later than 739. The NO answer appears
        to contradict its own reasoning, but we must evaluate based on what was stated,
        not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    240369a4-3cc8-497c-83fd-7e3f2ac7a9ba:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        between the dates ("1981 is much later than 1418") and this difference, not
        equality, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after comparing the death dates and finding that 1981 is much later than
        1418.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3748c9d6-e9c4-4517-bbd2-7e090a210c2f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        did not cite equality as a reason - it rejected the premise of comparing a
        death date to something that cannot die.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of comparing a person's
        death date to a town (which cannot die). When a model rejects the premises
        or indicates a comparison is impossible/illogical, we should classify as UNKNOWN
        rather than NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    525fe939-e84a-4750-829f-008da424b90f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated that one entity doesn't have a comparable
        lifespan at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of comparing lifespans
        since one entity (Jinbu) is a town that doesn't have a lifespan. While it
        states "NO" at the end, this is a case where the model is rejecting the validity
        of the comparison itself rather than making a comparative conclusion, so this
        falls under the UNKNOWN category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    73e6fed5-e139-445d-aec5-bdc27e92fa1c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly noted that "Khan died much later than Taejo" indicating
        a clear difference in death years (1981 vs 1408). The NO answer was not based
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the death dates of the two figures.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    771a1707-c608-444c-b153-76b4f2885240:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        values were equal - it stated the comparison itself was invalid because towns
        don't have lifespans like people do.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of comparing a person's
        lifespan to a town's lifespan, stating it's illogical. While it says "NO"
        at the end, this is a case where the model is rejecting the ability to make
        the comparison rather than making an actual comparative judgment.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    7d4058da-e554-44ed-a27d-16695b7a5ed0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is not relevant
        since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" at the end of its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    80a80749-be7d-4500-bdbe-6050123b7a00:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot answer the question
        definitively)" and explicitly indicates it cannot determine one of the death
        dates. This is a case where the model is expressing inability to make the
        comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    8add5595-29c5-4167-a1d9-b5674f9eb206:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model does not
        state that the values (ages at death) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states
        it cannot know Chen Fu's dates. The NO is not based on equality of values
        but rather on inability to determine the dates. Since equality is not given
        as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a statement
        about inability to determine. However, this conflicts with the model's reasoning
        which indicates it cannot make the comparison due to unknown dates. Following
        the instructions to classify based purely on what was stated without resolving
        contradictions, we must take the explicit "NO" at face value.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b8c6c668-d1b2-4f53-9897-c80b87ee89f5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values were equal.
        Instead, it identified different death dates (1981 vs 1637) and stated that
        Abdul Qayyum Khan lived longer, indicating a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" after comparing the death dates of the two individuals.

    ca265a1a-5826-485a-b033-7df6ff4bb8d4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model's reasoning
        was about incomparability of lifespans between a person and a town, not about
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot make the comparison because one subject
        (Jinbu) is a town that "doesn't have a lifespan." This is effectively rejecting
        the premises of the question, making it impossible to compare the lifespans.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model did not
        claim the ages were equal - it actually claimed one person died younger than
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its step-by-step reasoning about who died younger, indicating Abbo of Fleury
        died younger than Pak Hon-yong.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly noted different values (1004 vs 1942) and used
        these different values to make its determination. The model specifically stated
        "1004 is less than 1942."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing
        the death dates of both individuals. This was a clear comparative answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values (ages at death)
        were equal. Instead, it analyzed their birth and death dates and concluded
        NO, but without explicitly stating they died at the same age. In fact, the
        model's analysis shows different death dates (653 vs 699/700) and different

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference in death dates
        (1680 vs 1665) and gave NO because Abadai died later/lived longer than Huang
        Junhan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear reasoning process leading to that conclusion
        based on comparing death dates.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that Huang Junhan died earlier (between 1664-1666)
        than Abadai Khan (around 1678). The NO answer appears to be based on this
        difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the death dates.

    2dc7f742-0492-41f4-a70d-dc078ab161af:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it refused to answer due to insufficient
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT ANSWER due to
        insufficient information" and explains that "a confident YES or NO answer
        is impossible" due to lack of clear information about one subject's lifespan.
        This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. Instead, it gave NO because it found
        that Abadai died later (1678 vs 1665), explicitly stating "Abadai died *after*
        Huang." The values were different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the death dates and determining that Abadai died
        after Huang, therefore could not have died younger.

    e35f1e62-c4e5-4c60-ac67-74feeda0de18:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The model's reasoning was
        about inability to compare due to one subject being fictional, not about equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the comparison since
        one of the subjects (Huang Junhan) is determined to be fictional and therefore
        cannot have a real lifespan to compare. When a model rejects the premises
        of the question, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted that Abadai died in 1678
        while Huang Junhan died in 1665, and used this difference (Abadai dying later)
        as the reason for its NO answer. The values were different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that Abadai did not die younger than Huang
        Junhan. This is a clear negative comparative response.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the lifespans were equal - it stated one was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot definitively say" due to one subject being mythical
        with unknown dates. This is effectively stating it cannot determine the comparison,
        which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

    80902496-6767-4303-974e-b81cdee6583d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. Rather, the model explained that one
        person's dates are unknown, making comparison impossible. The NO wasn't based
        on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it explains uncertainty about dates, it provides this as a clear
        comparative conclusion rather than indicating it cannot determine the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the values
        were equal - it stated the comparison was impossible because of comparing
        different types of entities (person vs star).
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that a direct comparison is impossible
        because one subject is a person and the other is a star, then concludes with
        "NO". Since the model rejects the premises of the question (comparing a person
        to a star), this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the explicit "NO"
        statement.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the values were equal - it instead stated that a comparison
        was not possible due to one subject being fictional.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of comparing a real
        person to a fictional character, stating "We can't compare the lifespan of
        a real person to a fictional one in a meaningful way." While it ends with
        "NO", this is a case where the model is rejecting the validity of the comparison
        itself rather than making a comparative determination. This falls under the
        UNKNOWN criteria where the model rejects the premises of the question.

        because the character was fictional.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately explains that
        the comparison is impossible because one figure is fictional and the other
        is historical. This is effectively rejecting the premises of the question,
        making it an UNKNOWN rather than a clear comparative NO.

        no Okina (who likely had a shorter lifespan). The NO answer was based on this
        difference in lifespans, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

        is fictional.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that a comparison is impossible because
        one subject is fictional, making this a rejection of the premises. While it
        ends with "NO", this is a case where the model is indicating it cannot make
        the comparison rather than making a comparative conclusion.

        (Kusakabe no Okina's lifespan), making comparison impossible. The NO wasn't
        based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

    13fb5973-f85e-47d4-80e0-fabde503e775:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the lifespans were equal. In fact, it suggested the opposite - that Peng
        Le likely lived longer than Abel. The NO answer appears to stem from lack
        of definitive proof rather than equality of values. Since equality was not
        given as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, though this seems to contradict its reasoning that "it's highly likely
        Peng Le lived longer than Abel." Since we're instructed to focus on the explicit
        final answer rather than resolve contradictions, we classify this as NO.

        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference, noting "1252
        AD is much later than 196 BC" and concluded that "Abel lived much later and
        died long after Peng Le."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        did not make a comparison of equal values - it stated it couldn't make any
        comparison at all due to lack of data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this means it cannot make a determination due to lack of information.
        This is equivalent to saying "NO, I cannot verify" or "NO, I cannot determine"
        which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        model never claimed the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        the values at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot determine" the comparison due to lack of information.
        This makes it a case where the model is indicating inability to make the comparison
        rather than a comparative result, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.

        give a NO answer based on equal values - it refused to make any comparison
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and explains that it cannot make a definitive comparison due to lack of
        reliable dates. This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.

        the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the values at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but in
        the explanation indicates it's "impossible to definitively say who died younger."
        This makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot determine the comparison,
        which should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" at the end.

        a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't establish the values to
        compare.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer the question. Therefore, I cannot say YES or NO." This indicates it
        cannot make the comparison due to lack of information, making this an UNKNOWN
        response rather than a REFUSED response (which would indicate rejection of

      explanation_final_answer: The model ends with "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that it cannot make the determination due to lack of information. This is
        effectively stating "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN
        classification criteria.

        the model never claimed the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        the values at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (It's impossible to determine
        with reasonable certainty.)" - this is explicitly stating it cannot determine
        the comparison, which falls under our UNKNOWN classification criteria. The
        parenthetical clarification shows this is not a comparative NO but rather
        an inability to make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never compared
        actual values or declared them equal - it simply stated it couldn't access
        the necessary information to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer the question" and "I cannot say YES or NO" due to lack of historical
        information. This is a clear indication that the model cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Abdul Kalam
        died younger than Chen Zhensun" after comparing the dates. While the model's
        logic appears flawed (just comparing death dates doesn't determine who died
        younger), it did provide a clear YES answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on comparing different
        years (2015 vs 1249) and concluding that Kalam died later, not because the
        dates were equal. The model explicitly notes a difference ("2015 is obviously
        later than 1249").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 2015 is later than 1249 and
        concluded that Kalam lived longer, indicating a clear difference between the
        death dates rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that A. P. J. Abdul Kalam did

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal - it explicitly stated that the dates were different (2015 vs 1249)
        and gave the reason that Kalam died later and lived longer, not because their
        ages at death were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether Kalam died younger than Chen Zhensun, after

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. The model explicitly noted that 2015
        is later than 1249 and used this difference to conclude that Kalam did not
        die younger than Chen Zhensun. The NO was based on a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the ages at death were
        equal. Instead, it bases its NO answer on comparing death dates (2015 vs Song
        Dynasty), not on any equality of ages at death. The model doesn't actually
        compare their ages at death at all - it only compares when they died chronologically.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer to whether Kalam died younger than Chen Zhensun. This is a clear NO
        answer based on its analysis of death dates.

        a large difference in death dates, with Kalam dying "much later" than Chen
        Zhensun
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the lifespans are close (56 vs 55 years), the
        model explicitly states that "Abba Mari lived slightly longer" and uses this
        difference (not equality) as the basis for its NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the lifespans and determining that Abba Mari lived slightly
        longer than Qian Yuanguan

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 1310 is later than
        941 and uses this difference to conclude that Abba Mari lived longer, not
        that they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates and determining that Abba Mari did not die
        younger than Qian Yuanguan.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "Abba Mari lived
        slightly longer" and calculates different lifespans (56 years vs 54 years).
        The NO answer is not due to equal values, but rather indicates a difference
        in ages.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the lifespans of the two individuals.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in lifespans, noting that "Abba Mari lived slightly longer than Qian Yuan
        Guan" (56 vs 55 years). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (56 vs 65
        years)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Abba Mari
        died younger than Qian Yuanguan" after comparing their lifespans (56 years

        in lifespans ("Abba Mari lived approximately one year longer than Qian Yuanjun")
        and does not claim the values are equal. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the lifespans, indicating that Qian Yuanjun did not die younger
        (since Abba Mari lived approximately one year longer)

        different values (56 years vs 54 years) and did not state they were equal.
        In fact, it showed a 2-year difference between their lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final comparative conclusion after calculating and comparing the
        lifespans (56 years vs 54 years).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False. Additionally, the model found different ages at death (57-58 vs 71),
        not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" to the question
        "Did Abbas I die younger than Lu Shancai?" after calculating that Abbas I
        died at age 57-58 while Lu Shancai died at age 71.

    cea38dbf-deaf-4f7e-afe0-edaa586955ab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Abbas I died AFTER
        Lu Shanzhen (1629 > 1610), showing a clear difference in values. The NO answer
        was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on the death dates
        showing Abbas I died after (not younger than) Lu Shanzhen.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly noted that Ortelius died in 1598 while Song died
        in 1592, and used this difference to conclude that Ortelius died older than
        Song. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Ortelius died later than Song, making this a clear negative comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal. Instead, it gave NO because it reasoned that Song Jingang must
        be younger than Ortelius based on historical context, indicating a difference
        in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, making a clear comparative judgment based on its reasoning about the
        death dates.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the death dates were equal - it stated one death date
        was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but in step 4 indicates it "cannot definitively say whether Ortelius died
        younger" due to missing information about Song Geumgang's death date. Since
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison, this falls under the UNKNOWN
        classification criteria.

        they lived at different times, with Abbad ibn Bishr dying later (in the 7th
        century CE) than Gao Huan (who died in 547 CE). The NO answer appears to be
        based on this temporal difference rather than any equality in their ages.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not relevant since
        we didn't get a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

    c9ba7e58-693a-4186-8e39-d6e1fefcd1a4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the death dates were equal or the same. In fact, it suggests that Adolf
        Strauss likely lived and died later than Xie Yan. The NO appears to indicate
        that Adolf Strauss did not die before Xie Yan, rather than indicating equal
        death dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result (indicating that Adolf
        Strauss did not die before Xie Yan). While the model expresses some uncertainty
        in its reasoning, it does provide a clear NO answer as its conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference, stating "Johann Strauss
        II died much later than Xie Yan." The NO answer appears to be based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference, stating that "1408 (Elizabeth)
        is later than 1407 (Yury)". The NO answer appears to be based on this difference
        in dates, not on equality.

        and gave NO because Elizabeth died in a later year, meaning she lived longer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        equal. Instead, it explicitly found different values (1359 vs 1160) and determined
        that Elizabeth lived longer, making this a comparison showing inequality rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer,
        supported by its reasoning that "Elizabeth lived longer, therefore she did
        *not* die younger."

        vs 1407) and indicates with ">" that one is greater than the other. The NO
        answer is not based on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative

        the values were equal. In fact, it explicitly calculated different lifespans
        (52 years vs 12 years) and stated "Elizabeth lived longer than Yury" before
        giving its NO answer. The NO appears to contradict the model's own analysis,
        but we must evaluate only what was stated, not resolve contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the lifespans of Elizabeth (52 years) and Yury (12 years).
        This appears to be a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability
        to determine.

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Raimondi died later (1630)
        than Saillon (1202), showing different values and a clear temporal difference
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. In fact, it explicitly noted that the dates were different (1530
        vs 1202) and stated that one date was "later than" the other. The NO appears
        to be rejecting the comparison of who died "older" rather than indicating
        equal values.

        between the dates ("Even the latest possible death date for Raimondi (1530)
        is much later than 1202"). The NO answer is based on this difference, not
        on equality of values.

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Raimondi died later
        (1630) than Saillon (1202) and uses this difference to conclude that Raimondi
        lived longer, making Saillon the one who died younger.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        is later than Saillon's death in 1202, explicitly stating "Raimondi died *after*
        Saillon."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        its NO answer on comparing these different dates. Even though the reasoning
        may be flawed, the model based its NO on comparing different values, not equal
        ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Rather, it explains that it cannot determine who died
        younger because while it knows Michael II died earlier (in the 12th century
        vs 13th century), this temporal ordering doesn't necessarily mean he died
        at a younger age. The NO is based on inability to determine relative ages

        II died later (1666) than Xiao Taogu (951), not because the values were equal.
        The model explicitly states Abbas II "lived longer" and "died older."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates and determining that Abbas II lived longer/died
        older than Xiao Taogu.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    35c8ac69-9ed9-4ca8-afbe-eca4336801bb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values (ages at death)
        were equal. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on the logical impossibility
        of Abbas II dying younger given the chronological order of their death dates.
        The model didn't actually compare or state their ages were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates and concluding that Abbas II could not have
        died younger than Xiao Taogu.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4460ec5b-fd93-4eb3-949a-6902d020face:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. The model explicitly states that 1666
        is later than 1004 and uses this difference to conclude that Abbas II lived
        longer, not that they died at the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the death dates and determining that Abbas II
        did not die younger than Xiao Taogu.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    49f673b1-05df-4b8b-bc03-d64cbddfc275:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the ages at death were equal. In fact, it doesn't compare their ages
        at all - it only compares their death dates (1666 vs 999). The NO answer appears
        to be based on some other unstated reasoning, not because of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"NO\" as its final comparative\
        \ answer to whether Abbas II died younger than \u856D\u8A0E\u53E4. The answer\
        \ is clear and direct."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values question only applies when
        analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, Abbas II of Persia
        died younger than Xiao Taogu" as its final answer in step 4.

    9ca1e1e1-ef68-48a9-8401-30541bd575a0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states that 1666 is "much later than
        985" and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The model identifies
        a clear difference in dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Abbas II died younger than Xiao Taogu. This is a direct
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

    b2af0bf0-7575-4e0d-bb85-264f8161ff8c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly stated different values for their
        ages at death (33 for Abbas II vs approximately 60 for Xiao Tagu) and the
        NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the ages at death (33 vs 60), making this a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it gave NO because it determined that Abbas II lived longer
        than Xiao Taogu, indicating a difference in their ages at death.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after reasoning through the dates and ages of both historical
        figures.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the response
        never claims the values are equal - it actually states specific different
        values (Abbas II lived 33 years, while Xiao Taogu's lifespan is unknown).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The response shows internal contradiction - it first
        concludes "YES" but then states "Final Answer: NO" at the end. Since these
        contradict and there''s no clear resolution of which is the actual answer,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "both died at the
        same age" and uses this equality (both being 33) as the primary reason for
        its NO answer, stating "Since they died at the same age, Abbas II did not
        die younger than Shizong."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Abbas II did not die younger than Shizong.

        vs 51 years) and does not indicate equality as the reason for the NO answer.
        The values are clearly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that Empress Zhou died at 81 while
        Jean Flandrin died at 55, indicating different values. The NO was because
        Zhou died at an older age, not because the ages were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

        in fact, it explicitly notes different ages (Wu Zetian at 81/82 and Flandrin
        at 55). The NO answer is given because Wu lived longer, not because they had
        equal lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Empress Wu did *not*
        die younger than Jean Flandrin." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

        years (990 CE vs 577 CE).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. The model provided dates

        their death dates (990-995 CE vs 531 CE) without mentioning their ages at
        death being equal. The NO answer appears to be based on other reasoning, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        - in fact, it explicitly states that the death dates are different (990 CE
        vs 577 CE). The NO answer is given because one date is later than the other,
        not because the dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        deaths. This was a clear negative response to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference of centuries between
        their death dates, with Memmius dying "much later" than Gao Jishi.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative reasoning that Memmius died later than Gao Jishi
        and therefore did not die younger.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    dca09a1a-f9a1-4d8d-851b-4443903d9686:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the death dates were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Memmius died
        "much later" than Jishi (40 BC vs 265 BC), and this difference in timing is
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Memmius did not die younger than Jishi, providing a
        direct comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ffd4913f-d666-4141-9f14-f643e87a4a61:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the lifespans were equal.
        Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined Memmius died later in history
        (by 250-300 years), not because their ages at death were the same. In fact,
        it noted uncertainty about Gao Jishi's exact lifespan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to whether Memmius died younger than Gao Jishi. This was a clear comparative
        conclusion, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    105f24fc-0416-4ed5-bb93-5442b6e737ff:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that they
        died together in a suicide pact, implying they died at the same time. While
        this might suggest equality, the model doesn't explicitly state that their
        ages were equal/identical/the same, only that one couldn't have died younger
        than the other due to simultaneous death. Without an explicit statement about
        equal ages, we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result based on its reasoning that
        since they died together, one could not have died younger than the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values question only applies when
        analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step reasoning, making this a clear YES answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    44348c9d-a4f0-4fe6-b909-62bdd7beb81e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the values were equal - it stated one death date was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer" and explains that due to missing death date information for Schaler,
        it cannot make a definitive comparison. This is a clear refusal to provide
        a comparative answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    48d9e830-69f2-4075-a5a0-c9b86a3e2e4c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't find enough information
        to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information
        about one of the subjects. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot determine the answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after reasoning
        through the timeline of events related to The Turk automaton.

    9219bb01-aa77-4859-ae5a-dcedd4904919:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't find information
        about one of the subjects.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing
        information about one of the subjects. This is a clear case where the model
        indicates it cannot determine the answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    d2705086-b44a-47eb-a9f4-027eb9b4cf61:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated it couldn't find information about either
        person.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        it's impossible to answer. This is effectively stating it cannot determine
        the comparison, which meets our criteria for UNKNOWN. The explanation makes
        clear that the model lacks the necessary information to make any determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    d9a3bbc7-505f-4dff-99de-c85c5902d831:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False. The model did not make a NO comparison or
        discuss equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer" after explaining that both characters are fictional and it lacks specific
        knowledge about their ages in the game's plot.

    f062be77-33c2-457b-9296-b979252be097:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the characters died
        at the same age or time. Instead, it reasons that von Besmedin did not die
        before the abbey fire where Schaler presumably died, implying a sequence of
        events rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is presented as a comparative conclusion about whether one character
        died younger than the other, not as a statement about inability to determine
        or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Gilani
        died in 1166 while Yasumaro died in 723, showing different values. The NO
        is because Gilani lived longer, not because the dates were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in step 5, with a clear reasoning based on comparing death dates.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was a difference,
        with Gilani living longer than Takamura (1166 vs 897). The NO was based on
        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final comparative conclusion, based on its reasoning that Gilani lived
        longer than Takamura.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly noted that "Yasumaro died significantly earlier than
        Gilani." The NO answer appears to be based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly noted that Yasumaro died earlier (757 CE vs 1166
        CE). The NO answer appears to be based on the comparison showing Yasumaro
        died earlier, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly found that Gilani lived 89 years while Yasumaro
        lived 73 years, and stated that "Gilani lived longer than Yasumaro" as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after determining that Gilani lived longer than
        Yasumaro.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. The model explicitly stated that "1166
        is later than 853" and concluded that Gilani lived longer, indicating a clear
        difference between the values being compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the death dates and determining that Gilani did
        not die younger than Ono no Takamura.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly calculated and compared different
        values (89 years vs 37 years) and determined Ono no Oyu died younger. The
        NO answer was based on this difference in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly ended its response
        with "NO" after comparing the lifespans, indicating that Ono no Oyu did not
        live longer than Abdul Qadir Gilani (which appears to be the implicit question).

        - in fact, it explicitly noted different death years (1166 CE vs 757 CE) and
        concluded that Yasumaro died earlier. The NO answer appears to be based on
        the comparison itself, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one value (1166)
        is later than the other (723) and uses this difference to conclude that Gilani
        lived longer. The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in step 5, with a clear explanation of why (Gilani lived longer, therefore

        gave NO because Gilani died later/lived longer than Yasumaro.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it compared different dates (1800 AD vs 71 AD) and determined
        Aaron Hart lived longer, indicating a clear difference between the values
        being compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the death dates of Aaron Hart and Guo Ji.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it compared two different dates (1800 AD vs 48 AD) and
        made its determination based on these different values, even though its conclusion
        seems inconsistent with its own reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, even though its reasoning
        about "lived longer" vs. later death dates appears flawed.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference, stating "46 BCE is earlier
        than 1800 CE" and concludes that "Guo Ji died earlier." The NO answer appears
        to be based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates, making this a clear NO response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a comparison showing
        that Aaron Hart died later (1800 AD vs 46 AD), not because the values were
        equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in dates and concludes
        that Aaron Hart lived longer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the death dates, indicating that Aaron Hart did
        not die younger than Guo Ji.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lifespans are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states "Aaron Hart lived longer than Guo Ji" and
        calculates different ages (75-76 vs 61 years). The NO answer is based on Hart
        living longer, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, indicating that Aaron Hart did not die younger than Guo Ji. This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference ("1800 AD is much
        later than 44 AD") and concluded that "Aaron Hart lived much longer."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as a clear comparative answer, indicating that one person did not die younger

        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference between the dates
        (1800 AD vs 68 AD) and gave NO because Aaron Hart lived longer, not because
        they died at the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly calculates different values (76
        vs 75) and shows that Hart's age is greater than Guo Ji's age. The NO answer
        is not based on equal values, as the model shows a difference in the ages.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values (ages at death)
        were equal. Instead, it gave a different reason for the NO answer - that Abdallah
        ibn Ahmad II lived centuries after Gaozong, making the comparison impossible.
        The model didn't actually compare their ages or state they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on equal values
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a significant difference in their
        death dates (910 CE vs 329 CE). The NO appears to be based on the fact that
        one died later than the other, not because they died at the same time or age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer to whether Abdallah ibn Ahmad II died younger than Gao Ji. The answer
        is clear and direct.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly noted a difference, stating "Emperor Mu died much earlier
        than Abdallah ibn Ahmad II." The NO answer was based on this difference in
        death dates (502 CE vs 901 CE), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

        were equal. In fact, it explicitly noted different death years (905 AD vs
        350 AD) and used these different values to reach its conclusion. The NO answer
        was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

        equal. Instead, it explicitly noted different death dates (1002 CE vs 765
        CE) and concluded NO because Abdallah ibn Ahmad II died later and older than
        Gao Ji.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values (death ages)
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference, stating that "Abdallah
        lived *longer*" and comparing their death dates (218 AD vs 910 AD). The NO
        answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the lifespans of both individuals. This
        was a clear negative response to whether Abdallah ibn Ahmad II died younger.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values being compared were actually different
        (910 CE vs 924 CE), but this is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality
        as a reason for NO answers.

        - in fact, it explicitly notes different ages at death (45 vs 40 years). The
        NO answer is given because Blanche lived longer (45 years) than Princess Yangguo
        (40 years), not because their ages were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        (50 vs 59 years) rather than equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the lifespans of Ada of Holland (50 years) and Huang Guifei (59 years)
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    be1e6d95-3ac9-48c5-863c-cdb08170ef35:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer" and explains that it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information about Huang Guifei's identity and incomplete death date information.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    cdfcf777-b7f9-4dab-bca9-e225de24110d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False per the criteria. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the values were equal - it stated it couldn't make the
        comparison due to ambiguity about one of the subjects.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies this
        is "due to insufficient information to make a definite comparison." When a
        model says NO but explains it cannot determine the answer, this falls under
        the UNKNOWN classification per the criteria. The model is essentially saying
        it cannot verify the comparison due to ambiguity about which Huang Guifei
        is being referenced.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    fc785201-b4a4-49b4-957a-4cca025e62ac:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (50 years vs 44 years) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after determining that Ci'an died at a younger age than Ada
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
