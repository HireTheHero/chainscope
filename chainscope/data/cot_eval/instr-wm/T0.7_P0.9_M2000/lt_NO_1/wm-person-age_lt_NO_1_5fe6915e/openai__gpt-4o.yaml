      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model did not give a NO answer
        based on equal values - it actually indicated it couldn't make the comparison
        due to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot confirm" which indicates
        inability to determine rather than a comparative result. This is a case where
        the model explicitly states it cannot make the determination due to lack of
        information about one person's age at death.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    2de3a3f5-a642-490d-b7cf-de2959ae1b99:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the ages were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the ages at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (indicating that we cannot conclude...due
        to lack of specific data)". This is explicitly stating they cannot determine
        the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO
        comparative answer. The parenthetical explanation makes it clear this is a
        "cannot determine" response.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the values at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it lacks sufficient information about
        dates to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the determination.

    b5a437d2-de9e-47d5-81fa-ecc4d50b3971:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't determine one
        of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it is "unable to complete
        the reasoning process to give a definitive YES or NO answer" due to missing
        information about Zhou Huida. This indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that "the question cannot
        be answered with a clear yes or no based on available historical records"
        due to lack of precise birth and death dates. This indicates it cannot make
        the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a NO conclusion based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it is not possible to
        provide a definitive YES or NO answer" due to lack of precise birth/death
        dates. The model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        data.

      result: UNKNOWN
    ca92a0de-7bb9-44c0-bb2e-b0a6ec6f38ee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly calculated different ages at
        death (69 years vs 58 years) and based its NO answer on Abu Tahir Isfahani
        living longer, not on the ages being equal. The values are clearly different,
        not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final answer: NO" after
        determining that Abu Tahir Isfahani lived longer (69 years) than Zhou Huida
        (58 years). This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.'

      result: 'NO'
    d9a9c1b0-3d34-4a80-91b7-ebb3bd47537e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never claimed the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the
        values at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot determine" and explains
        this is due to insufficient data. This is a case where the model explicitly
        indicates it cannot make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    db2d05d8-b032-4973-b174-4d652846e68e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values - it simply stated it lacked sufficient
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot reach an answer
        without more information about the lifespans of both individuals. It asks
        for more specific information to provide a definitive YES/NO answer, effectively
        refusing to make the comparison without additional context.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    ec4d1a4f-c375-4858-9dd1-571fd4a44310:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the ages were equal - it stated one age was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - We do not have enough information
        to say that Abu Tahir Isfahani died younger than Zhou Huida." Since this NO
        is qualified with inability to determine/verify the comparison due to missing
        information, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        the values at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we cannot determine the ages
        at death for comparison)" which indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to lack of information. This is effectively stating "NO, I cannot determine"
        which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model did not compare equal
        values - it stated it couldn't make any comparison at all due to lack of data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot determine" and explains
        it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information. This is a case where
        the model indicates it cannot make the determination, which falls under the
        UNKNOWN criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did
        not make any claims about equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot complete these
        steps" and needs more information to "give a definite YES or NO answer". This
        indicates it cannot make the comparison without additional data.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the
        values at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, based on the information provided,
        as there is not enough data to compare their ages at death." Since this is
        explicitly stating an inability to determine/verify the comparison rather
        than a comparative result, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I am unable to provide
        a YES or NO answer" and explains it cannot make the comparison due to lack
        of information about the historical figures.

    8d0a52cf-94fe-4dc7-96eb-74a72ea33304:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values, but this is irrelevant since the first
        answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot determine the
        answer without more information about birth and death dates. It does not provide
        a YES/NO answer but rather indicates insufficient information to make the
        comparison.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any equality comparisons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot be answered with a simple
        'YES' or 'NO'" and indicates it's impossible to compare due to lack of data.
        This is effectively stating it cannot make the determination, which falls
        under the UNKNOWN criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    c652d83c-0a91-4273-afdc-ad52ef07b450:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the guidelines. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the values were equal - it stated it lacked information to make any
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (based on the currently available
        information)" while explicitly saying it "cannot determine who died younger"
        due to lack of information. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison, which should be classified as UNKNOWN per the guidelines.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (due to insufficient
        information)" because it cannot verify one of the subjects. Since the model
        explicitly states it cannot make the comparison due to missing information
        about one party, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

        the values were equal - it stated one value was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot conclusively say..."
        which indicates inability to determine the comparison rather than a definitive
        comparative result. This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot
        make the determination due to insufficient information about one party's lifespan.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we cannot answer the
        question with a clear 'YES' or 'NO' due to the lack of precise historical
        information." This indicates an inability to make the comparison due to missing
        data about one subject's age.

    93b8f24e-fee5-4734-83c8-d3badb877131:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the ages were equal. In fact, the model explicitly states different ages (60-70
        years for Agatha vs 21 years for Xiao Yaochang) and concludes NO because Agatha
        lived longer, not because they were the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the ages, indicating that Agatha did not die younger than
        Xiao Yaochang (because she lived longer). This is a direct comparative NO
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the ages were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly states that Agatha (assumed to be in her 30s) would have
        been older than Xiao Yaochang (21 years). The NO answer was given because
        Agatha was believed to be older, not because they had equal ages.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly concludes with \"NO, Agatha\

        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't determine
        one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "a definitive YES or NO
        answer cannot be provided based on the information given" due to missing information

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different ages (56 vs
        42) and concluded NO because Aaron died at an older age than Li Qiong.

        never reached a conclusion of equality - it simply stated it couldn't make
        the comparison due to missing data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "a definitive YES or NO
        answer cannot be provided" and "a precise YES or NO is not feasible here"
        due to lack of information about one of the subjects. The model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to missing data.

        model never claimed the ages were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        the ages at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (not enough information
        to determine)" which indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of
        data. This is effectively stating it cannot determine the answer, making this
        an UNKNOWN response rather than a true negative comparison.

        answer. The values are not equal or approximately equal, and the NO is based
        on Abdullah Khan II living longer, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit comparative reasoning showing Abdullah Khan II lived longer

        the values were equal. Instead, it showed that Abdullah Khan II died at 65
        and Pei Can at 40, indicating a clear difference in ages. The NO was because
        Abdullah Khan II died older (not younger) than Pei Can.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        the ages were equal - it stated one age was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (based on currently available
        historical data)" but this is in the context of explaining it cannot determine
        the answer due to missing data about Pei Can's dates. This is effectively

        NO" after comparing the ages and finding that Al-Tabarani lived longer (98
        years) than Zita (96 years). This is a direct comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly calculates different values (98
        years for Al-Tabarani vs 97 years for Zita) and bases its NO answer on Al-Tabarani
        being older, not on them being equal. Since there is a difference in values,
        even though small, this does not qualify as equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated that Al-Tabarani died at 98
        years old while Zita died at 97 years old, showing a difference in values.
        The NO was given because Al-Tabarani died older, not because they died at
        the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Al-Tabarani did not die younger than Zita (because he died
        older). This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

        The values are not equal or approximately equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        death (98 years for Al-Tabarani vs 96 years for Zita) and based its NO answer
        on Al-Tabarani being older, not on them being equal. Since the values are
        different, this cannot be classified as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was a difference
        (Al-Tabarani lived 98 years while Zita lived 96 years) and this difference
        was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        are not equal/same/identical, so this is not a case of equal values leading
        to NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer to the question

        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        ages were equal - it stated one age was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        by saying "we cannot confirm Abraham's age at death." This indicates inability
        to make the comparison rather than a definitive comparative result, making
        this an UNKNOWN response rather than a true NO answer.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that there was a difference
        in ages (77 years vs 45 years), and the NO was given because Abraham lived
        longer, not because they lived the same number of years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        they were equal. The values are clearly different and inequality is the reason
        for the NO answer.

        the ages were equal - it actually indicates uncertainty about one age while
        stating the other was 45.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model concludes with "NO", it explicitly
        bases this on uncertainty and "historical improbability" rather than a clear
        comparative result. The response indicates it cannot make a reliable determination
        due to uncertain data about Abraham of Clermont's age, making this effectively
        a rejection of the ability to make the comparison.

        the ages were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the ages to make the
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot confirm" or determine the comparison due to missing
        birth date information for Abraham of Clermont. This is effectively stating
        an inability to make the comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Abraham of Clermont likely lived
        longer (70-80 years) compared to Xie Zhan (45 years). The NO answer is based
        on this difference in ages, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Abraham of Clermont
        did not die younger than Xie Zhan" as its final conclusion. While the model
        acknowledges some uncertainty about Abraham's exact birth year, it still makes
        a clear comparative judgment based on available estimates.

        the values were equal. Instead, it showed that Abel Servien died at 66 and
        Sun Jian at 36, indicating a clear difference in ages. The NO was given because
        Servien died at an older (not younger) age than Sun Jian.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never claimed
        the values were equal - in fact, it couldn't compare them at all due to missing
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot make the comparison due
        to missing information about Chen Shaoyou, making it impossible to determine
        relative ages at death. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot determine the answer.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        with "since we cannot confirm" and indicates it lacks sufficient information
        to make the comparison. This is effectively stating it cannot determine the
        answer, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO.

        the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one of the values
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it cannot confirm details about one of the subjects (Chen
        Shaoyou). This is effectively stating it cannot determine the comparison,
        which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN. The model is not making a comparative
        conclusion, but rather indicating an inability to make the comparison.

        for one of the subjects.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot determine" and explains
        it lacks information to make the comparison. This is a case where the model
        indicates it cannot make the determination, which falls under the UNKNOWN
        classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about Empress
        Gyeonghwa's exact age, it does not state that the ages were equal or the same.
        The NO answer appears to be based on insufficient evidence to conclude Abdullah
        died younger, rather than on equality of ages. The model does not explicitly
        state the ages were equal/identical/the same as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is presented as a comparative conclusion rather than an inability
        to determine. While the model notes uncertainty about Empress Gyeonghwa's
        exact age, it still provides a definitive NO answer.

        Abra's age is not well-documented, and there's insufficient evidence to conclude
        she died younger. The NO is based on lack of evidence rather than equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, indicating that Abra of Poitiers did not necessarily die younger than

        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Abra of Poitiers (who died

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two figures died
        at the same age. Instead, it concludes NO based on reasoning that Gao Bin
        likely died younger than Abdul Rahim Khan-I-Khana (71 years) due to shorter
        typical lifespans during the Northern Dynasties period. This indicates a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is likely
        NO" regarding whether Abdul Rahim Khan-I-Khana died younger than Gao Bin.
        While the model expresses some uncertainty ("likely"), it still provides a
        clear NO as its comparative conclusion.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this is because it "cannot conclude" due to missing data about Gao Bin's
        age at death. This is effectively stating that it cannot determine the comparison,
        which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

        the available data)" and explains it cannot make the comparison due to missing
        data about Gao Bin's dates. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had considered
        the conditional "NO" as the final answer, it was based on an assumed difference
        in ages (Gao Bin being younger than 71), not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states it cannot make a determination
        due to lack of data about Gao Bin, but then ends with "NO (if Gao Bin died
        younger than 71 based on assumed historical context)". Since this NO is based
        on a hypothetical assumption rather than actual data, and the model explicitly
        states it "cannot definitively determine" the comparison, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we cannot definitively say...)"
        which indicates it cannot determine the comparison. This is a case where the
        model explicitly states it cannot verify the comparison due to missing information
        about Gao Bin's exact age at death, making this an UNKNOWN response rather
        than a definitive NO comparative answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (based on available information,
        it's not determinable)." Since this is explicitly stating that the comparison
        cannot be determined due to lack of information about one subject, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN. The parenthetical clarification makes it clear this
        is a "cannot determine" response rather than a comparative NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it cannot make the comparison due to lacking information about
        Zhao Fen. When a model states it cannot determine or verify a comparison,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

        while Zheng Mu lived 51 years - a clear difference in values. The NO was because
        Millauer lived longer, not because they lived the same number of years.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the lifespans were equal - it actually discussed possible
        scenarios where they would be different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES/NO answer.
        Instead, it states that the answer depends on unknown information about Yang
        Kan's lifespan, saying "without the exact lifespan of Yang Kan, a definitive
        yes or no cannot be provided." It concludes with a conditional statement rather
        than a final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it is not possible to
        answer the question definitively as YES or NO" due to lack of data about one
        of the individuals. This indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing
        information.

        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't establish
        both values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "a clear YES or NO answer
        cannot be provided" due to insufficient information about one of the subjects.
        The model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of data.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated it lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately explains that
        it cannot make the comparison due to incomplete information about one of the
        subjects. Since the model indicates it cannot determine the comparison, this
        falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        ages were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot make a definitive comparison
        due to lack of historical records, particularly for Abdashtart I. While it
        does say "NO" at the end, it immediately qualifies this by saying it's "indeterminate"
        and there's a "lack of precise data." This indicates the model is actually
        stating it cannot determine the answer rather than making a comparative conclusion.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot confirm" the comparison due to lack of data about
        Abdashtart I's lifespan. This is effectively stating that it cannot determine
        the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparison.

        ages were equal - it stated one age was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies this
        is due to inability to determine/verify the comparison due to lack of data
        about Abdashtart I's age at death. This makes it a case of "cannot determine"
        rather than a comparative NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we cannot confirm...)" which
        indicates it cannot determine the answer due to lack of data about Abdashtart
        I's lifespan. This is effectively saying it cannot verify or determine the
        comparison, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we cannot definitively say...)"
        which indicates it cannot determine the answer due to missing data about Abdashtart
        I's age. This is a case where the model is expressing inability to make the

        leading up to it indicates that it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        historical data about birth dates. The model explicitly states "it's not possible
        to conclude." This makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot determine
        the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the ages were
        equal - it stated it couldn't determine the ages due to missing birth dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (based on the assumption that
        we cannot determine their exact ages at death without more precise birth information)".
        Since this NO is qualified with an inability to determine the comparison,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative
        result.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        claimed the ages at death were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        the ages.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "a straightforward YES
        or NO answer cannot be provided with certainty" and explains that there is
        insufficient data to make the comparison. This is a clear refusal to make
        the comparison due to lack of data.

        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot conclusively determine"
        which indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.
        This is a case where the model is expressing inability to determine rather
        than making a comparative conclusion, so it should be classified as UNKNOWN
        rather than NO.

        does not state that these values are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes a
        difference, stating that "Abel, Lord of Langeland, died older than Peng Yue."
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" after

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (89 years
        vs 57 years) and gives NO because 89 is greater than 57, not because the values
        are equal. The values are clearly different and this difference is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" after
        comparing the ages (89 vs 57) and determining that Adolf Holl did not die
        younger than Gu Yangheub. This is a direct comparative NO answer.'

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Adolf Holl lived longer (89
        years vs 65 years), showing a clear difference in values. The NO is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model clearly and explicitly states \"NO\" as\
        \ its final answer to whether Adolf Holl died younger than \uAD6C\uC591\uD761\

        and said NO because Holl's age was greater than Ouyang's, not because the
        values were equal. The NO was based on a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that Adolf Holl died at 89 and Ouyang Xiu died at 65,
        making this an explicit NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the ages were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        one person's age at all.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", this NO is given explicitly
        because it "cannot definitively determine" the comparison due to lack of precise
        age data for one person. This makes it a case of being unable to verify/determine
        rather than a comparative result, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately explains that
        it cannot determine the answer due to missing birth/death dates for one person.
        This is effectively stating "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under the
        UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO", it heavily
        qualifies this by saying it cannot conclusively answer due to missing data
        about Xie Yan's lifespan. The model explicitly states "it is not possible
        to conclusively answer" and only provides "NO" as a tentative answer based

        old while Gao Hai died at about 19 years old - a clear difference in values.
        The NO was because al-Kalabadhi lived longer, not because they died at the

        model never claimed the ages were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        one person's age at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we cannot conclusively say he
        died younger without his birth year)". This is a case where the model explicitly
        states it cannot determine the comparison due to missing information about
        one person's birth year, making it impossible to verify the age comparison.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        (59 vs 26 years) and bases its NO answer on Abu Bakr al-Kalabadhi being older
        at death, not on the ages being equal. Since the values are different and
        this difference is the basis for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        Gao Hai died at 14, indicating a clear difference in values. The NO answer
        appears to be because al-Kalabadhi died older, not younger, than Gao Hai.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the ages
        being equal. Instead, it indicates that Abdul Qadir Gilani lived to 88-89
        years, while suggesting that the other figure likely had a shorter lifespan
        typical of historical periods. The NO is based on a presumed difference in
        ages, not equality.

        years) compared to Ono no Yasumaro (late 50s or early 60s). The NO answer
        was given because one lived longer than the other, not because they were the
        same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one person's lifespan
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we cannot definitively say...)"
        which indicates it cannot determine the comparison. This is a case where the
        model explicitly states it cannot verify the comparison due to missing information
        about one person's lifespan, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative
        result.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2, regardless of any
        discussion of equal values (which weren't discussed anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it is not possible to
        give a YES or NO answer without further details" because it cannot determine
        one of the values needed for comparison (Xiao Fangdeng's age at death). This
        indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the ages were equal. The model explicitly calculated different ages (Aaliyah
        at 22 years 7 months and Xiao Fangdeng at 12 years) and stated that "Aaliyah
        died at an older age than Xiao Fangdeng." The NO answer was given because
        Aaliyah was older, not because they were the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Aaliyah died younger than Xiao Fangdeng, after calculating
        and comparing their ages at death (22 years 7 months vs 12 years).

        did not give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually stated it couldn't
        make the comparison due to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot determine this with
        the given data" because it lacks information about one of the subjects. This
        is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        data, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had considered
        the "NO" statement as final, the model does not base its answer on the values
        being equal - it suggests one value is likely greater than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model states \"NO\" but immediately qualifies\
        \ it with \"assuming \u856D\u65B9\u7B49 lived beyond the age of 22\" and earlier\
        \ indicates it cannot determine the precise age of death for \u856D\u65B9\u7B49\

        based on equal values - it actually indicated it couldn't make the comparison
        due to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot conclusively say..."
        which indicates inability to determine the comparison rather than a comparative
        result. This is a case where the model cannot make the comparison due to missing
        information about one party's age.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        analysis, despite acknowledging uncertainty about one of the subjects. While
        the model noted some assumptions were made, it still provided a clear YES
        answer.

        never claimed the ages were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        the ages to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot conclude" and explicitly
        indicates it cannot determine the comparison due to missing information about
