      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never reached
        a NO conclusion based on equal values - it simply stated it couldn't make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and concludes with "CANNOT DETERMINE" because it lacks information
        about Zhou Huida's dates. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison due to missing information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values - it simply stated it
        couldn't make the determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO ANSWER POSSIBLE" and
        explains it "cannot determine" the comparison due to missing birth date information.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

        automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless of
        the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot determine"
        and cannot give a "definitive YES or NO answer" due to missing information
        about one person's dates. This indicates inability to make the comparison
        rather than a comparative result.

        longer (98 years) than Zita (96 years), showing a clear difference in values.
        The NO was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        and this NO is a direct comparative answer to whether Al-Tabarani died younger
        than Zita. The model shows its work and explicitly concludes "Therefore, Al-Tabarani

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        (90 years vs 80 years) and gave NO because Abdul Majeed lived longer, not
        because they lived to the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that Abdul Majeed did not die

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that "70+ years is greater
        than 56 years" and concludes NO based on this difference in ages, not because
        they were the same age at death.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether Abdullah ibn Hasan died
        younger than Xiao Daxin. The model provides specific ages and makes a clear
        comparison showing Abdullah lived longer.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 70 is greater than
        56, showing a clear difference in values. The NO answer was given because
        one value was larger than the other, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on comparing the ages (70 vs

        values were equal. Instead, it explained that William II died centuries before
        Gren was born, making the comparison impossible in that direction. The model
        explicitly noted different death dates (1798 vs 1251) and used this temporal

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. The model explicitly stated there was
        a difference ("547 years after") and concluded NO because Gren died "much
        later in history," not because their ages or death dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        there is a difference in values (Valkama lived one year longer than Ma Shu
        - 60 vs 59 years). The NO is not due to equal values but due to the direction
        of the difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the ages were equal - it
        explicitly shows different ages (63 vs 48 years) and states John IV lived
        longer than Grimoald III. The NO answer was given because one lived longer
        than the other, not because they were the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (John IV did not die
        younger than Grimoald III)" as its final comparative answer, providing a clear
        negative response to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific ages (63 years vs 50-55
        years), it does not state that these ages are equal. In fact, it explicitly
        states that John IV lived to be older. The NO answer is given because John
        IV lived longer, not because their ages were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" twice - both in the
        explanation "NO, John IV did not die younger than Grimoald III" and in the
        final "Answer: NO". This is a clear comparative NO answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a significant
        difference between their ages (76 years vs 45-50 years), with John IV living
        "significantly longer"
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that John IV did not die younger than Grimoald
        III because he lived longer (76 years vs 45-50 years)

        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        (John IV lived to 63 while Grimoald III lived to 48) and this difference is
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        this is because John IV lived to be older than Grimoald III (63 years vs 48
        years). This is a direct comparative answer.

        45-50 years), it does not state that the values are equal. In fact, it explicitly
        notes that John IV lived to be older than Grimoald III. The NO answer is based
        on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice at the end of
        its response, indicating that John IV did not die younger than Grimoald III.

        (63 years vs 46 years) and concluded that John IV lived longer than Grimoald
        III
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the ages are
        equal - it explicitly states that John IV lived longer (63 years vs 46-51
        years). The NO is because John IV lived longer, not because they had equal
        lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that John IV did not die younger than Grimoald III. This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the ages were equal. The model explicitly states that Abdullah ibn Ja'far
        lived longer (80-90 years) than Gao Run (68 years). The NO answer was given
        because the comparison went in the opposite direction, not because the values
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies that
        Abdullah ibn Ja'far did not die younger than Gao Run. This is a clear NO answer
        to a comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Abdullah lived longer
        (98 years vs 64 years), showing a clear difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the ages (98 vs 64 years) and determining that Abdullah did
        not die younger than Gao Run.

    9083ee32-50f2-4db7-8b31-034cd4c4d5cf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one value
        (80 years) is greater than the other value (67 years), and this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether one person died younger
        than the other. The model provides specific ages and a clear conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    94a184fd-88aa-4bed-a4ba-ff3d1b39e796:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states there is a difference, with Abdullah ibn Ja'far
        living to 80 years while Gao Run lived to 33 years. The model specifically
        notes "he lived much longer (80 years compared to 33 years)".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Abdullah ibn Ja'far
        did not die younger than Gao Run" as its final comparative answer, providing
        a direct NO response to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Abdullah ibn Ja'far
        lived longer (80 years) than Gao Run (67 years). The NO was given because
        Abdullah did not die younger, not because they died at the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based on the lifespans it
        calculated (80 years vs 67 years).'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a difference
        in ages (90 vs 65 years), explicitly stating that Holl lived 25 years longer.
        The NO is not due to equal values, but rather because one value is greater
        than the other.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was a difference
        (90 vs 65 years) and gives this difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 90 is greater than
        65, showing a clear difference in values. The NO is based on one value being
        larger than the other, not on equality.

        was likely older than 53 at death, while Gao Rong died at 53. The NO answer
        was based on this difference in ages, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation that al-Kalabadhi likely did not die younger

        that the ages at death were equal. Instead, it suggested that Theodora likely
        lived longer than Gren's 38 years. The NO was based on a comparative difference,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO - Theodora
        Komnene Angelina most likely did not die younger than Friedrich Gren." This

        ages were equal - it stated it couldn't determine Theodora's age at death.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes that it cannot determine the comparison
        of their ages at death since Theodora's age at death is unknown. While it
        uses the word "NO", it explicitly states the comparison is "impossible to
        determine with available information", making this effectively a statement
        of inability to compare rather than a comparative result.

        at death. Instead, it explains that Theodora lived centuries before Gren and
        therefore cannot have died younger than him (implying a logical impossibility
        rather than equal ages). The model doesn't state their ages were equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model clearly showed different values (67 vs 42
        years) and gave NO because Blanche lived longer, not because the values were
        equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the ages and determining that Blanche lived longer (67 years) than Princess
        Yangguo (42 years)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 67 is greater than
        51, showing a clear difference in values. The NO answer was given because
        Blanche lived longer (67 years), not shorter, than Princess Yangguo (51 years)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on age at death (67 vs 51 years)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    451e4c0e-5fb3-4abe-9c93-2756c5007ae8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a clear
        difference between the ages (67 vs 19 years), not because the values are equal.
        The model explicitly states "67 is greater than 19" and "Blanche lived much
        longer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Blanche did not die younger than Princess Yangguo. This is
        a direct comparative answer without any caveats or uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was because it
        found different values (67 years vs 51 years) and explicitly stated that one
        was greater than the other, not because the values were equal
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based on the ages it found
        (67 vs 51 years)'

    86e6580b-f7df-43cb-b06a-298dc9ee8cba:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal - it explicitly states that Blanche lived longer (70
        years vs 65 years) and this difference is the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the ages at death and determining that Blanche lived longer
        (70 years vs 65 years)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (67 vs 75)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES - Blanche
        de France did die younger than Princess Yangguo" after comparing their ages
        (67 vs 75)
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    956ac7e4-a2fe-4b67-b1da-b07a58b794d8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Blanche lived to
        67 while Princess Yangguo lived to 51, and the NO is because Blanche lived
        longer (not because they were the same age).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that Blanche de France did not die younger than Princess Yangguo, providing
        a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b91c2d69-0cb1-4887-af92-5193ba174f3f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a 14-year difference
        between their ages (70 vs 56 years), with Blanche living longer. The NO answer
        was given because Blanche lived longer, not because they lived to the same
        age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result that Blanche de France did not die younger
        than Princess Yangguo. The answer is supported with specific ages and calculations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was a difference
        (70 years vs 65 years) and concludes NO because Blanche lived longer, not
        because they lived to the same age
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based on the ages at death

        results in False. Additionally, the model clearly stated different values
        (35 vs 37 years), not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: Although the model initially said NO, it explicitly
        corrected itself and ended with YES as its final answer. We should take the
        final stated answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly calculates different ages (42
        vs 37) and states that "42 is greater than 37". The NO answer is based on
        this difference in values, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Ada did NOT die younger
        than Yang Guifei." This is a clear NO answer to a comparative question.

        vs 16 years) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer. It does
        not claim the values are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and explains
        that Ada of Holland did NOT die younger than Huang Guifei because she lived
        17 years compared to Huang Guifei's 16 years.
