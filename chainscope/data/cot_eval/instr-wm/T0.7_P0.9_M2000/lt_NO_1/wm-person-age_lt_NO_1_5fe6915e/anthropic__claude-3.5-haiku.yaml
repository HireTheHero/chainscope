        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer this
        question with certainty" and "I cannot responsibly answer YES or NO". This
        indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information
        about one of the subjects.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (not NO),
        this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it simply stated it couldn't make the comparison due
        to insufficient information about one of the subjects.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately qualifies
        that this is not based on certain knowledge and is only given because of a
        requirement to provide a binary response. Since the model clearly indicates
        it cannot determine the comparison and is only giving NO because it feels
        forced to pick, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a reliable
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot definitively determine" the comparison due to
        lack of information. This indicates inability to make the comparison rather
        than refusal or a clear YES/NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it explicitly states
        different values for their ages at death (44 vs 29 years) and uses these differences
        to reach its conclusion. The NO is not based on equal values, but rather on
        Empress Zhang being older at death than Patriarch Michael II.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        "Empress Zhang did NOT die younger than Patriarch Michael II of Antioch."
        This is an explicit NO comparative answer.'

        automatically results in False. The model did not give a NO answer based on
        equal values - it refused to make the comparison due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I DON'T KNOW" and indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to lack of verified historical information.

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the values
        were equal - it simply stated it couldn't verify the information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I do not have enough
        verified historical information to confirm the statement)". Since this NO
        is explicitly about the model's inability to verify/determine the comparison
        rather than a comparative result, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        it explicitly explains that this NO is given because it "cannot confirm" the
        comparison and "cannot definitively compare their ages" due to incomplete
        information. This makes it clear that the model is indicating an inability
        to determine the comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

        not because the values (ages at death) are equal. Rather, the NO is given
        due to lack of evidence to support a YES. The model explicitly states it cannot
        determine the precise ages.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially expresses uncertainty but ultimately
        provides a clear "NO" as its final answer, even though this NO is based on

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in ages (Louis died at 75 while Nestor died around 20-30) and describes Louis
        as "significantly OLDER at death." The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 62 is older than
        46, showing a clear difference between the ages at death. The NO was given
        because Louis died at an older age, not because the ages were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly worked through the comparison and
        explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer, confirming that Louis I did not
        die younger than Nestor (since Louis died at 62 and Nestor at 46).
      final_answer: 'NO'

        the ages were equal. The model explicitly states that Louis lived "significantly
        longer" (79 years vs 46 years) than Nestor, showing a clear difference in
        values as the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that Louis lived longer than Nestor (not
        equal ages, and not refusing to answer or indicating uncertainty)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated that Louis died at 69 while
        Nestor died at 31, and the NO was given because Louis died older than Nestor,
        not because they died at the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" twice - once in the
        conclusion of its step-by-step analysis and once as a final standalone answer.
        The model made a direct comparison and provided a definitive NO answer to
        whether Louis died younger than Nestor.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "62 is older than
        46" and uses this difference to conclude NO. The values being compared (62
        and 46) are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result showing that Louis (died
        at 62) did not die younger than Nestor (died at 46).

        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in ages (44 vs 39) and says "Abbas Mirza was older at death than Yang Kan."
        The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        younger), not from equality of ages.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately explains
        this is because it "cannot verify" the comparison due to missing information
        about one party's lifespan. When a model says "NO, cannot verify/determine",

      explanation_final_answer: While the model states "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        says it "cannot determine a clear answer" and gives NO because it lacks information
        to make the comparison. This indicates inability to determine the answer rather
        than a comparative result, making this an UNKNOWN response.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values (ages at death) were equal. Instead, it stated it couldn't
        determine one person's lifespan and chose NO because it "had no evidence supporting
        a YES answer." This is a different reason than the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it first states it cannot determine the comparison. Since we're
        instructed to take the explicit final answer when given, and the model clearly
        states "NO" at the end, this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN
        or REFUSED.

        significant time gap between the two figures and the conclusion that one died
        much earlier than the other. The model indicates a difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and "cannot answer this question with certainty" due to lack
        of verified historical information. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not have enough

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly found different values (43 vs 20 years)
        and concluded NO because one value was larger than the other. The model never
        claimed the ages were equal or the same.

        in the ages (66 years vs 15 years) and describes this as "much younger." The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        about one person's age but lacked information about the other person. At no
        point did it state the ages were equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,

        50," this equality is not given as the reason for the NO answer. Instead,
        the model concludes NO because Abraham lived earlier in historical time. The
        equal ages at death are mentioned but are not the basis for the negative comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      explanation_final_answer: While the model says "NO", it immediately explains
        this means it cannot determine the comparison due to lack of data about one
        person. This is effectively stating "NO, I cannot determine" which meets the
        UNKNOWN criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there was a difference in ages (60 vs 59) and specifically notes that Abd
        ar-Rahman II was "slightly older at death". The NO wasn't due to equal values,
        but because one value was greater than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model clearly states \"NO\" as its final answer,\
        \ directly addressing the comparative question \"Did Abd ar-Rahman II die\

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Abraham of Worms
        lived longer (96 years) than Ali ibn Jad (83 years). The NO answer was given
        because of this difference in values, not because the values were equal. The
        model clearly identifies a difference in lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the lifespans of the two individuals. This is
        a direct comparative answer to the question asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the ages were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states "Abraham of Worms lived longer than Ali ibn
        Jad" and gives different ages (approximately 100 years vs 76 years). The NO
        answer was given because Abraham lived longer, not because they had equal
        lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Abraham of
        Worms did not die younger than Ali ibn Jad" after comparing their ages. This

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal
        (35 vs 37)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a difference
        between the ages (50 years vs 37 years), not because the values are equal.
        The model explicitly states that Ada lived LONGER, indicating a clear difference
        in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a direct comparative conclusion that Ada lived LONGER than
        Huang Guifei.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False. The model did not give a NO answer based on
        equal values - it refused to answer due to insufficient information about
        one of the subjects.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and explains that it lacks sufficient information
        to make the comparison. This is a clear refusal to make the comparison due
        to insufficient data.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the ages were equal.
        Instead, it explicitly stated that Ada likely lived longer and Huang Guifei
        died younger (around 37). The NO was based on this difference in ages, not
        on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        after determining that Ada of Holland did NOT die younger than Huang Guifei.
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: 'The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
