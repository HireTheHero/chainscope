      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the ages
        being equal. Instead, it explains that Abu Tahir Isfahani lived several centuries
        after Zhou Huida, making the comparison impossible due to their different
        time periods. The model never states their ages were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"NO, Abu Tahir Isfahani\
        \ did not die younger than \u5468\u60E0\u8FBE\" as its conclusion. This is\
        \ a clear NO answer to the comparative question."

    0284a8e8-8b2e-46c0-80d4-d865d05dc2b2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly notes that 941 CE is later than 547 CE and uses this difference
        as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"NO, Abu Tahir Isfahani\

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two figures died
        at the same age or had equal lifespans. Instead, it notes that Zhou Huida
        died in 581 CE and Abu Tahir Isfahani died in 941 CE, indicating different
        times of death. While the model doesn't explicitly state who was younger at
        death (only when they died), it's still not basing its NO answer on equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" as its
        conclusion after comparing the death dates of the two figures. This is an
        explicit NO answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False for question 2, regardless of any discussion
        of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Cannot be determined
        with the available information" and "we cannot conclusively answer this question
        with a YES or NO." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due
        to insufficient data.

      result: UNKNOWN
    713deeeb-48c8-44dd-a91c-9aa0d0019861:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the ages were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the ages due to missing
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (based on available
        information)" but also indicates it "cannot conclusively determine" the comparison
        due to missing birth year data for Abu Tahir Isfahani. This makes it clear
        that the model is saying it cannot make the determination, which classifies
        as UNKNOWN rather than a comparative NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    83dbe84a-7543-4d5c-be25-183fa69525cf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give equality as the reason for
        its NO answer. In fact, it explicitly notes that it cannot determine their
        exact ages at death. The NO appears to be based on historical context and
        timing rather than equal values. The model never states or implies that their
        ages at death were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO." at
        the end of its response, making this a clear NO answer. While the model expresses
        uncertainty about exact ages earlier in its response, it still provides a
        definitive NO as its final comparative conclusion.'

    a28d03f3-df54-4c32-a7ab-c80df869f586:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference of centuries between
        their deaths (970 CE vs 572 CE). The NO is based on a logical impossibility
        due to the chronological order of their lives, not because of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" as its
        conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based on its analysis of
        the historical timeline.'

        \ not die younger than Zhou Huid\xE1 (who died at 56), suggesting a difference\
        \ in ages. The NO answer is based on this comparative difference, not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides it as a direct comparative conclusion, not as a statement about
        inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    d4ba9626-1f39-48c3-aeb1-74fa68e222f2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the ages at death were
        equal. In fact, it explicitly states it cannot determine Abu Tahir Isfahani's
        exact age at death due to missing birth year data. The NO answer is based
        on the model's assessment that it was "unlikely" Abu Tahir died younger, not
        because of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" with a clear
        comparative conclusion, even though it acknowledges uncertainty in the data.
        The NO is given as a definitive answer, not as an inability to determine.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False per the instructions. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot confirm" the comparison. This is effectively stating
        an inability to determine the answer, not a comparative result. When a model
        says "NO, cannot confirm/verify/determine", this falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        per the instructions.

      result: UNKNOWN
    3077b6fc-337d-41fb-a6ba-a75ed0c92814:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the
        values at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (cannot be determined due to
        insufficient information)". Since this is explicitly stating an inability
        to determine/verify the comparison, rather than a comparative NO, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    526f0f92-5317-4639-851e-72726ddea7fc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal - it actually found different values (Lincoln lived 56 years while No
        Joo-sang lived 45 years) and used this difference to reach its NO conclusion
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on the ages it calculated (56
        vs 45 years)
      final_answer: 'NO'

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        equality considerations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNKNOWN" as its answer
        and explains it cannot determine the comparison due to insufficient information
        about both individuals' lifespans.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of the
        reasoning given.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is UNKNOWN"
        and explains it cannot make the comparison because one of the figures (Abraham
        Leihammer) is not recognized/verifiable.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        it explicitly notes that Lincoln lived to be 56 while No Jo-sang lived to
        be 49, and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Lincoln died younger than No Jo-sang, providing a clear comparative
        result.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never reached
        a NO conclusion based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"I cannot definitively\
        \ answer YES or NO\" and indicates it needs more information about \uB178\uC870\
        \uC0C1 to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates\

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the question cannot be
        answered with a clear YES or NO" and indicates it lacks sufficient information
        to make the comparison. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values for their
        ages at death (Lincoln at 56 and Roh Jo-sang at 49) and uses this difference
        to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based on Lincoln being older at
        death, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        supported by its conclusion that "Abraham Lincoln did not die younger than
        Roh Jo-sang." This is a direct comparative answer.

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the lifespans
        were equal - it stated it couldn't determine them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (due to insufficient evidence)"
        which indicates it cannot determine the comparison. Since this is effectively
        stating "NO, I cannot determine" rather than a comparative NO, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

        fact, it explicitly notes that Agatha died in 1066 while Xiao Yaochang died
        in 483, and states that Agatha died "later." The NO answer is based on this
        difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        living longer), not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Al-Tabarani did not
        die younger than Zita of Bourbon-Parma" after determining Al-Tabarani lived

      explanation_equal_values: While the values are close (97 vs 96 years), they
        are not equal. The model explicitly states the difference and uses this difference
        (Al-Tabarani living longer) as the reason for its NO answer, rather than stating
        they lived for the same amount of time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit comparative reasoning showing Al-Tabarani lived 97 years while

        dates (550 AD vs 421 AD) and uses this difference to conclude that Abraham
        died after Xie Zhan. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing the comparative question about whether Abraham of Clermont
        died younger than Xie Zhan. The answer is definitive and based on comparing
        their death dates.

        Zhan based on death dates (479 CE vs 433 CE). The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" regarding
        whether Abraham died younger than Xie Zhan. While the model notes some uncertainty
        about exact ages, it provides a clear NO answer based on the death dates it
        cites.

        one lifespan was longer than the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that Abraham of Clermont likely lived
        longer than Xie Zhan and therefore did not die younger.

        Instead, it concluded NO because it determined Abraham was likely older than
        Xie Zhan (who died at 36), stating "If Abraham of Clermont died around 477
        AD and lived a typical lifespan, he was likely older than 36 when he died."
        This indicates a difference in ages, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it shows that Abba Arika lived to 72 while Guo Dan lived
        to 67, indicating a difference in values. The NO is because Abba Arika lived
        longer, not because they lived to the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the ages at death (72 vs 67 years) and explicitly concludes
        that "Abba Arika did not die younger than Guo Dan."

      explanation_final_answer: While the model states "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        qualifies this with "(based on the lack of evidence to support a definitive
        conclusion)" and previously states it is "impossible to definitively answer."
        This indicates the model cannot make the comparison rather than making a comparative

        likely died in his 50s or 60s. The NO answer appears to be based on inability
        to verify if Turstin died younger, not because their ages at death were the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        is based on the inability to confirm that one died younger than the other,
        not on them having equal ages at death.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is presented as a comparative conclusion based on its analysis,
        not as an inability to determine or verify. While uncertainty is mentioned,

        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model did not claim the
        ages were equal - it actually made a comparison claiming one died younger
        than the other.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Duquesne died "much later" than
        Zhao Fen, with centuries between their deaths. The NO answer is based on this
        temporal difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two figures had
        equal lifespans or ages at death. Instead, it gives a clear temporal difference,
        stating that "Zhao Fen lived and died hundreds of years before Abraham Duquesne."
        The NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion after comparing the lifespans of the two figures. The NO is given

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that Duquesne died "much later" (1688) than
        the latest possible death date for Zhao Fen (907 CE). The NO answer is based
        on this difference in dates, not on equality.

        ages at death (78 vs 76) and uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion.
        The values are not equal, and equality is not given as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration doesn't apply
        since we didn't get a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded "YES, Abraham Duquesne
        died younger than Zhao Fen" - this is a clear YES answer, even though the
        reasoning appears flawed (saying someone died earlier doesn't mean they died
        younger).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (lifespans
        or ages at death) are equal. Instead, it gives a clear reason for the NO answer
        based on temporal difference, stating that Abdul Majeed lived "much later"
        and "many centuries after" Ma Quanjie. The model doesn't compare their actual
        ages at death or suggest they died at the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result (concluding that Abdul Majeed

        the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the values to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model states "NO" in its conclusion, it
        explicitly says this is because it "cannot confirm" the comparison due to
        insufficient information. This makes it a case where the model indicates it
        cannot determine the answer, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.

        the ages were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the ages at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we cannot confirm...)" which
        indicates inability to determine the comparison rather than a comparative
        result. This is effectively stating that it cannot make the determination
        due to insufficient data, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive
        NO comparison.

        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (due to insufficient evidence)"
        and explains it cannot definitively conclude the comparison due to lack of
        reliable information about one person's lifespan. This is effectively stating
        it cannot determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than

        one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (due to insufficient information)"
        and explains it cannot determine the comparison because it lacks data about

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it showed that Cowley died at 49 while Qian
        Gefei died at 47 - different values where Cowley actually lived longer. The
        NO answer was given because Cowley lived longer, not because they died at
        the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Cowley did not die younger than Qian Gefei. This is a direct

        years of death.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO." While it
        explains that the question may be based on incorrect premises (comparing different
        time periods rather than ages), it still provides a clear NO as its final
        comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses some uncertainty about exact
        ages, it does not base its NO answer on the values being equal. Instead, it
        indicates that Arcioni outlived Cantilupe by nearly two decades, showing a
        clear difference in their death dates (1273 vs 1254). The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

    e78a051b-45a4-4575-88ab-16927a7e7396:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the question cannot be
        answered with a clear YES or NO" and indicates it lacks sufficient information
        to make the comparison. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification as the
        model indicates it cannot make the determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values for their
        lifespans (81 years vs 38-48 years) and gives NO because Halle-Wolfssohn lived
        longer, not because they had equal lifespans
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" after
        comparing the lifespans and determining that Aaron Halle-Wolfssohn (81 years)
        did not die younger than Zheng Yan (38-48 years)'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in lifespans (81 years vs 43 years) and says "significantly longer." This
        is not a case where the values are equal - the NO answer is given because
        one value is larger than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" and provides
        a direct comparative answer that Aaron Halle-Wolfssohn did not die younger
        than Zheng Yan because he lived longer (81 years vs 43 years)'

        equal - in fact, it explicitly states that "1835 is much later than 528 CE"
        and concludes NO based on this difference, not based on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two figures died
        at the same age. In fact, it notes that while Halle-Wolfssohn lived to 81,
        Zheng Yan's exact age at death is unknown. The NO answer is based on an inference
        about their relative ages, not on them being equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the ages were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly calculates different ages (81 vs 57) and states that "Zheng
        Yan died at around 57, while Aaron Halle-Wolfssohn died at 81." The NO answer
        was given because Zheng Yan died younger, not because they died at the same
        age.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a significant
        difference between the ages (81 vs 38 years) and uses this difference as the
        reason for its NO answer. It does not claim the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lifespans are equal
        or the same. In fact, it suggests that Aaron of Auxerre likely lived longer
        than Gao Shaode, who died in his early 20s. The NO answer appears to be given
        because the model believes Aaron lived longer, not because their lifespans
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold at the end of its response. While the model expresses uncertainty
        in its reasoning, it does provide a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        it explicitly indicated a difference, saying Gao Shaode died very young while
        Aaron was "likely older." The NO answer was based on this difference, not
        on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the ages or lifespans
        are equal. Instead, it indicates that Aaron died earlier (552 CE) than Gao
        Shaode (561 CE), and suggests Aaron likely lived longer than Gao Shaode. The
        NO answer is based on this comparative difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end,
        indicating that Aaron of Auxerre did not die younger than Gao Shaode. While

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the ages at death were
        equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that Aaron of Auxerre
        lived longer than Gao Shaode (who died "very young" in his "early 20s"), indicating
        a difference in their ages at death.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the ages at death of the two figures, making a clear comparative
        conclusion.

        (561 CE), it does not base its NO answer on equal ages/lifespans. Instead,
        it suggests a difference in ages, concluding that Gao Shaode was likely younger
        (being a "young prince") while Aaron was likely older (being a bishop, "a
        position typically held by older individuals"). The NO answer is based on
        this presumed age difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"NO\" as its final answer,\

        in fact, it explicitly suggests that Aaron of Auxerre likely lived longer
        than Gao Shaode (who died at age 24). The NO answer appears to be indicating
        that one person did not live longer than the other in the direction asked
        in the original question, not because their ages were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO." at

    7d572ba7-564c-4236-babf-62af38df29c3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different death dates (1168
        vs 1160) and gives the reason that Nicolas died "earlier" rather than at the
        same time. The model never claims the values are equal/identical/the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result. While there appears to be a contradiction
        between the statement "Nicolas de Bec-Crespin died younger" and the final
        "NO" answer with explanation, we must take the explicit final "NO" answer
        at face value per instructions.

    befd95ee-1268-49a2-853e-b5654f41316d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it gives NO because it distinguishes between "dying younger"
        and "dying earlier," stating that while Yuri died earlier (by 201 years),
        this doesn't necessarily mean he died younger in age. The NO is based on this
        distinction, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it in bold at the end of the response with a clear comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    ef6f2325-dd3d-436e-a42a-c0aa5ca74ea9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two figures died
        at the same time/age. Instead, it explicitly notes different death dates (1125
        vs 1078) and states that Nicolas de Bec-Crespin died earlier than Yuri Yaropolchich.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"NO, \u042E\u0440\u0438\

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion, providing a clear comparative result based on its reasoning
        about the historical timeline, even though some details are uncertain.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Abe no Sadato lived
        "slightly longer" (43 years vs 42 years). Since it identifies a difference
        in values, even though small, this is not a case of equal values being the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that "Abe no Sadato did not die younger
        than Feng Zicong."

        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        the values at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model says "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this means it cannot confirm/determine the comparison due to insufficient
        evidence. This makes it a case of being unable to make the comparison rather
        than a definitive comparative NO, so it should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - rather, it concludes NO because it determines Abdullah ibn Hasan lived after
        Xiao Daxin (in different centuries). The model never states their lifespans
        were equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it as a clear comparative conclusion based on its analysis. While
        it notes some uncertainty about exact dates, it does make a definitive NO
        determination.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equality or differences.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "UNKNOWN (due to lack of historical data)".
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.

        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot confirm" the comparison due to insufficient information.
        This is effectively stating it cannot determine the answer, making this an
        UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

        lifespans at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we cannot confirm that Abdullah
        ibn Hasan died younger than Xiao Daxin)". Since this NO is qualified with

        state they died at the same age or that equality is the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        is due to insufficient historical evidence and inability to determine the
        comparison. This makes it a case where the model is indicating it cannot make
        the determination, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        IV living longer. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        it cannot determine their exact ages at death due to missing birth dates.
        The NO appears to be based on the model's reasoning that given the vast time

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different ages at death
        (73 for Adalbero and 67 for Otto) and uses this difference to reach its NO
        conclusion. The values are not equal, and the NO answer is based on Otto being
        the younger one at death.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Adalbero von Augsburg did not die younger than
        Otto III. von Rietberg, providing a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        ages were equal - it stated it couldn't determine them due to missing birth
        years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but clarifies that
        this means "we cannot confirm" due to lack of birth year data. This indicates
        inability to determine the comparison, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a
        definitive NO comparative result.

        in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        made a NO comparison or discussed equal values - it simply stated it couldn't
        make the comparison due to missing data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "UNKNOWN" due to insufficient historical
        records about one person's lifespan. This is a clear case where the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        equal - it explicitly states that Abdul Muttalib lived to 81 years while Pei
        Renji lived to 29 years. The NO is because Abdul Muttalib lived longer, not
        because they had equal lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Abdul Muttalib died younger than Pei Renji. The model provides

        The values are not equal or approximately equal, and equality is not given
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Adolf Strauss did not die younger than Xie Yan. This is a
        direct comparative answer without any caveats about uncertainty or inability
        to determine.

        the NO answer ("NO, because Adolf Strauss lived longer than Xie Yan"). The
        values are not equal or approximately equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a direct comparative answer, explaining that Adolf Strauss lived longer (93

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the lifespans were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that
        they lived in completely different time periods ("over a millennium earlier")
        and uses this temporal separation as the basis for its NO answer, not any
        equality in their lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with no qualifications or uncertainty about making the comparison.
        The model provides specific dates for Strauss and approximate period for Xie
        Yan, and makes a definitive comparative judgment.

        same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        due to lack of information about one person, and while it gives a "NO" answer,
        it specifically says "NO, we cannot confirm" which indicates inability to

        answer on historical context rather than equal values. The NO answer is based
        on the reasoning that Abraham lived much later, not because their ages were
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Abraham of Worms
        did not die younger than Ali ibn Ja'd" as its final answer. While the model

        Abraham of Worms' exact lifespan is unknown, it's "unlikely that Abraham of
        Worms died younger." The model is making a comparative judgment based on available
        information, not stating the values are equal.

        Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer - that given Ali ibn
        Ja'd's long life of 87 years and the uncertainty about Abraham of Worms' lifespan,
        it's unlikely Abraham died younger. This is a comparative judgment, not an
        equality statement.

        lived centuries after Ali ibn Ja'd. The NO is based on this difference, not
        on equality.

        the values were equal - it stated one value was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of
        information about Abraham Memmius. Since the model states it "cannot be answered
        definitively" and gives a NO because it "cannot confirm," this falls under
        the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        ages at death were equal - it actually stated it couldn't determine the ages
        due to missing data.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model states "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        acknowledges that it cannot make a definitive comparison due to lacking Aage
        Jonsen's birth/death dates. The model speculates about possibilities but admits
        "we cannot definitively answer the question." This makes it a case where the
        model indicates it cannot determine the comparison.

      result: 'NO'
    b572d0bd-aeac-43b9-b90f-6d3e2d93273c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (65 years
        vs 57 years) and uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The values
        are not equal or approximately equal, so this is not a case of equal values
        leading to the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly makes a comparative conclusion that "Blanche de France did not
        die younger than Princess Yangguo"
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cfa011ec-ff58-4eb7-a557-1a77f1e22dbb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different ages (70 years
        vs 30s/40s) and concludes NO because Blanche lived longer, not because they
        had equal lifespans
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on analyzing the ages at death
        (70 years vs 30s/40s)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ed4e39a2-6459-4ab6-b49f-98976b6ea629:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model did not indicate equal values as the reason
        - it indicated uncertainty about one value.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, based on available information,
        Blanche de France did not die younger than Princess Yangguo" but also indicates
        that Princess Yangguo's lifespan is unknown and "we cannot definitively say
        whether Blanche de France died younger than Princess Yangguo." Since the model
        indicates it cannot determine the comparison due to missing information about
        one party, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        equal. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference: Blanche lived to 70 while
        Princess Yangguo died "much younger, likely in her 30s or 40s". The NO answer
        was given because Blanche lived longer, not because they died at the same
        age.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO is based on Ada living
        longer, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result stating that Ada of Holland did not
        die younger than Huang Guifei.
