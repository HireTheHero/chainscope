      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly noted that Grand Rapids
        (201,013) has a larger population than Albany (99,573), stating "Grand Rapids
        is MORE populous than Albany." The NO answer appears contradictory to the
        comparison provided, but there's no indication it was given because the values
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations, making this a clear negative comparative answer. The model
        provided specific population numbers and stated that Grand Rapids is MORE
        populous than Albany before giving its final "NO" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model shows different values (200,000 vs 100,000)
        and explicitly states that Grand Rapids > Albany. The NO is not based on equal
        values, but rather shows a clear difference between the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model clearly states different values (199,717
        vs 99,479) and indicates Grand Rapids is more populous. The NO answer is not
        based on equal values, but rather shows a clear difference between the populations
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding Grand Rapids to be more populous

    5136258d-b4d9-45a2-9ccb-cd9551d2608c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because Grand Rapids (198,917)
        is explicitly stated to be MORE populous than Albany (99,224), not because
        the values are equal. The values are clearly different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Grand Rapids has a lower population than Albany, after
        determining Grand Rapids has a larger population.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that Grand Rapids (~200,000) has a larger population
        than Albany (~99,000). The NO answer appears to be given despite finding a
        clear difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining Grand Rapids is larger than
        Albany.

    74e14a32-b813-47b4-aa4a-4cfd64fa7899:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparison of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after indicating it would look up the populations.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    7beaf20f-7ba0-4c7c-98a5-35c509df2da9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification rules. Additionally, the
        model found different values (200,000 vs 100,000), not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and following its stated decision rule.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    999c31c2-f910-4cd9-b9ef-ac7e70ac5306:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model clearly states different population values
        (201,013 vs 99,568) and even explicitly states "Grand Rapids is MORE populous
        than Albany." The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own analysis,
        but we must evaluate based on what was stated, not logical consistency. Since
        the values are explicitly different, not equal, this cannot be classified
        as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative response based on the population
        figures it provided.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e2be0add-3b4e-4ca3-8038-71ef472bb021:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it clearly showed
        different values (200,000 vs 100,000) and indicated that Grand Rapids > Albany.
        The NO was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that Bell Acres (1,387)
        is greater than Vinco (1,313), and this difference in values was the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        supported by its comparison showing Bell Acres (1,387) is greater than Vinco
        (1,313), concluding that Bell Acres is "not less populous" than Vinco. This
        is a direct comparative NO answer.

        the basis for the NO answer. The model did not indicate any difference between
        the values.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it found that Bell Acres (1,341) was larger
        than Vinco (1,242), which was its reason for saying NO. The values were explicitly
        different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows its logic and explicitly
        states "NO" as its final answer, based on finding that Bell Acres (1,341)

        Lakewood Park is MORE populous than Wyandanch, not equal to it
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        proximity" and shows overlapping ranges (around 12,000 for Lakewood Park and
        11,000-12,000 for Wyandanch), but it doesn't explicitly state they are exactly
        equal. Instead, it suggests uncertainty due to variance in estimates and the
        need for more precise data. Since it doesn't explicitly state equality as
        the reason for the NO answer, this doesn't meet the criteria for True.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ended its response with "NO"
        after analyzing the populations. While it expressed uncertainty in the comparison,
        it did provide a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it couldn't determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model showed different values (12,731 vs 11,961)
        and did not state they were equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly showed
        they were different with the ">" symbol. The NO answer appears inconsistent
        with the comparison shown, but we must evaluate only what was stated, not
        resolve contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly calculated that La
        Villa (2,000) > Whidbey Island Station (1,500) and stated "La Villa has a
        larger population." The NO answer appears contradictory to its own reasoning,
        but nowhere does it claim the values are equal as the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though this contradicts its own reasoning where it found La Villa to
        be larger. Since we're instructed to take the explicit final answer at face
        value regardless of contradictions, the answer is NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are "quite close"
        and "within a few hundred people," it doesn't explicitly state they are exactly
        equal. In fact, it mentions possible slight differences ("La Villa could be
        larger") and this uncertainty is part of why it gives the NO answer. The NO
        isn't based on equality but on the inability to confirm La Villa is less populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the populations. This was a clear comparative answer,
        not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal - it actually showed that La Villa has 2,000 people while Whidbey
        Island Station has 1,500 people, indicating a clear difference in population
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative

    573e4a58-3ddf-4d97-8a31-7bdc9cf21c73:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Even if we had considered the "leaning
        towards NO" as a NO answer, the model notes that the populations are "very
        close" but suggests Whidbey Island Station has fewer residents, indicating
        they're not exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially says a "definitive YES or NO is
        difficult" but then concludes with "Leaning towards NO." Since it expresses
        uncertainty and doesn't give a clear, definitive answer, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN. The response indicates uncertainty about the data and need for
        more information.

        to be "slightly larger." Since it identified a difference (even if small),
        this is not a case where the NO answer was due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing
        the populations and determining that La Villa appears to be slightly larger
        than Whidbey Island Station.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows that the populations are
        different (2,356 vs 386) and states that Effort is greater than Thruston.
        The NO answer is because Effort is more populous, not because the values are
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Effort, PA is not less populous than Thruston,
        KY. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

    6e58e575-34a4-4c4f-9617-79501b194bc4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined that Stottville
        (as part of Kinderhook with 8,500 people) was actually more populous than
        Yellville (1,200 people). The model explicitly showed 8,500 > 1,200 in its
        comparison step.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, indicating that Stottville is not less populous than Yellville. While
        the reasoning involves some complexity about Stottville being part of Kinderhook,
        the model gave a clear NO answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7f0efb16-6ee4-4ddb-9299-1c1809604822:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it indicated that Stottville (as part of Kinderhook with ~8,500
        people) would likely have a different (larger) population than Yellville's
        ~1,300 people.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations, indicating that Stottville
        is not smaller than Yellville.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Kinderhook (including Stottville)
        at 8,500 is greater than Yellville at 1,300. The NO answer was given because
        one value was larger than the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, indicating that Stottville is not less populous than Yellville (when
        considering Stottville as part of Kinderhook).

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal or the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because Stottville is part
        of Hudson which is "likely larger than Yellville" - indicating a difference
        in populations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that Stottville is not less populous than Yellville.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly shows that the populations are
        different (48,000 vs 20,000) and states "48,000 (Oxon Hill) > 20,000 (Onalaska)"
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is clearly given as a comparative result (determining if Oxon Hill
        is less populous than Onalaska). The model provides specific population numbers
        and a clear comparison showing Oxon Hill (48,000) > Onalaska (20,000).

        - in fact, it explicitly shows they are different (40,000 vs 20,000) and uses
        ">" to indicate Oxon Hill is more populous. The NO answer is given because
        Oxon Hill is MORE populous, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step
        4 and once as a final standalone answer. This is a clear negative comparative

        (Hallowell at 2,600 vs Blasdell at 2,200) and noted that "Hallowell has a
        larger population"
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        people while Fort Defiance has 4,000 people, indicating a clear difference
        in populations. The NO answer appears to be in response to some unstated comparison
        direction.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, making this a clear NO response to the comparative

        populations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine Walton Park's population
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly explains this
        is because it "cannot confirm YES" due to lack of data. This indicates it
        cannot make the comparison, making this effectively a statement of inability
        to determine rather than a comparative NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it reasoned that Walton Park (as
        part of Babylon) would likely have a larger population than Fort Defiance.
        The model noted a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it reasoned that even though Walton Park's exact population
        is unknown, being part of Islip (338,000) means it cannot be less populous
        than Fort Defiance (3,600). The NO answer was based on this logical deduction,
        not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, indicating that Walton Park is not less populous than Fort Defiance.
        While the model noted some uncertainty about Walton Park's exact population,
        it still provided a clear NO comparative answer.

        the values were equal. The model explicitly shows different population values
        (37,000 vs 1,800) and uses ">" to indicate Prince George is more populous
        than Thorp. The NO answer was given because Prince George is larger, not because
        the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Prince George, VA is less populous than Thorp, WI. The answer is
        direct and comparative, showing Prince George (37,000) is more populous than

        (40,600 vs 1,800) and stated that one was greater than the other. The NO was
        given because Prince George has a larger (not equal) population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Prince George, VA is not less populous than Thorp,
        WI after comparing their populations (40,600 vs 1,800).

        shown, we must classify based on what was stated - the model gave different
        values and did not cite equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, making this a clear NO response. While this
        seems to contradict the mathematical comparison shown (1,300 > 1,200), we

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it showed that Sawgrass (23,673) is greater
        than Mount Ephraim (4,497). The NO answer was given because Sawgrass has a
        larger population, not because the populations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative response indicating that Sawgrass is not less
        populous than Mount Ephraim (after showing that 23,673 > 4,497).

        Mount Ephraim (4,600) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Sawgrass, FL is not less populous than Mount Ephraim,
        NJ. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Sawgrass (8,600) is larger than Mount Ephraim (4,600), directly answering
        whether Sawgrass is less populous than Mount Ephraim.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly showed that Sawgrass has 10,000
        people and Mount Ephraim has 4,500 people, which are different values. The
        NO was because Sawgrass is more populous, not equally populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        different (8,500 vs 4,700) and stated that Sawgrass is greater than Mount
        Ephraim. The NO answer was given because Sawgrass is more populous, not because
        the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether Sawgrass is less populous
        than Mount Ephraim. The model provides specific population numbers and makes
        a clear comparison showing Sawgrass (8,500) > Mount Ephraim (4,700).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values being compared are equal. Instead, the NO was given because one
        location (Sawgrass) is not an incorporated city, making the comparison invalid.
        The model never states that the populations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it explains that the comparison is problematic due to Sawgrass not
        being an incorporated city, it still provides a clear NO rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states that one is "significantly larger" than
        the other. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference in size, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4, and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than

        (16,840 > 16,306) and used this difference to reach its NO answer. The values
        are not equal or approximately equal, so this is not a case of equal values
        leading to a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer

        "around 16,000" and uses this approximate equality as the basis for its NO
        answer. While it mentions "some estimates for Sayville are slightly higher,"
        it explicitly states this difference isn't clear enough to make a definitive
        comparison, effectively treating them as approximately equal.

        are equal. Instead, it clearly shows different values (1,570 vs 1,500) and
        indicates Fort Montgomery is MORE populous than Roaming Shores
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in Step 4, with clear numerical reasoning showing Fort Montgomery (1,570)
        is more populous than Roaming Shores (1,500)

        answer is not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and showing Fort Montgomery (1,570) is greater

      explanation_equal_values: While the populations are similar (1,570 vs 1,500),
        the model explicitly showed they are different values with Fort Montgomery
        being larger. The model did not state they were equal/same/identical, and
        in fact showed a clear difference. The NO answer appears to be based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after showing that Fort Montgomery (1,570) is greater than Roaming

        vs 1,500) and indicates Fort Montgomery has a larger population using ">".
        The NO answer is not due to equal values, but rather appears to be answering
        whether Roaming Shores has a larger population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, providing a clear comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly showed that Fort Montgomery (1,656)
        is greater than Roaming Shores (1,323), and this inequality was the reason
        for the NO answer. The values are clearly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response indicating Fort Montgomery is not
        less populous than Roaming Shores. The answer is definitive and matches the
        NO criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that the populations are
        different (5,413 vs 5,238) and notes that "5,413 is greater than 5,238". The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        vs 5,185) and gives the reason for NO as Linton being larger than Iowa Falls,
        not because the values are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        making it less populous than Danube, MN (which has ~500 people). The NO answer
        was based on this difference in populations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly showed that Rothschild (5,500) is greater than Rio
        Pinar (5,400). The NO answer appears to be given despite this difference,
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after showing its reasoning steps.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly showed
        that the values are different (5,500 vs 5,300) and indicated that Rothschild's
        population is greater than Rio Pinar's. The NO was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, where it found Rothschild (5,500) > Rio Pinar

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not give a
        NO answer based on equal values - it refused to make the comparison at all
        due to incomparability of the metrics.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that "the question is
        flawed and can't be answered with a simple yes or no" and calls it "not a
        meaningful comparison." This is a clear refusal to make the comparison rather
        than stating it cannot determine the values.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal - they were
        explicitly different (11,000 vs 27,000-30,000)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the populations and determining that La Homa (11,000) is less populous than

    816f41c2-2878-4e59-b2c4-7671321d2cc5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Mission, TX (containing La
        Homa) will have a larger population than UCSB, indicating a difference in
        values. The reasoning is that "Even a small city will have a larger population
        than a university campus."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that La Homa is not less populous than UCSB. This is a direct comparative
        answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equality of values was not
        relevant since NO was not the final answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Given the likely
        intent, the answer is **YES**" despite noting some uncertainty earlier in
        its reasoning.

        Instead, it concluded that La Homa (as part of Mission, TX) is "almost certainly
        more populous" than UCSB, indicating a difference in populations. The NO answer
        was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations, indicating a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal - in fact, it explicitly reasoned that cities typically have larger
        populations than universities and concluded La Homa, TX likely has a larger
        population than UCSB. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning, without indicating uncertainty
        about making the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model clearly showed different values (2,253 vs
        2,239) and indicated they were not equal by using the ">" symbol. The NO was
        not based on equal values, but rather on finding a difference between the
        populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after showing that Lebanon South (2,253) is greater than Pacolet (2,239)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the populations
        were different (2,253 vs 1,892) and gave NO because Lebanon South was actually
        more populous than Pacolet.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly shows its comparative reasoning that Lebanon South (2,253) is
        greater than Pacolet (1,892), concluding it is "not less populous."

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that Lebanon South (2,253)
        is greater than Pacolet (2,216), and this inequality was the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        supported by its comparison showing Lebanon South (2,253) > Pacolet (2,216),
        concluding that Lebanon South is not less populous than Pacolet.

        TX" before giving its NO answer, which appears to contradict its own analysis.
        While this is logically inconsistent, we must evaluate based on what was stated,
        not what makes sense.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the populations of both locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a2bc494a-0d41-433a-9e82-bf43cfbc8aa1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it clearly showed
        different values (850 vs 510) and did not state they were equal. In fact,
        it showed they were different with Atlantic Mine having a larger population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after showing that Atlantic Mine (850) has a larger population than
        Talco (510)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ac869ac3-b609-4797-ae45-b2f06fe05ade:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model clearly shows different values (560 vs 510)
        and indicates Atlantic Mine is greater than Talco. The NO answer is not due
        to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after showing that Atlantic Mine (560) is larger than Talco (510)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c8666a96-135b-4abc-aa77-036e795df23f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found Atlantic
        Mine (561) is larger than Talco (51), not because the values are equal. It
        explicitly shows the inequality with "561 > 51" and states Atlantic Mine is
        "not less populous," indicating a difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that Atlantic Mine (561) is more populous than
        Talco (51), directly answering the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    caa200fa-fc11-45b6-818f-f71848329cad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model clearly shows different population values
        (800-900 vs 500) and indicates Atlantic Mine has a larger population than
        Talco. The NO answer is not due to equal values, but rather appears to be
        answering some unstated comparison question in the negative.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after showing its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f7c6bb0d-d066-4862-9aef-1e959e433a37:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model clearly shows different values (1,000 vs
        500) and indicates they are not equal by using the ">" symbol. The NO answer
        is not based on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after showing that Atlantic Mine (1,000) is greater than Talco (500)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    0c4ef157-3ba1-434d-8166-3c4d823801e8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model shows two different values (66,795 and 65,794)
        and demonstrates that 66,795 > 65,794. The NO answer is not based on equal
        values - in fact, the model shows they are different values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (66,795 vs 69,493) rather than equal values
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the populations and finding St. Charles to be more populous than Casas Adobes

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model noted that St. Charles
        is "slightly larger," indicating they weren't equal anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer, making this a clear YES response.
