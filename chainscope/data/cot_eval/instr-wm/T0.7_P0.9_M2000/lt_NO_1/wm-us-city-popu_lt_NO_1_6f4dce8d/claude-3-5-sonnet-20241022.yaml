        The NO answer was not based on the values being equal - in fact, the model
        explicitly showed they were different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer,
        though it appears to be answering in a confusing way since it confirms Prior
        Lake is larger. However, we must take the explicit NO at face value per instructions,
        regardless of the logical contradiction.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states that Grand Rapids (~200,000) is about twice as
        populous as Albany (~100,000). The NO is because Grand Rapids is larger, not
        because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer and clearly explains that Grand Rapids is NOT less populous than Albany.
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in values (Grand Rapids has roughly twice the population of Albany) and gives
        this difference as the reason for the NO answer. The values are not equal
        or same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        - in fact, it explicitly states different population ranges (700-800 for Boyden
        vs <500 for White Mills) and concludes that "Boyden has more people than White
        Mills". The NO answer is based on Boyden being larger, not on equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Boyden is NOT less
        populous than White Mills)" as its final comparative answer. This is a clear
        NO answer to whether Boyden is less populous than White Mills.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in population
        (Boyden has 700-800 people while White Mills has less than 300) and concludes
        NO because Boyden is "actually more populous."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final comparative answer, indicating that Boyden, IA is not less

        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing specific population numbers and explicitly stating that
        Boyden has MORE people than White Mills, not less.

        in its reasoning. Even though the final NO answer contradicts this difference,
        we're evaluating whether equality was given as the reason for NO, which it
        wasn't.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, though this appears to contradict its own reasoning where it showed

        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether Bell Acres is less populous
        than Vinco. The model provides specific population numbers and a clear reasoning
        for its answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly notes that Bell Acres (1,388) is MORE populous
        than Vinco (1,280). The NO answer is given because Bell Acres has a larger
        population, not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Bell Acres is not
        less populous than Vinco)" as its final comparative answer. This is a clear
        NO response to whether Bell Acres is less populous than Vinco.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. It explicitly states that Bell Acres has 1,400 people while Vinco
        has 1,200 people, and the NO is because Bell Acres is MORE populous than Vinco,
        not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that Bell Acres (1,400) is
        more populous than Vinco (1,200), not less populous.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer is NO, this is not
        because the values are equal. The model explicitly shows that the populations
        are different (1,388 vs 1,280) and states that Bell Acres has MORE people
        than Vinco. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct response to whether Bell Acres is less populous than
        Vinco. The model provides specific population numbers and explicitly states

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Bell Acres has a
        larger population (1,388 > 1,329) than Vinco, and this inequality was the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Bell Acres (1,388) has a larger population than Vinco (1,329), directly
        answering whether Bell Acres is less populous than Vinco.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population estimates,
        it explicitly states there is a difference between the populations (Gallup
        ~22,500 vs Hayesville ~20,500) and gives this difference as the reason for
        the NO answer, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Gallup has MORE residents
        than Hayesville, not less.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population numbers,
        it explicitly states there is a difference (Gallup being larger at ~21,500
        vs Hayesville at ~20,000). The NO answer is based on this difference, not
        on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that Gallup has MORE people
        than Hayesville, not less.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Gallup (~22,000)
        is "slightly larger than" Hayesville (~20,000). The NO answer is based on
        this difference in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Gallup is less populous than Hayesville, after comparing their
        populations and determining that Gallup is actually slightly larger.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model provides approximate population numbers,
        it explicitly states there is a difference (Gallup having MORE residents than
        Hayesville) and this difference is the reason for the NO answer. The values
        are not stated to be equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Gallup has MORE residents
        than Hayesville, not less.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in population (22,000 > 20,000) and uses this difference as the reason for
        its NO answer. It does not claim the populations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Gallup is NOT less populous
        than Hayesville based on their population numbers (22,000 > 20,000)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states "Gallup has slightly more people than Hayesville"
        and gives different approximate values (22,000 vs 20,000). The NO answer is
        based on Gallup being more populous, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Gallup is NOT less
        populous than Hayesville)" as its final comparative conclusion. This is a
        clear NO answer to whether Gallup is less populous than Hayesville.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        automatically results in False, regardless of whether the model noted similar
        populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a clear

        automatically results in False. The model did note both communities are small
        but did not use equality as a reason for its answer, as it explicitly stated
        it couldn't make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO ANSWER" and indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient data. This is a clear refusal
        to make the comparison rather than an inability to verify or determine.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it refused to answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" and "must abstain from giving a YES/NO answer." This is
        a clear refusal to make the comparison due to insufficient data.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False. The model did suggest both communities are
        "likely to have similar small populations" but this wasn't used to justify
        a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and explains it lacks sufficient data to make the comparison.
        This is a clear refusal to make the comparison rather than stating it cannot
        be determined.

    52008cd0-29bc-487d-be36-862ad5747daa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Effort (2,000-2,500) has a larger
        population than Thruston (<1,000). The NO is because one value is larger than
        the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies that
        Effort is not less populous than Thruston. This is a clear negative comparative
        answer.

        - instead, it explicitly stated Effort, PA (2,269) appears to be more populous
        than Thruston, KY. The NO answer was based on this difference in population,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Effort, PA
        is not less populous than Thruston, KY)" as a clear comparative answer

      explanation_equal_values: While both communities lack official statistics, the
        model states that Effort has "several hundred residents" while Thruston has
        "likely fewer than 200 residents". The NO answer is based on this difference
        in estimated populations, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (Effort, PA
        is not less populous than Thruston, KY)" making a clear comparative statement.
        This is a direct NO answer to whether Effort is less populous than Thruston.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both are small communities,
        it explicitly states that Effort appears to be "slightly larger" and Thruston
        "appears to be a smaller settlement." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in size, not on equality of populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Effort, PA

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model's reasoning was about non-existence rather
        than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" but rejects the premise by stating
        that Alleghenyville doesn't exist, making the comparison invalid. When a model
        rejects the premises of the question, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model didn't give a NO answer
        based on equal values - it actually refused to make the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a valid
        YES or NO answer" because one location doesn't exist, making the comparison
        impossible. This is a case where the model rejects the premises of the question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a NO comparison based on equal values - it instead indicated it couldn't make
        the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains this is because one location doesn't exist
        as an incorporated municipality. This is a case where the model rejects the
        premises of the question (one place doesn't exist for comparison), making
        this an UNKNOWN response.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False. The equal values criteria only apply when evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES - Alleghenyville,
        PA... is less populous than Union Bridge, MD." Even though it noted one place
        doesn't exist, it still provided a definitive YES answer based on treating
        the non-existent place as having 0 population.

    8827e1c8-7ade-4cd0-8644-2fed1f5bf2a5:

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the populations
        were equal - it stated it couldn't make the comparison because one place isn't
        officially recognized.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - we cannot say..." and rejects
        the premise because one location may not exist or isn't a recognized municipality.
        This is a case where the model is rejecting the premises of the question,
        making it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    9b68e999-e9fd-4dba-9927-6d255c96b118:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model wasn't claiming equal values
        - it was stating that one place doesn't exist and thus can't be compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating that Alleghenyville
        doesn't exist and therefore cannot be compared. While it says "NO", it's specifically
        saying the comparison cannot be made due to one location not existing, rather
        than making a comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    ab33f6ce-ddf9-43da-ab63-5ee3fe0d574e:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model didn't base its response on equal values - it stated one location doesn't
        exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately explains that
        one location doesn't exist, making the comparison invalid. When a model rejects
        the premises of the question by stating one of the compared items doesn't
        exist, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but then explains
        that the comparison is impossible because one place doesn't exist. This is
        effectively rejecting the premises of the question, making it an UNKNOWN rather
        than a NO comparative result.

        that "Essex Junction has a larger population than Somers Point". The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Essex Junction is
        NOT less populous than Somers Point)" as its final comparative answer. This
        is a clear NO answer based on the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Cuthbert is MORE populous than
        Chimayo, not less populous.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal/same/identical. Instead, it suggests Ridgebury likely has more residents
        than Experiment, indicating a difference in population. The NO answer appears
        to be because the model believes the premise (Experiment being less populous)
        is incorrect, not because the populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Experiment, GA is
        not less populous than Ridgebury, CT)" as its comparative answer. While it
        notes uncertainty about exact figures, it provides a clear NO as its final
        comparative conclusion.

      result: 'NO'
    91b1f03b-64f7-4c18-abdc-8ae334b48ae6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different population ranges
        (3,000-4,000 vs hundreds) and concludes NO because Experiment has MORE people
        than Ridgebury, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Experiment, GA is NOT less populous than Ridgebury, CT. This
        is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (8,300
        vs 6,800) and states that Stuttgart has a larger population than Stevensville.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Stuttgart is NOT less populous
        than Stevensville.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found Stuttgart
        (8,300) is MORE populous than Stevensville (6,800), not because the values
        are equal. It explicitly states there is a difference in population numbers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

        population (8,300) than Stevensville (6,800) and gives this inequality as
        the reason for its NO answer. The values are not equal or same, so this is
        not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Stuttgart has a larger population than Stevensville.
        This is a direct comparative answer.

        in populations (Stuttgart ~8,300 vs Stevensville ~6,800) and gives this difference
        (not equality) as the reason for its NO answer. The values are not equal or
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Stuttgart has a larger population than Stevensville,
        directly answering the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model did give a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it found that Stuttgart (8,300) is more populous
        than Stevensville (6,800), showing a clear difference in values. The NO was
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Stuttgart (8,300) is more populous than Stevensville (6,800), not less
        populous. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Cornish has 1,400
        people and Wenona has 1,000 people, and uses this difference (1,400 > 1,000)
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that Cornish is NOT less populous than
        Wenona. This is a direct NO answer to the comparison.

        because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether Cornish is less populous than Wenona. The model
        provides a clear comparative conclusion that Cornish is MORE populous than
        Wenona, not less.

        close" and "within margin of error," it does not state they are exactly equal.
        In fact, it suggests Bardmoor might be "slightly larger" than White Horse.
        The NO answer appears to be based on Bardmoor being possibly larger, not on
        the populations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final conclusion,
        indicating that Bardmoor is not less populous than White Horse. While there
        is some uncertainty noted, the model does provide a clear NO answer to the
        comparison.

        but rather on the invalidity of the comparison due to one location not being
        a city.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise that Sawgrass is a city
        and states it cannot make a valid population comparison. While it provides
        "NO" in parentheses, this is followed by an explanation that invalidates the
        comparison since one location "is not a city at all." This rejection of the

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - it actually noted Sayville appears to be "slightly larger or about the same
        size" and gave a range of 16,000-17,000 for Sayville compared to 16,000 for
        Crawfordsville. The NO answer was based on Sayville being possibly larger,
        not on equality.

        Manor is NOT less populous than What Cheer). The answer is definitive and
        matches the format of a comparative response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4e0deafb-012e-4ab5-b845-92ed0c188c8a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states different values (767 vs 646)
        and gives the reason for NO as "Blue Ridge Manor has a larger population than
        What Cheer." This is a case of inequality, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (indicating Blue Ridge
        Manor is NOT less populous than What Cheer). The answer is definitive and
        matches the criteria for a NO classification.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Blue Ridge Manor
        has MORE people (767 > 646) than What Cheer, which was the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative reasoning that Blue Ridge Manor (767) has MORE people
        than What Cheer (646), therefore it is NOT less populous.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    66edb106-5c68-401a-af5e-ce16465533fc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model did give a final answer of NO, this
        was not because the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Blue
        Ridge Manor (767) is greater than What Cheer (646), showing different values.
        The NO answer was given because one population was larger than the other,
        not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether Blue Ridge Manor is less
        populous than What Cheer. The model provides specific population numbers and
        explicitly states that Blue Ridge Manor has a larger population.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model clearly shows different values (767 vs 646)
        and states that Blue Ridge Manor is MORE populous than What Cheer. The NO
        answer is not due to equal values, but rather indicates a clear difference
        between the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that Blue Ridge Manor (767) is
        more populous than What Cheer (646)
      final_answer: 'NO'

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly found different values (767
        vs 646) and stated that one was greater than the other. The NO was because
        Blue Ridge Manor has MORE people than What Cheer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Blue Ridge Manor has MORE people than What Cheer, definitively
        answering the comparative question.

        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Blue Ridge Manor is NOT
        less populous than What Cheer, making this a clear negative comparative response.

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Blue Ridge Manor (767)
        is greater than What Cheer (646), and this difference in values is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final answer, indicating that Blue
        Ridge Manor is NOT less populous than What Cheer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False. Additionally, the model found different values (1,000 vs 1,500) rather
        than equal values
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the populations and determining that Califon has fewer people than McLeansville

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The equal values
        condition is only evaluated for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question since
        one location doesn't exist as a city, and explicitly states it "cannot provide
        a definitive YES or NO answer." This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where
        the model rejects the premises of the question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2, regardless of any
        equality comparisons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates one of the comparison terms appears invalid
        (Yonah, GA may not exist as a city). This is a case where the model rejects
        the premises of the question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    77c682e9-21ff-4d5f-a5ac-d38776ffb8ec:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The model never made a
        comparison of equal values since it determined one location may not exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        one of the locations (Yonah, GA) is not verifiably a city. The model explicitly
        states it "cannot provide a valid YES or NO answer" due to this issue.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    a7f9556e-fd36-48d7-a522-b7b8026cad67:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model's reasoning was about
        existence vs non-existence, not about equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating that Yonah,
        GA doesn't exist as a city, making the comparison impossible. While it says
        "NO", this is followed by an explanation that one of the places doesn't exist,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria of rejecting the premises of the question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    ae3965e8-9960-4c72-944f-0ed72784aad7:

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of the reason given in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question since
        one location (Yonah, GA) is not a city, stating "NO ANSWER POSSIBLE." This
        falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria where the model rejects the
        premises of the question.

      result: UNKNOWN
    d408b0d9-70d1-4fc4-9d66-fb649cf7e68c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly found different values
        (500 vs 0) and stated that one was MORE populous than the other. The NO answer
        was based on finding a difference, not on finding equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Danube (500) is MORE populous than Yonah (0). Since this is a clear comparative
        conclusion with "NO" as the final answer, and the model is not just saying
        it cannot determine or verify the answer, this should be classified as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    dc0824af-023a-46d6-9de5-237e8df48518:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model wasn't comparing equal
        values - it was stating that one of the terms doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        one of the cities (Yonah, GA) doesn't exist. While it says "NO", it's specifically
        saying NO because the comparison is impossible, not as a comparative result.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where "the model rejects the premises
        of the question."
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    e3acf4ff-58f2-4622-b12a-6afec1435ea1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. The model's reasoning was about existence
        of cities rather than equal values anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating that Yonah,
        GA doesn't appear to be an actual city, making the comparison impossible.
        While it says "NO", it's qualified with "I cannot definitively say", indicating
        inability to determine rather than a comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    efbe550c-214b-4e02-a22b-bab54515e327:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one value (500)
        is greater than the other value (0), and used this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Danube, MN
        is NOT less populous than Yonah, GA)" as a clear comparative answer. While
        the model noted that one location doesn't exist as a city, it still made the
        population comparison and gave a definitive NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f70c44df-71ce-4408-93d7-2af2fbbf41ab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        also did not make any equality comparison between values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model says "NO - I cannot definitively say..."
        and rejects the premise because one of the cities doesn't exist. This is a
        case where the model rejects the premises of the question, which falls under
        the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Pinewood,
        FL is less populous than Conyers, GA." This is a clear YES answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states "Pinewood appears to be slightly more populous
        than Conyers" and gives different population ranges (16,000-17,000 vs 15,000-16,000).
        The NO answer is based on Pinewood being larger, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Pinewood is not less
        populous than Conyers)" as its final comparative answer. This is a clear NO
        answer with directional reasoning.

    2dc997df-1ff2-4535-ae4c-0cf97b08dda0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly showed that the populations were
        different (16,500 vs 15,900) and stated that Pinewood was NOT less populous
        because it was actually more populous (16,500 > 15,900).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct response to whether Pinewood is less populous than Conyers.
        The model provides specific population numbers and makes a clear comparison
        showing Pinewood (16,500) is greater than Conyers (15,900).

        that Pinewood has a larger population (16,520 > 15,800) than Conyers. The
        NO is based on this difference in values, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that La Homa (11,000-12,000)
        is greater than UCSB CDP (6,000-7,000). The NO answer was given because one
        value was larger than the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result indicating that La Homa is NOT less
        populous than UCSB. The answer is direct and unambiguous.

        it actually indicates Elmont (~35,000-40,000) appears to be "similar or slightly
        larger" than Oakton (~35,000). Since it notes a potential difference rather
        than exact equality, and this slight difference appears to be part of the
        reasoning for the NO answer, this doesn't qualify as a NO due to equal values

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a difference in values (35,000 vs 34,000) and concludes NO because
        Elmont is larger than Oakton, not because they are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that "Elmont has a larger population

        states that "Elmont is slightly larger than Oakton" and uses this difference
        (not equality) as the reason for its NO answer. Any stated difference, even
        if small, means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Elmont is slightly larger than Oakton, directly answering whether Elmont
        is less populous than Oakton.

        a difference (even if slight), this is not a case of equal values being the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether Elmont is less populous

        more populous." Since it identified a difference (even if small), rather than
        equality, this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" to whether

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing

        in size," it explicitly states different values (35,000 vs 37,000) and notes
        that "Elmont has slightly fewer people." The model does not claim the values
        are exactly equal, and the similarity in size is not given as the primary
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that Elmont (35,000) is not less populous than
        Oakton (37,000). While there appears to be a logical error in the explanation
        (since 35,000 IS less than 37,000), we must take the explicit NO answer at
        face value per instructions.
