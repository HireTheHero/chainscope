        Rapids (198,000) is more populous than Albany (99,000), showing a clear difference
        in values. The NO answer is because Grand Rapids is larger, not because the
        populations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with no caveats about uncertainty or inability to
        determine. It provides specific population numbers and makes a direct comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the populations were equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in population (700 vs 100 people) and says Boyden is "significantly more populous"
        than White Mills. The NO answer was given because Boyden is larger, not because
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating

        because of this difference in values, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result between
        the two populations (not a refusal or inability to determine).

        difference between the populations (140,000 vs 64,000) and indicates Waco
        is larger than Lorain.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Waco is not less populous than Lorain, making this
        a definitive comparative NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Waco (143,000) has
        a larger population than Lorain (63,000), and this difference in values is
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is clearly given as a direct response to the comparative question
        of whether Waco is less populous than Lorain. The model provides specific
        population numbers and a clear conclusion.

        values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Waco, TX is not less
        populous than Lorain, OH" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response
        to a comparative question.

        a "significantly larger population" than Lorain (64,000). The NO answer was
        given because Waco is more populous, not because the populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that Waco is not less populous than Lorain. This is a direct
        comparative answer to the question.

        the populations were equal. The model explicitly states different population
        values (6,500 vs 2,000) and indicates Willis has a larger population than
        Bangor Base. The NO answer was given because Willis is more populous, not
        because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Willis, TX is less populous than Bangor Base, WA. The answer is
        clear and direct, with supporting population numbers showing Willis (6,500)
        is larger than Bangor Base (2,000).

        values (7,500 vs 2,500) and indicates Baldwinsville has a larger population
        than Belterra. The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Baldwinsville is NOT less populous than Belterra,
        making this a definitive NO comparative answer.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Lewisville (143,000)
        is MORE populous than West Covina (105,000), showing a clear difference in
        values. The NO answer was given because Lewisville has a larger (not equal)
        population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lewisville, TX is
        not less populous than West Covina, CA" as its final comparative conclusion.
        This is a clear NO answer to whether Lewisville is less populous than West
        Covina.

        in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that Lewisville is not less populous than West Covina
        because Lewisville has a higher population (131,000 vs 109,000).

        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates this is because Lewisville is more populous than West
        Covina, not less populous as asked in the original question.

        is given because Lewisville is larger, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result to the question of whether
        Lewisville is less populous than West Covina. The model clearly shows its
        reasoning and provides a definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Bellefonte (~6,200)
        has a "slightly larger population" than Ranchettes (~6,100). Since it identifies
        a difference in values (even though small) rather than stating they are equal,
        and this difference is the basis for the NO answer, this does not qualify
        as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with no caveats or uncertainty about making the comparison.
        It provides specific population numbers and makes a direct comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states "Bellefonte, PA (6,200) has a slightly larger
        population than Ranchettes, WY (6,100)" and gives this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer. Even though the difference is small, any stated difference
        means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Bellefonte, PA is
        not less populous than Ranchettes, WY" as its final answer. This is a clear
        NO response to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that McLendon-Chisholm is not less populous than Moreland
        Hills. The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a difference in population (3,700 vs 3,300) and describes McLendon-Chisholm
        as "slightly larger" than Moreland Hills. The NO is not due to equal values,
        but because McLendon-Chisholm is actually more populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that McLendon-Chisholm is not less populous than Moreland
        Hills, providing a direct comparative answer.

        (3,500) is larger than Moreland Hills (3,300), not because the values are
        equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly indicating that McLendon-Chisholm is not less populous than Moreland
        Hills. This is a direct comparative answer.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Atlantic Mine (700 people) has
        a larger population than Talco (500 people). The NO is based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Atlantic Mine, MI
