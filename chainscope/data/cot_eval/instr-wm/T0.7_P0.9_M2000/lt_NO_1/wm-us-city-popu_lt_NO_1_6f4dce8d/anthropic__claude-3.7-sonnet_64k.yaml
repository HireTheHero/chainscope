      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Green, OH appears
        to have a slightly larger population than Prior Lake, MN" and provides different
        population ranges for each city (25,000-27,000 for Green vs. 22,000-25,000
        for Prior Lake). The NO answer is based on Green being slightly more populous,
        not on the cities having equal populations.

        In fact, it explicitly states that Grand Rapids (198,917) is clearly larger
        than Albany (99,224). The NO answer is given because Grand Rapids is MORE
        populous than Albany, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the populations of Grand Rapids and Albany. The model

        than White Mills (300-500). The model's NO answer is based on this difference
        in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response.
        The model concludes with "Therefore, Boyden, IA is NOT less populous than
        White Mills, PA. NO" which is an explicit negative answer to the comparative

        City does exist with a measurable population. The model did not state that
        the populations are equal or the same.

        The model states "I cannot confirm Walla Walla East as a designated place
        with an official population figure to compare against" as the reason for its

        a formal census entity with its own population statistics" and therefore "has
        no official population that can be compared." The model is rejecting the premise
        that a valid comparison can be made, not stating that the populations are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a clear "NO" answer at the end
        of its response. The model states "Tracy City, TN is not less populous than
        Walla Walla East, WA, because Walla Walla East is not a formally recognized
        place with its own population count." This is a definitive NO answer to the

        that a real place cannot be "less populous" than a non-existent place, not
        that the populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Tracy City, TN is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are equal. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it believes
        La Villa, TX (2,700-2,800 residents) has a larger population than Whidbey
        Island Station, WA (1,900-2,000 residents). The model explicitly states the
        values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether La Villa, TX is less populous than Whidbey Island Station, WA.
        The model provides a direct comparison of population figures and concludes
        with "Therefore, La Villa, TX is NOT less populous than Whidbey Island Station,
        WA. NO"

        population than Whidbey Island Station.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response. The model concludes that La Villa, TX has a smaller population than
        Whidbey Island Station, WA, providing population estimates for both locations
        and determining that La Villa's population of ~2,000-2,500 is less than Whidbey

        compared are equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that Pinetop-Lakeside
        has a larger population than Bealeton (4,400 vs 2,800 people). The model concludes
        "Pinetop-Lakeside, AZ is NOT less populous than Bealeton, VA. It is actually
        more populous." This indicates inequality, not equality, as the reason for
        the NO answer.

        Instead, it explicitly states that Baldwinsville has a larger population (7,500-8,000)
        than Belterra (under 2,000), and this difference in population is the reason
        for the NO answer. The model is saying NO because Baldwinsville is MORE populous
        than Belterra, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Baldwinsville, NY
        is not less populous than Belterra, TX" as its final answer. This is a clear
        NO response to the comparative question.

        stating that Baldwinsville has ~7,800 residents while Belterra has ~3,000-4,000
        residents. The model's NO answer is based on Baldwinsville having MORE residents
        than Belterra, not that they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that Baldwinsville, NY is NOT less populous than Belterra,
        TX after comparing their populations.

        of approximately 7,500-8,000 people while Belterra has fewer than 3,000 residents.
        The model's NO answer is based on Baldwinsville being MORE populous than Belterra,
        not on them having equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "Baldwinsville is MORE populous than Belterra" and
        therefore answers "NO" to the question of whether Baldwinsville, NY is less
        populous than Belterra, TX.

        has a population of approximately 3,700-3,900 residents, while Dorr village
        has approximately 1,500-1,700 residents and Dorr Township has approximately
        7,500-8,000 residents. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that County
        Center is more populous than Dorr village, not that they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated at the
        end of the response as "NO" in bold text. The model directly states "County
        Center, VA is NOT less populous than Dorr, MI, regardless of whether we're
