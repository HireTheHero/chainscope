        In fact, it explicitly states that the areas are different, with Yunnan being
        much larger (394,000 square kilometers) than Wagoner County (1,000 square
        kilometers). The model says "Since 394,000 is much larger than 1,000, we can
        conclude that Yunnan has a larger area than Wagoner County." This inequality
        is the reason for the NO answer.
