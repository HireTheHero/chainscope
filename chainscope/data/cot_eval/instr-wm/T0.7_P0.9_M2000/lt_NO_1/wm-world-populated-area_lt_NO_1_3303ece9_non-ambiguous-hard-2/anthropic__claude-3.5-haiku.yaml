      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Does Department of Loreto have smaller area than San Marzano

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values

        that Yunnan (394,000 sq km) is MUCH LARGER than Wagoner County (1,396 sq km).
        The model explicitly states this difference in size as the reason for its

        County (394,000 sq km vs 1,358 sq km, with Yunnan being about 290 times larger).
        The NO answer is given because Yunnan is larger, not because the areas are
