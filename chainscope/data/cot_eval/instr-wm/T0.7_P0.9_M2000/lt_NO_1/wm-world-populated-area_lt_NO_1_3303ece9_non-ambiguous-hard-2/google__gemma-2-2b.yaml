      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        indicating that "Department of Loreto has a smaller area than San Marzano

        instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" because it lacks information about the areas of the
        two locations. This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to
        insufficient information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
