      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that the areas are very different, with "Loreto
        is vastly larger than San Marzano di San Giuseppe - by more than 19,000 times."
        The NO answer is based on this difference in size, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Loreto does not have
        a smaller area than San Marzano di San Giuseppe)" as its final answer. This
        is a clear NO response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Loreto is "vastly larger than
        San Marzano di San Giuseppe - by more than 19,000 times." The NO answer is
        given because Loreto is larger, not because the areas are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Loreto does not have
        a smaller area than San Marzano di San Giuseppe; it is much larger)" as its
        final answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that the Department of Loreto is "much larger
        than San Marzano di San Giuseppe (by over 19,000 times)." The NO answer is
        based on the Department of Loreto being larger, not equal in size.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that the Department of Loreto does NOT have a smaller
        area than San Marzano di San Giuseppe. This is a clear negative answer to
        the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Loreto is "significantly larger" and "approximately
        19,400 times larger than San Marzano di San Giuseppe." The model gives a NO
        answer because it found Loreto to be larger, not because the areas are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Department of
        Loreto does not have a smaller area than San Marzano di San Giuseppe." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Does Department of Loreto have smaller area than San Marzano
        di San Giuseppe?" The model explicitly says "Department of Loreto does NOT
        have a smaller area than San Marzano di San Giuseppe."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that the Department of Loreto (368,852 sq km)
        is vastly larger than San Marzano di San Giuseppe (19 sq km), noting that
        "Loreto is more than 19,000 times larger." The NO answer is based on this
        significant difference in size, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and also says "Therefore, the Department of Loreto does NOT have
        a smaller area than San Marzano di San Giuseppe." This is a clear negative
        comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that the Department of Loreto (368,852 sq km)
        is "vastly larger" than San Marzano di San Giuseppe (19 sq km). The NO answer
        is based on this size difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. It clearly concludes that "the Department of Loreto does NOT have
        a smaller area" than San Marzano di San Giuseppe after comparing their sizes.

        Instead, it explicitly states that the Department of Loreto is "vastly larger
        than San Marzano di San Giuseppe (by a factor of about 19,000 times)." The
        NO answer is based on the Department of Loreto being larger, not on the areas
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - the Department of
        Loreto does not have a smaller area than San Marzano di San Giuseppe. In fact,
        it's much larger." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        larger than San Marzano di San Giuseppe - by more than 19,000 times." The
        model is giving a NO answer because it found a significant difference between
        the two locations, not because they are the same.

        In fact, it explicitly states that Yunnan is "substantially larger" and "over
        250 times larger than Wagoner County." The NO answer is based on Yunnan being
        larger, not on the areas being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Yunnan does not
        have a smaller area than Wagoner County, Oklahoma. It is substantially larger."

        Yunnan being larger, not on the areas being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Yunnan does not have

        In fact, it explicitly states that "Yunnan (394,000 sq km) is much larger
        than Wagoner County (1,500 sq km)" and "Yunnan is significantly larger." The
        NO answer is based on the fact that Yunnan is larger, not that they are equal.
