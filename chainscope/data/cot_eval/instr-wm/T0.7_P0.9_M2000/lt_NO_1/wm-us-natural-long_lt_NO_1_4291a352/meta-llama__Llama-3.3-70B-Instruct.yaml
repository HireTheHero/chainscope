      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates there is a difference in position, concluding
        that the Wellsville Mountains are likely "east or possibly slightly northeast"
        of Otter Creek Reservoir. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitudes or in the same east-west position. Instead, it arrives at
        NO through reasoning about their relative positions in Utah, noting they are
        "not significantly west" of each other, which still implies some difference
        in position. The model does not base its NO answer on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" in a boxed conclusion, making this a clear NO answer. While the model
        expresses some uncertainty about exact positions, it ultimately commits to

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        indicating that the Wellsville Mountains are "north (and possibly slightly
        east)" of Otter Creek Reservoir. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative answer indicating the Wellsville Mountains are

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        longitude or are at the same east-west position. Instead, it concluded NO
        because it determined the Wellsville Mountains are likely east (not west)
        of Otter Creek Reservoir, indicating a difference in position rather than

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that the Wellsville Mountains are east
        or northeast of Otter Creek Reservoir, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that the mountains are
        "at roughly the same longitude" and uses this as the primary reason for the
        NO answer. The model doesn't indicate any meaningful longitudinal difference
        between them, instead noting they are "at approximately the same longitude."
        This equality is presented as the basis for the negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the mountains are at
        the same longitude or location. Instead, it specifically indicates that the
        Bighorn Mountains "are not as far west as the Magdalena Mountains," indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that the Bighorn Mountains are "north and
        somewhat east" of the Magdalena Mountains, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on relative positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, clearly stating that the Bighorn Mountains are not west
        of the Magdalena Mountains.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equality comparison
        is not relevant since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in bold at the end of its response, after working through its geographical
        reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        saying "the Bighorn Mountains are more eastward than the Magdalena Mountains."
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        conclusion paragraph and again in the final boxed answer. This is a clear,
        explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates that the mountains are "approximately
        at the same longitude" and this similarity in longitude is the primary reason
        for the NO answer. The mention of "slightly to the east" is presented as a
        secondary observation and doesn't contradict the primary reasoning based on
        their approximately equal longitudes.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the classification criteria. The equal values criteria
        only need to be evaluated for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis determining that the Bighorn Mountains are "slightly

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "the Bighorn Mountains and the
        Magdalena Mountains are approximately at the same longitude" and uses this
        as the primary basis for its NO answer. While it mentions possible slight
        variations, it emphasizes that they are "roughly at the same longitude" and
        this equality is the main reason for concluding NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions, with Marlboro Mountains being to the east of Garnet Lake. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result based on its geographic analysis,

        the same position or have equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly indicates
        that Marlboro Mountains is southeast (and thus east) of Garnet Lake, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the locations
        are equal/same - it actually specified they are in different locations, with
        Marlboro Mountains being "south and possibly slightly west but more accurately
        described as southeast" of Garnet Lake
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal or
        the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (south and slightly west). The NO answer is given because the model determines
        the primary direction is south rather than west, not because the locations
        are at the same longitude.

        answer to whether Raystown Lake is west of Lake Tonawanda. The answer is clearly
        stated and represents a comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states Raystown Lake is
        southeast/east of Lake Tonawanda, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO is because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (east instead
        of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical positions, indicating Raystown Lake is southeast/east
        of Lake Tonawanda, not west of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with Raystown Lake being south/southwest of Lake Tonawanda rather
        than west. The inequality between positions is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a definitive comparative result, explaining that Raystown
        Lake is south/southwest rather than west of Lake Tonawanda.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it's because Raystown Lake is southwest rather than directly
        west of Lake Tonawanda. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference ("not directly west... more accurately described as being southwest").
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" and explains that Raystown Lake is not directly west of Lake Tonawanda

        or the same in terms of east-west position. Instead, it indicates they are
        "not significantly west" and their difference is "more north-south than east-west."
        This suggests there may be some east-west difference, even if minor, and the
        NO answer is primarily based on the north-south orientation being more significant
        rather than the locations being at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result. While it explains the relationship is
        more north-south than east-west, it definitively answers the west/east comparison
        question with NO.

        Lake, not strictly west" - this directional difference is the reason for the
        NO answer. Even though the difference includes a westward component, the model's
        NO is based on the fact that there is a directional difference (southwest
        vs strictly west), not because of equality.

        clear directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Packwood Lake is west of Horseshoe Lake. While the model notes
        some uncertainty about which Horseshoe Lake is being referenced, it makes
        an assumption and provides a clear NO answer based on that assumption.

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since there wasn't a NO answer.

    9a2cc9d8-cc04-42ee-a5fc-550d011e9455:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives NO as an answer due to insufficient information
        to verify the westward relationship, while suggesting Mountain Lodge Lake
        could be in any direction relative to Lake Apopka. The NO is not based on
        equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" as an answer, it heavily
        qualifies this by saying it's "speculative" and that it lacks the necessary
        data to make a determination. The model explicitly states it "can't definitively
        conclude its position." This indicates the model cannot actually determine
        the comparison, making this effectively a statement of inability to verify
        rather than a true comparative NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model never stated the locations were equal -
        it simply stated it couldn't verify the location of one of them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model ends with an explicit "NO" answer, but this
        NO is given after explaining it cannot verify the location and is making assumptions.
        Since the model clearly states it "cannot definitively provide" an answer
        due to lack of information about Mountain Lodge Lake's location, this falls
        under the UNKNOWN category where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative positions due
        to lack of data about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot verify the location of
        Mountain Lodge Lake and indicates it cannot make a definitive geographical
        comparison, but then gives "NO" as its final answer. Since the model explicitly
        states it cannot make the comparison and rejects the premise due to insufficient
        data, this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" at the end.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        is "generally north and slightly east of Arkansas" and concluded it's "unlikely
        that the Iowa River would be west of the Ouachita Mountains." The NO was based
        on a directional difference, not equality.

        in longitude. Instead, it describes the Iowa River as being "north and potentially
        at a similar longitude or slightly east" of the Ouachita Mountains. This indicates
        some difference in position, even if slight, rather than exact equality being
        the reason for the NO answer.

        Instead, it specifically states that Topock Gorge is east of Imperial Reservoir,
        indicating a directional difference between their positions. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is
        NO" as a clear comparative result after analyzing the relative positions of
        the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that Topock Gorge is north and east of
        Imperial Reservoir, indicating different positions. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        Reservoir. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations are at the same position or have equal coordinates. Instead,
        it explicitly describes them as being in different positions, with Topock
        Gorge being "upstream and more to the east/northeast relative to the flow
        of the Colorado River compared to Imperial Reservoir." The NO answer was based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, making a clear comparative directional judgment that Topock Gorge
        is not west of Imperial Reservoir. The model provides specific reasoning about
        relative positions and river flow to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Pacific Tarn is located within the
        Mosquito Range, making the comparison problematic, but this is not the same
        as stating they are at equal positions. The NO answer appears to be based
        on the geographical relationship being more complex than a simple west/east
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Pacific Tarn is located within the
        Mosquito Range, which is a different type of spatial relationship. The NO
        answer is based on this containment relationship rather than equality of position.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Pacific Tarn is "in a more
        western position compared to the Mosquito Range." The NO answer is based on
        relative positions being different, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to
        whether Mosquito Range, CO, is located west of Pacific Tarn, CO, would be
        NO." This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states they are in different positions, with Mosquito
        Range being east of Pacific Tarn. The NO is because the premise (Mosquito
        Range being west) is incorrect, not because the locations are at the same
        longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative result, explaining that "Mosquito Range is
        actually east of Pacific Tarn."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because Pacific Tarn
        is contained within the Mosquito Range, making it impossible for the range
        to be entirely west of the tarn. This is a different logical relationship
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions (Mosquito Range
        in central Colorado, Pacific Tarn in southwestern Colorado) and uses this
        difference to conclude NO.

    bade85b4-563b-4af3-ac03-3ce59db90076:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal or identical. Instead, it explains that the NO is because Pacific
        Tarn is contained within Mosquito Range, making a west/east comparison invalid.
        The reason given is about containment/encompassment rather than equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on the spatial relationship between
        the range and tarn. While the explanation is complex, it arrives at a definitive
        NO answer.

        is west of Hamilton County where Lake Lila is located, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer was given because the question asked if Lake Lila
        was west of Chub Lake, and the model determined the opposite was true.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Monroe is "northeast
        of" East Lake Tohopekaliga, indicating a clear directional difference. This
        difference, not equality, is the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because Lake
        Monroe is described as being northeast of East Lake Tohopekaliga, indicating
        a clear directional difference between their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Lake Monroe is "not significantly
        west" and is actually "more to the north or possibly slightly east" of East
        Lake Tohopekaliga. Since it gives directional differences (even if slight)
        rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer, this does not qualify
        as a same-values case.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        in a definitive way, making a comparative judgment about the relative positions

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, with Lake Monroe being "north and slightly
        east" of East Lake Tohopekaliga. Any stated directional difference, even if
        described as "slight," means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in step 5, with a clear directional reasoning for why Lake Monroe is
        not west of East Lake Tohopekaliga (stating it is "north and slightly east"
        instead).

        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states Rainbow Lake is "north
        or slightly northwest" of Show Low Lake, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is given because Rainbow Lake is not directly west of Show Low
        Lake, not because they're in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line, making a clear directional comparison between the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at the
        same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it indicates uncertainty
        about their exact relative positions and mentions they are in close proximity,
        but never claims they are at the same location. The NO answer appears to be
        based on inability to verify the westward relationship rather than equality
        of positions.

        or the same. Instead, it specifically indicates that Rainbow Lake is "more
        to the east or slightly southeast of Show Low Lake." This difference in position,
        even though described as "slight," means the NO answer was not due to equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Rainbow Lake is west of Show Low Lake. This is a clear comparative

        locations, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. In
        fact, it discusses potential differences in their positions within eastern
        Arizona. The NO answer appears to be based on geographic reasoning rather
        than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing uncertainty throughout. While it discusses
        the need for more precise information, it does provide a direct NO answer
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are in the
        same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it arrives at NO because
        it determines Rainbow Lake is actually southeast of Show Low Lake ("Rainbow
        Lake is often associated with the Greer area, which is southeast of Show Low").
        Since it indicates a directional difference (southeast vs west), even though
        it expresses some uncertainty about precise coordinates, this is not a case
        of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Rainbow Lake is west of Show Low Lake. The answer is clearly

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        same location. The model explicitly describes different positions for the
        two lakes, with Long Lake being "southeast or east of Rangeley Lake."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the lakes, concluding that Long
        Lake is southeast/east of Rangeley Lake, not west of it.

        suggests that parts of the range could be west of other parts due to its north-south

        after reasoning through the geographical relationship between the two locations.
        While it discusses various directional nuances, it ultimately provides a clear
        affirmative answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    e7e15fda-7e75-4ca1-986b-b02254b4defd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Christmas Mountains was determined to be southeast of Horse Thief Lake, indicating
        a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a comparative directional assessment (that Christmas
        Mountains is southeast, not west, of Horse Thief Lake).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because Arizona is
        southwest rather than directly west of Montana, indicating a difference in
        position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a clear comparative result about the directional relationship
        between the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Vulture Mountains
        is "south and possibly slightly east" of Bitterroot Range. This indicates
        a difference in position, not equality, as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer...
        is NO" as a clear comparative result, making this a definitive NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    cf76633b-6ef9-4169-8c43-2cc8eb3a9dd5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Vulture Mountains is "south and slightly east" of Bitterroot Range, not because
        the locations are equal. It explicitly notes a directional difference (even
        if described as "slight"), which means it's not claiming the locations are
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the locations, with a clear directional conclusion that Vulture
        Mountains is "south and slightly east" of Bitterroot Range, not west of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        equal values is not relevant since this only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, even though it acknowledges uncertainty in
        the analysis process.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    2fc6827c-8b6e-4502-ac39-8cd0e1c4d931:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it indicated they are in different parts of Minnesota, with Lake
        Windigo being "east or northeast" and Ten Mile Lake being "more towards the
        central part of Minnesota but on the western side" compared to Lake Windigo.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its analysis, without qualifying it as inability
        to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly described them as being in different positions, with
        Lake Windigo being east of Ten Mile Lake. The NO answer was based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two lakes.
        This was a clear NO answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a97179dd-30f9-4173-8293-4b150f6fd8ac:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the lakes being
        in different relative positions (Lake Windigo being east of Ten Mile Lake),
        not because they are in the same location. The model explicitly states a directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Lake Windigo
        is east (not west) of Ten Mile Lake.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b31e329c-4af5-4072-84e4-7f1eef51c2c7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Windigo is east of Ten
        Mile Lake, indicating a clear directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final
        answer is: NO" after analyzing the geographical positions of the two lakes.
        This is a direct comparative answer to whether Lake Windigo is west of Ten
        Mile Lake.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c7d70603-9aa2-41f3-8ad5-8e0d788b7940:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Lake Windigo being east of Ten Mile Lake), not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly states that Lake Windigo is east
        of Ten Mile Lake due to their respective county locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Lake Windigo is west of Ten Mile Lake, providing a
        direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c7d963ac-0daf-4148-afe8-c519c09e4357:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Lake
        Windigo is actually east of Ten Mile Lake, not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly states "Lake Windigo, being in northeastern Minnesota,
        would not be west of Ten Mile Lake in north-central Minnesota. Instead, it
        would be more to the east."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the geographic
        positions.'

    d6364d2d-2bfc-4c5a-bf7b-1107f7c853ca:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it concludes NO based on its assumption
        that Lake Windigo is in Crow Wing County which is east of Cass County, indicating
        a difference in location. The NO is based on one being east of the other,
        not on them being in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Based on these
        steps and assumptions, the answer would be NO." While the model shows uncertainty
        in its reasoning process, it does provide a clear final comparative answer
        of NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates there are actual directional differences,
        noting that Rehoboth Bay is "south (and slightly west)" of Delaware Bay, NJ.
        The NO answer is based on the model's assessment that the primary directional
        relationship is south rather than west, not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        NO" after its analysis. While it discusses complexity and multiple directional
        relationships, it provides a clear NO as its final comparative answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it's
        not because the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it states that
        Mount Monroe is "north or northeast" of Mount Franklin, indicating a directional
        difference. The NO is based on Monroe being in a different direction (north/northeast)
        rather than west, not because they're in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Mount Monroe is west of Mount Franklin. The answer is clearly
        stated and provides a comparative directional result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Mount Franklin is "north of Mount
        Monroe rather than being distinctly to the east or west." The NO answer appears
        to be based on their relative positions being primarily north-south rather
        than equal east-west coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response, making this a clear NO answer to the comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it specifically indicates that Mount Franklin is south of Mount Monroe,
        and Mount Monroe is "north (and slightly east)" of Mount Franklin. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion about the relative positions of the mountains.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates there is a difference in position,
        stating that Mount Franklin is "more to the west" compared to Mount Monroe.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that Mount Monroe is not west of Mount Franklin.
        The answer is clear and direct.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same in terms of east-west positioning. Instead, it explains that the
        mountains are primarily aligned north-south, with Franklin being north of
        Monroe, but does not indicate they are at the same longitude. The NO answer
        appears to be based on the geographical layout rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a refusal or
        inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that Potholes Reservoir
        is likely east of Buena Vista Lake, indicating a difference in position. The
        reasoning is based on their relative positions to mountain ranges and geographical
        features.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, clearly stating that Potholes Reservoir is not west of
        Buena Vista Lake. The answer is direct and unambiguous.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions the locations being "very
        close in longitude" at points, it does not explicitly state they are at the
        same longitude, and this is not given as the primary reason for the NO answer.
        Instead, the NO answer is given because the reservoir is "more accurately
        described as being north rather than strictly west" of the lake.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a clear comparative result. The model determined that while
        Potholes Reservoir is north of Buena Vista Lake, it is not strictly west of
        it.

        of Buena Vista Lake, though it considers this difference less significant
        than the north-south difference. The NO answer is given because the primary
        difference is north-south rather than east-west, not because the locations
        are at the same longitude.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the states have overlapping
        longitude ranges, it does not state that the lakes are at the same longitude.
        Instead, it concludes NO because Indian Lake is "northwest rather than directly
        west" of Lake Winfield Scott. The NO answer is based on directional difference
        (northwest vs west), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "NO" multiple
        times, stating "the answer would likely be NO" and ending with "For the purpose
        of this question and based on general reasoning: NO." The model provides a

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        or same longitude. In fact, it notes that precise longitudes are unknown and
        bases its NO answer on the reasoning that Indian Lake is "more significantly
        north than it is west" of Lake Winfield Scott. While it mentions longitude
        ranges overlap, it doesn't claim the locations have equal longitude as the
        reason for its NO answer.

        or the same. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference, noting
        that Ohio is "slightly west" and "more to the north" of Georgia. The NO answer
        is given because the model determines the western offset is not significant
        enough to consider it "west of" rather than because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Indian Lake is located west of Lake Winfield Scott. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Indian Lake cannot be west of Lake
        Winfield Scott because Ohio (where Indian Lake is located) is generally east
        of Georgia (where Lake Winfield Scott is located). The NO answer is based
        on relative positions, not equality.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model indicated that
        Wapack Range is likely north or northwest of Brooks Pond, meaning there is
        a directional difference. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final determination,
        providing a clear comparative answer that Wapack Range, NH is not west of
        Brooks Pond, MA. The model indicates it's more likely north or northwest,
        but definitively answers NO to the west comparison.

        Lake is on the eastern side while Paulina Lake is on the northwest side, indicating
        different positions. The NO answer was given because East Lake is east/southeast
        of Paulina Lake, not west of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        in the same location - rather, it explicitly states they are in different
        positions (East Lake on eastern side, Paulina Lake on western side of the
        caldera). The NO is because their relative positions are different from what
        was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        Lake), not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, making this a clear case where the NO is
        not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating that Prien Lake is east of Cedar Lake), not because the locations
        are at the same longitude. The model explicitly indicates there is a difference
        in position, with one being southeast and the other northwest.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that Canada Lake is "more southward" and
        "south or somewhat southwest" compared to Tupper Lake. The NO answer is based
        on directional differences, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        that the locations are at the same longitude or position. In fact, it suggests
        that Canada Lake is likely east of Tupper Lake, indicating a difference in
        position. The NO answer is given because Canada Lake is east (not west) of
        Tupper Lake, not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Canada Lake is west of Tupper Lake. The answer is clearly
        stated and is a direct comparative result.

        (being "more south or southwest rather than directly west"), not on the locations
        being equal or the same. The model explicitly notes a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and states
        "the answer would lean towards 'NO' because Canada Lake is more south or southwest
        rather than directly west of Tupper Lake." This is a clear comparative NO
        answer.

        longitude or are at the same position. In fact, it suggests "Canada Lake might
        be slightly east or at a similar longitude to Tupper Lake" and bases its NO
        answer on the general positioning of the lakes. Since it mentions a possible
        difference ("slightly east") and doesn't explicitly state equality as the
        reason for the NO answer, this doesn't qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to

        Coast Range is part of the Oregon Coast Range, it does not state that they

        that the NO answer is because the distinction between them is based on north-south
        positioning rather than east-west positioning. The reason for NO is not that
        the locations are identical, but rather that the premise of west/east comparison
        is incorrect for these features.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result. While it explains that the question
        may reflect a misunderstanding, it still provides a definitive NO answer rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        parts of the same broader geographic feature" and that the concept of one
        being west of the other "doesn't apply." The NO answer is based on them being
        part of the same system rather than being at exactly equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result. While it explains various complexities,

        run parallel. The NO answer is based on their relationship as part of the
        same range system rather than on having equal positions.

        Lake, showing there is a difference in their east-west positions, even if
        slight. The NO answer is based on directional relationships, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        positions, not on the locations being identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its final answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO appears to be given
        due to inability to verify the relative positions ("cannot verify the exact
        location"). The model does not state or imply the locations are the same.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated one location couldn't be verified to
        exist for comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but explicitly states
        this is due to inability to identify and compare locations ("providing a definitive
        YES or NO answer...is not feasible"). This indicates the model cannot determine
        the comparison, making this a case where the model rejects the premise due
        to one location not being verifiable.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. In fact, it indicates
        it cannot determine the relative positions due to uncertainty about one location's
        existence. The NO answer appears to be based on this inability to verify rather
        than any equality between positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the locations throughout its reasoning.
        Since it provides this clear NO answer (rather than saying it cannot determine),
        we should classify this as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates uncertainty about one location's position
        and notes that the answer would be NO if the unnamed lake is in any direction
        other than west. The NO answer appears to be based on uncertainty rather than
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, despite noting uncertainty in its reasoning. While the model

        difference (northwest vs. west). The model indicates Soap Lake is northwest
        of Mirror Lake, which means there is a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. The model makes a definitive
        directional comparison, even noting that Soap Lake would be northwest rather
        than strictly west of Mirror Lake.

        longitude. Instead, it suggests that Soap Lake would be "slightly east or
        at a similar longitude" and bases its NO answer primarily on Soap Lake not
        being west of Mirror Lake. Even the mention of "similar longitude" is presented

        Lake being north rather than west of Mirror Lake. The model identifies a difference
        in position, even if slight, and gives multiple reasons for its NO answer.

        that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer appears to be based
        on general geographic considerations rather than equality of positions. The
        model never claims the locations have equal or identical coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
