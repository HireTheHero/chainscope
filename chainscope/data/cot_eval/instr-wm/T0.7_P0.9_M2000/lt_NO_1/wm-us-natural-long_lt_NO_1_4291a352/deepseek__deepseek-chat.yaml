      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. Rather, the NO was given because the
        Wellsville Mountains are northwest rather than directly west of the reservoir,
        indicating a directional difference. The model explicitly notes this difference
        in relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the Wellsville Mountains are northwest rather than directly west of Otter
        Creek Reservoir.

        difference in position, not on equality of values. Any difference, even if
        described as slight, means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it both in the conclusion and as a final bolded statement.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result (because the Bighorns are
        east of the Magdalenas, not west).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the ranges

        similar longitudinal lines," it explicitly states that the Magdalena Mountains
        are "slightly farther west" and that the Bighorn Mountains are "slightly east

        (even if slight), this is not a case of equal values being the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that the locations are different, with Marlboro Mountains
        being southwest of Garnet Lake. The NO is because the direction is southwest
        rather than purely west, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Marlboro Mountains are not located
        west of Garnet Lake (specifically stating they are southwest instead).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (that Marlboro Mountains are southwest of Garnet Lake, not west).
        The NO is based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a difference in position, saying Marlboro Mountains is "significantly
        farther south and east compared to Garnet Lake." The NO answer was given because
        one location is east of the other, not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different positions,
        with Packwood Lake being "further east" and Horseshoe Lake being "further
        west". The NO is based on Packwood Lake being east of Horseshoe Lake, not
        on them being in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that Packwood Lake is not
        west of Horseshoe Lake. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

        Horseshoe Lake is "further west"). The NO is not due to the locations being
        equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Packwood Lake is east of
        Horseshoe Lake, not west of it.

        at the same location - it explicitly states that Onondaga Lake is east of
        Otisco Lake, indicating a difference in position. The NO is because the relationship
        is opposite to what was asked (east rather than west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        is northeast of Lake Oscawana, not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model explicitly states a directional difference (northeast vs west),
        so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" after

        was given because Dix Range cannot be west of Lake Oscawana since it's northeast
        of it.

        (stating that Dix Range is northwest/north of Lake Oscawana, not west), not
        on the locations being equal or the same. The model explicitly notes a difference
        in relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" and

        relationship than what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that Rehoboth Bay is
        south of Delaware Bay, not west. The NO is based on a different directional
        relationship (south) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        a directional difference between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Rehoboth
        Bay is located south of Delaware Bay, indicating a different relative position.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it both in the conclusion and as a final bolded answer.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result (not being west of), not as
        an inability to determine.

        The NO answer is based on Rehoboth Bay being south rather than west of Delaware
        Bay.

        but this is not the same as stating they are at equal longitude. The NO answer
        is based on their relative positions, not on them being at the same longitude.

        Range is a part/subset of the Oregon Coast Range, which is a different type
        of relationship than equality. The NO is based on the impossibility of a subset
        being west of its containing set.

        type of relationship than equality. The reason for NO is about containment
        rather than equality.

        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed when
        the answer isn't NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Boundary Pass cannot be
        west of Henry Hagg Lake because it is north of it. The model identifies a
        clear directional difference between the locations.
