      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same longitude. The model explicitly states that
        the Marlboro Mountains are at a "lower longitude (further east)" compared
        to Garnet Lake, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was given

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that the Marlboro Mountains are
        southwest of Garnet Lake, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer
        appears to be given because the location is southwest rather than purely west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or position. Instead, it determines NO based on their relative
        positions being different (with Horseshoe Lake being west of Packwood Lake).
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" after
        determining that Packwood Lake is not west of Horseshoe Lake. This is an explicit

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Packwood
        Lake is east of Horseshoe Lake, not because they are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states a directional difference ("Packwood is situated
        to the east... while Woodland is positioned to the west").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Packwood
        Lake is not located west of Horseshoe Lake" as a clear comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Packwood Lake is east of Horseshoe Lake), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly indicates there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a directional explanation that Packwood

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that "Packwood Lake is located
        to the east of the most relevant Horseshoe Lake." The NO answer is based on
        a directional difference (east vs west), not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Packwood Lake is

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different longitude values
        (-121.6461 vs -122.8417) and states NO because Horseshoe Lake is further west
        than Packwood Lake, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Packwood Lake is

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Santa Rosa Range
        is to the northeast/east of Rogers Dry Lake, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, the Santa
        Rosa Range, NV is not located west of Rogers Dry Lake, CA" as its final answer.
        This is a direct comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that the Santa Rosa Range is east of Rogers
        Dry Lake, indicating a clear directional difference between their positions.
        The NO is because their relative positions are opposite to what was asked
        (east rather than west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Santa Rosa Range is west of Rogers Dry Lake, explaining that
        the Santa Rosa Range is east of Rogers Dry Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        saying the Santa Rosa Range is "situated at a higher longitude (further east)"
        compared to Rogers Dry Lake. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Santa Rosa Range is west of Rogers Dry Lake, providing a clear

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that "The Santa Rosa Range's
        western edge is around the same longitude as Rogers Dry Lake," this is not
        explicitly stated as the reason for the NO answer. The statement suggests
        similarity in position but doesn't explicitly state they are exactly equal,
        and it specifically refers only to the "western edge." Therefore, this doesn't
        meet the criteria for a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to
        whether the Santa Rosa Range is located west of Rogers Dry Lake is NO." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        equal longitudes. In fact, it explicitly states that Rogers Dry Lake is "slightly
        further west than the Santa Rosa Range," indicating a difference in position,
        even if small. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Santa Rosa Range
        is not located west of Rogers Dry Lake" as its final answer, providing a clear

        the locations are at the same longitude. The model explicitly states that
        the Santa Rosa Range is positioned at a "higher longitude" and is "east of
        Rogers Dry Lake", indicating a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical
        analysis that the Santa Rosa Range is east of Rogers Dry Lake.

        (Santa Rosa Range being east of Rogers Dry Lake), not because the locations
        are at the same longitude. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        the location rather than a definitive comparative result. The model essentially
        rejects the premise by questioning the existence of one location, making this
        an UNKNOWN response.

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to insufficient information about Mountain Lodge Lake's
        location. This indicates an inability to make the comparison rather than a
        refusal or clear YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions due to insufficient information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is due to insufficient information to make the determination. This is
        effectively stating "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN
        classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model did not give a NO answer
        based on equal values - it gave a response indicating inability to determine
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, I cannot determine the relative
        position" which indicates it cannot make the comparison. This falls under
        the UNKNOWN category since it explicitly states inability to verify/determine
        the comparison.

        locations were equal - it stated it couldn't verify one location's existence
        or position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot make the comparison due
        to lack of verifiable information about Mountain Lodge Lake, and rejects the
        premise by suggesting the location may not exist. Although it ends with "NO",
        this is clearly a case where the model is indicating it cannot determine the
        answer rather than making a comparative judgment.

    9dcc2207-9de5-4ce9-8e89-8d45d364ca74:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that they are at different positions,
        with Rangeley Lake being "further west" and Long Lake being "further east".
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion after comparing the locations, making this an explicit NO
        answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or position. Instead, it indicates that Rangeley Lake is
        west of Long Lake, which represents a difference in position, not equality.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on the locations
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Long Lake (Maine)
        is not located west of Rangeley Lake, ME" as its final comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at the
        same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Rangeley Lake is further west than Long Lake, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" and provides
        a comparative conclusion that Long Lake is not located west of Rangeley Lake.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative positions
        (Long Lake being "further southeast" compared to Rangeley Lake's northwestern
        position), not because the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly
        indicates a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response to whether Long Lake
        is west of Rangeley Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Long Lake being
        "located more towards the south and east relative to Rangeley Lake" - indicating
        a directional difference, not equality. The NO is because one lake is east
        of the other, not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" and explains that Long Lake is east of Rangeley Lake, not west. This is
        an explicit NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on explaining that
        these are not separate entities but rather the same mountain system ("it is
        not a separate or distinct entity" and "it is part of the same mountain system").
        This indicates the NO is due to them being the same thing rather than any
        directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, providing a clear comparative answer based
        on its analysis that one is not west of the other because they are the same

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explains that the Range is a component/part of the Mountains,
        and this relationship is the reason for the NO answer, not because they are
        at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the primary reason given for the NO answer. The model does not indicate any
        directional difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this appears to be a direct comparative answer rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or verify.

        de Cristo Range is a part of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains"). The NO answer
        is based on this part-whole relationship, not on equality of location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Sangre de Cristo
        Range is not located west of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains." The answer is
        clearly NO, and it's given as a comparative result.

        is part of the mountains") and uses this nested relationship, not equality,
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        or the same - instead, it explains that one is actually part of the other
        and is located to the north. The NO answer is based on this different spatial
        relationship, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer when comparing the westward position of these locations.

        the same geographic feature... they are essentially the same and not separate
        entities").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that one is part of the other and lies
        in the eastern section. The NO answer is based on relative positioning, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and

        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that the Range is "situated on
        the eastern side" of the Mountains, indicating a clear directional difference.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion after analyzing the geographical relationship between the
        two locations. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/identical/the
        same. Instead, it explains that one is a subrange of the other and they are
        "part of the same mountain system" - this describes a containment relationship
        rather than equality. The NO answer is based on this relationship making the
        comparison invalid, not because of equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False per the guidelines. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated one location
        couldn't be verified.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, because we cannot confirm its
        position" - this is indicating an inability to determine/verify the comparison
        rather than a comparative result, so this falls under the UNKNOWN category
        per the guidelines. This is similar to Example 3 where the model says "NO,
        I cannot verify."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a comparison of equal values since it couldn't verify one location's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot make a definitive
        YES/NO determination because one of the locations (Crazy Lake) cannot be verified
        to exist or have a specific location. The model rejects the premise by indicating
        one location is not officially recognized.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. The model did not give a NO answer based
        on equal values - it actually indicated it couldn't locate one of the places
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot make the comparison because
        one of the locations (Crazy Lake) cannot be found in geographical databases.
        While it does say "NO", this is explicitly qualified with an inability to
        verify the location, making this a case where the model rejects the premises
        of the question since one location may not exist.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated one location might not exist or be officially
        recognized.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot be answered with a clear
        YES or NO" but then concludes with "NO, because Crazy Lake, CA cannot be confirmed."
        Since this NO is about the ability to determine the relationship rather than
        the comparative relationship itself, and the model questions whether one location
        exists, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one location at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot determine the location
        of Crazy Lake since it may not exist or be officially recognized. While it
        ends with "NO, based on available information," this is effectively stating
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information about one of
        the locations. This falls under the case where the model rejects the premises

        on equal values - it indicated uncertainty about being able to make the comparison
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot make the comparison due
        to Crazy Lake not being widely recognized and needing further information
        to verify. While it ends with "NO", this is effectively stating it cannot
        determine the comparison, making this a case where the model rejects the premises
        (one location may not exist) or indicates it cannot make the determination.

        based on equal values - it expressed inability to make the comparison due
        to uncertainty about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot determine" and indicates
        uncertainty about one location's existence. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification

        based on equal values - it gave a response indicating inability to determine
        the relationship due to lack of location data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot definitively say..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information
        about Crazy Lake's location. This is a case where the model explicitly states

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically indicates that Clear Fork Reservoir
        is "situated to the southeast of Castalia" - indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/identical/the
        same. Instead, it explains that the Northern Oregon Coast Range is a subsection/part
        of the Oregon Coast Range, which is a different type of reasoning for the
        NO answer. While they are related geographically, the model's NO is based
        on the part-whole relationship rather than equality of position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Rather, it explains that one is a segment/part
        of the other, making the comparison invalid. This is a different type of reasoning
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and explains that
        the Northern Oregon Coast Range is not located west of the Oregon Coast Range,

        the other, it does not state that they are equal or the same. Instead, it
        explains that they have a different spatial relationship (one being the northern
        portion of the other) as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as a clear comparative result, explaining that the Northern
        Oregon Coast Range is not west of the Oregon Coast Range but rather is part
        of it and located to the north.

        a subset of the other ("is a part of it"), which is a different type of relationship
        than equality. The NO answer is based on the hierarchical relationship between
        the ranges, not on them being at the same longitude or having equal positions.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/identical. Rather, the NO was because one is a subset
        of the other - the Northern Oregon Coast Range is described as being "part
        of" the larger Oregon Coast Range. This is a different type of relationship
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and
        clearly explains that the Northern Oregon Coast Range is not located west
        of the Oregon Coast Range because it is a part of it.

        the broader Oregon Coast Range and runs parallel to it. The NO answer is based
        on this relationship rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after explaining that the Northern Oregon Coast Range is not located west
        of the Oregon Coast Range because it is part of the same range.

        being equal/identical, but rather because one is a subset of the other ("Northern
        Oregon Coast Range is part of the larger Oregon Coast Range"). The reason
        given is about containment/subset relationship, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/identical. Instead, the reason given was that the
        Northern Oregon Coast Range is a part/section of the larger Oregon Coast Range
        rather than being a separate entity to its west. The model does not state
        that the locations are the same or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and
        provides a clear comparative result, explaining that the Northern Oregon Coast
        Range is not located west of the Oregon Coast Range because it is part of
        the same range.

    afa3f077-744c-4b98-9bbd-9480c75e0d5f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates that Lake Osakis is east of
        West Okoboji Lake, meaning there is a directional difference between their
        positions. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lake Osakis, MN is
        not located west of West Okoboji Lake, IA" as its final comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c3346bde-81fa-462e-926e-be928f04e22e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Lake Osakis is east of West Okoboji
        Lake, indicating a difference in position. The NO is because the premise (Lake
        Osakis being west) is opposite to the actual relative positions the model
        describes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Lake Osakis is west of West Okoboji Lake, providing
        a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: "The model gives NO as its answer, but not because\
        \ the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference\
        \ in longitude (95.1\xB0W vs 95.3\xB0W) and concludes that Lake Osakis is\
        \ \"slightly east\" of West Okoboji Lake. Since it identifies a difference\
        \ in values, even though small, this does not qualify as equal values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and
        confirms "Lake Osakis, MN is not located west of West Okoboji Lake, IA" as
        its final comparative conclusion.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing specific longitude values and a clear directional conclusion
        that Boundary Pass is east of Henry Hagg Lake, not west.
