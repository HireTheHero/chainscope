      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or position. Instead, it indicates that Wellsville Mountains
        are "east or northeast" of Otter Creek Reservoir, giving a directional difference
        as the reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically indicates there is a directional difference,
        stating that Wellsville Mountains are "more to the north and west of the reservoir".
        Since it notes a directional difference, even if describing both a northern
        and western component, this cannot be classified as equal values.

    bcc53472-60c0-4c0a-b3ca-75c9d13b27c3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Wellsville Mountains are north of the reservoir). The NO is given
        because the direction is different from what was asked (north instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating "the answer to the question is NO" because the
        Wellsville Mountains are north of the reservoir rather than west.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that the Wellsville Mountains are "not directly
        west" but "rather north" of Otter Creek Reservoir. The NO answer is based
        on a different relative position (north vs. west), not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, presented in a boxed format. This is a direct comparative answer
        to the question about relative location.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c723d69c-6ff3-4662-8298-df7afd14637c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equality of
        values is not relevant since we only evaluate this when the answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its conclusion,
        with a formal boxed answer of "YES" at the end of its step-by-step analysis.

      result: 'YES'
    da9df354-190f-4ef7-9104-ceb30820d757:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant since there wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its step-by-step analysis, stating that "Wellsville Mountains are indeed
        west of Otter Creek Reservoir."

    51bdd87e-afab-40d3-ac01-b7df7be10a70:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        or same longitude. Instead, it explains that the longitudes differ, with New
        Mexico's longitudes being generally west of Wyoming's longitudes. This difference
        in location, not equality, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with a clear "NO" answer
        in a boxed format at the end of its response, indicating that the Bighorn
        Mountains are not west of the Magdalena Mountains.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    6931d5d7-3c96-4a77-aac6-f96a68dbb402:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states they are in different
        relative positions (Bighorn Mountains are north/northeast of Magdalena Mountains).
        The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes "Bighorn Mountains in
        Wyoming are not located west of Magdalena Mountains in New Mexico" and provides
        an alternative direction (north/northeast). This is an explicit NO to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7ff643fd-1d0a-4c9d-a7c9-cd9c3c36afa8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on their different geographical
        positions, explaining that the Bighorn Mountains are more north rather than
        west of the Magdalena Mountains.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        orientation.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8269feef-abe7-4afb-b6fa-e93c07442308:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes a directional difference, stating
        that "the Magdalena Mountains are closer to the Arizona border, they are slightly
        west of the Bighorn Mountains." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, clearly stating that the Bighorn Mountains are not west
        of the Magdalena Mountains. The answer is direct and unambiguous.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b937baf0-429d-4136-bcbf-784583d6a548:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not
        relevant to evaluate since we only assess that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in bold, after concluding that "the Bighorn Mountains in Wyoming are indeed
        located west of the Magdalena Mountains in New Mexico."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer to the question is: **YES**" after its step-by-step analysis.'

    f87cf6fc-7be8-4ac9-ada6-cb5530014408:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives NO because the Bighorn Mountains are "more
        north than west compared to the Magdalena Mountains", indicating there is
        a directional difference. The NO is based on this directional relationship,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: **NO**". While the reasoning is about being "more north than west",
        it still provides a clear NO answer to the westward comparison question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Marlboro Mountains are "more to the
        south or southwest of Garnet Lake rather than directly west" - indicating
        a difference in position, not equality. The NO answer is based on the directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing this as a direct comparative result based on its geographical
        analysis.

    1bd9869d-2ad9-4817-88db-b1e448e6842b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it states the NO is because
        Marlboro Mountains are "more likely to be south or southwest of Garnet Lake"
        and explains geographical differences in their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing this directly and clearly at the end of its
        response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    32eacf4c-cde9-4559-a76c-4004ac37c725:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        or same longitude. Instead, it suggests their longitudes may overlap but primarily
        bases its NO answer on the geographical context indicating it's "unlikely
        that Marlboro Mountains are directly west." Since the NO is not based on equality
        of values, but rather on other geographical reasoning, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing this as a direct comparative result based on its geographical
        analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    59fab303-4bf0-49df-bb35-8ee4d3968bec:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Marlboro
        Mountains are "more to the south or southwest of Garnet Lake rather than directly
        west." This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing it in bold. While it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning
        ("we can't be 100% sure without a map"), it still makes a clear comparative
        judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it specifically states that Marlboro Mountains are "more to the south
        and slightly to the east of Garnet Lake" - indicating a directional difference,
        even if slight. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative directional assessment that Marlboro Mountains
        are not west of Garnet Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        locations, with Raystown Lake being east of Lake Tonawanda. The NO answer
        is given because Raystown Lake is east (not west) of Lake Tonawanda, not because
        they are in the same location.

        are equal/same - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Raystown
        Lake is southwest of Lake Tonawanda). The NO appears to be because the relationship
        is southwest rather than purely west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        on its analysis that the geographical arrangement made it "highly unlikely"
        that White Oak Lake State Park could be both south and west of Rainy Lake.
        The NO was based on a perceived impossibility of the spatial relationship,
        not because of equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at the
        same longitude or equally west/east. Instead, it explains that Mountain Lodge
        Lake is south of Lake Apopka and their positions differ more on a north-south
        axis than east-west. The NO answer is based on their relative positions being
        primarily north-south rather than because they are at the same longitude.

        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Mountain Lodge Lake is likely north
        or northwest of Lake Apopka, suggesting different positions. The NO answer
        is based on directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional comparison
        (Iowa River being in eastern/central Iowa while Ouachita Mountains are in
        western Arkansas), not because the locations are equal or the same. The model
        explicitly describes different locations and bases its NO on this difference.

        it describes the Iowa River as being "potentially at a similar longitude or
        slightly east" of the Ouachita Mountains. The NO answer appears to be based

        equal. The model never claims the locations are at the same longitude or otherwise
        equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Wrights Lake is "more towards the eastern side" while Donner Lake is "more
        towards the central or western side" - indicating a difference in position,
        not equality. The NO is because Wrights Lake is east of Donner Lake, not because
        they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, presented in a boxed format. This is an explicit comparative NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer, but not because the
        locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Never Summer
        Mountains are "southwest of Shadow Mountain Lake" and "not west of the lake
        but rather south and slightly west." This indicates a difference in position,
        not equality.

        a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" in its conclusion, both

        Shadow Mountain Lake is likely south or southwest of the Never Summer Mountains,
        rather than directly west. The model describes different relative positions
        for the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it explains that
        the NO answer is because of their relative positions (with one being in Oregon
        and one being in Washington). The model describes different positions for
        each lake, not equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (stating Siltcoos Lake is "south and slightly east" of Ozette Lake),
        not on the locations being equal or the same. Even though the difference mentioned
        may be small ("slightly east"), any stated difference means this cannot be
        classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_final_answer: The model provides analysis and concludes "Siltcoos
        Lake is located west of Ozette Lake" but never explicitly states a YES or
        NO answer to the comparison. While the conclusion implies YES, without an
        explicit YES/NO statement, this must be classified as UNKNOWN.

        relative positioning of "north and potentially at a similar longitude or slightly
        west." Since any difference in position (even if described as slight) means
        they're not exactly equal, this doesn't qualify as a NO due to equality.

        being equal or the same. Instead, the model explains that Harvey's Lake would
        be more north or northwest of Gardiners Bay, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The NO appears to be based on the fact that the relationship
        is not purely westward as asked in the question.

        west of Gardiners Bay due to the geographical arrangement of Vermont and Long
        Island.

        and slightly west" rather than "directly west." The NO is based on directional
        differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer - that
        Lake Lila is south of Chub Lake, not west. The model identifies a specific
        directional difference (south vs north) as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        longitude or are at the same east-west position. Instead, it indicates they
        are "more north-south aligned" and have no "significant westward difference,"
        but doesn't claim they are exactly equal. Any difference, even if described
        as not significant, means we should classify this as False.

        there is a directional difference, with Lake Monroe being "more to the north
        and east" than East Lake Tohopekaliga.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        part while Onondaga Lake is in the northeastern part of the county, and concludes
        NO because Otisco Lake is "likely to be west of Onondaga Lake" - indicating
        a difference in position, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        response does not indicate the lakes are at equal positions - it actually
        suggests they are at different positions (though contradictory ones).
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is contradictory and unclear.
        In step 4, it states "Onondaga Lake is located slightly to the west of Otisco
        Lake" but then immediately concludes "therefore, Onondaga Lake is not west
        of Otisco Lake." Due to this direct contradiction and lack of a clear YES/NO
        statement, the final answer should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to
        whether Long Lake (Maine) is located west of Rangeley Lake (Maine) is NO"
        - this is a clear NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the lakes being
        in the same location or having equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly states
        they are in "different parts of the state" with Long Lake being in the northern
        part and Rangeley Lake in the western part. The NO is based on this difference
        in location, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the lakes being
        in the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that Long Lake is east
        of Rangeley Lake, indicating a clear directional difference between their
        locations. The NO is based on Long Lake being east rather than west of Rangeley
        Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Rangeley Lake is specifically described as being "approximately 35 miles northwest
        of Long Lake." This indicates a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative directional result based on its analysis that
        Rangeley Lake is northwest of Long Lake.

        not because the lakes are in the same location. Instead, it explicitly states
        that Long Lake is "more to the southeast of Rangeley Lake," indicating a clear
        directional difference between their positions. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        is a directional difference, saying "the Black Mountains are located west
        of Watauga Lake" - indicating different positions. The NO is because the relationship
        is reversed from what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the primary reason for the NO answer. Instead, it states "Ivanpah Lake might
        be at a similar longitude or slightly west of Warm Lake" suggesting there
        could be a small difference. The model's reasoning focuses on Ivanpah Lake
        not being "significantly west" rather than on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative positioning
        (Lake Lahontan being east of Minaret Lake due to state locations), not because
        the locations have equal coordinates or positions. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Lake
        Lahontan is east of Minaret Lake, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer was given because one location is east

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Rather, the NO was given because the
        Southern Rocky Mountains extend beyond just being west of the Park Range -
        they cover a broader area including both western and central parts. The model
        indicates there are actual positional differences between the ranges.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the relative positions of the mountain
        ranges. The answer is based on the fact that the Southern Rocky Mountains
        are not entirely west of the Park Range, though some parts may be.

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Park Range is a subrange
        within the Southern Rocky Mountains, making a westward relationship impossible.
        This is a structural/containment reason rather than an equality reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer -
        that Misquah Hills is north of Lac des Allemands rather than west of it. The
        model is making a directional distinction, not claiming the locations are

        for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Likely YES, but without
        exact coordinates, it's uncertain." This indicates uncertainty and doesn't
        provide a clear YES/NO answer. While it leans towards YES, the qualification
        of uncertainty makes this an UNKNOWN response.

        the locations were equal/same. Rather, the model indicated there was a directional
        difference (Badwater Basin being "south and west" rather than directly west
        of Priest Lake). Any directional difference, even if described alongside another
        direction, means we must classify this as False.

    d38a9420-c5d7-41c8-ab65-deac091f1a9a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that Badwater
        Basin is "more to the south" and "not directly west" of Priest Lake. The NO
        is based on directional differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to
        whether Badwater Basin, CA is located west of Priest Lake, ID is NO" - this
        is a clear NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations are at equal longitude. Instead, it explained that while
        both are in western parts of their states, they are not directly west of each
        other, with Christmas Mountains being south of Horse Thief Lake. The NO is
        based on relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold after analyzing the geographical positions of the two locations. The

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they may be at "similar longitude,"
        it also suggests Christmas Mountains is "potentially at a similar longitude
        or slightly east." This indicates they are not exactly equal, and the NO answer
        appears to be based on Christmas Mountains being "not west" rather than being
        exactly equal in longitude. The model does not explicitly state they are exactly/approximately
        equal as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        about relative positions (south vs. north, likelihood of being west), not
        because the locations are at the same longitude. The model actually indicates
        they are in different positions, with one being more likely south or southwest
        of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or otherwise equal in their east-west position. Instead,
        it gives NO as an answer because it determines Christmas Mountains are likely
        not west of Horse Thief Lake, indicating a difference in position rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Vulture Mountains are southwest of Bitterroot Range). The NO answer
        was given because the relationship is southwest rather than purely west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Vulture Mountains is southwest of Bitterroot Range). Even though
        this means Vulture Mountains has both a southern and western component relative

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Rehoboth Bay is south of Delaware Bay and Delaware Bay is east
        of Rehoboth Bay), not because the locations are the same. The model explicitly
        notes differences in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion about the relative
        positions of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as the final answer, it does
        not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly
        states there is a directional difference, indicating that Rehoboth Bay is
        "south or southeast" of Delaware Bay. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing geographic reasoning for
        why Rehoboth Bay is not west of Delaware Bay (stating it is "south or southeast"
        instead).

        Bay." Even though it gives a NO answer, the reason is not because the locations
        are the same.

        state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states
        that Rehoboth Bay is east of Delaware Bay, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative locations.

        or at a similar longitude" to Delaware Bay, and earlier notes that Rehoboth
        Bay is "generally east of the center of Delaware Bay". Since it mentions an
        eastward position and doesn't base its NO answer purely on equality, this
        should be classified as False.

        model did not indicate the locations were equal - it actually stated one was
        west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides analysis but never explicitly states
        YES or NO to the comparison. While it concludes "Mount Monroe is located west
        of Mount Franklin," it doesn't frame this as a YES/NO answer to a comparison
        question.

        Monroe is south of Franklin rather than west of it. While they are described
        as being "in the same general area," this is not given as the reason for the
        NO answer.

        the mountains are aligned north-south rather than east-west ("Mount Monroe
        and Mount Franklin are likely north or south of each other, not west"). This
        is a directional difference, not an equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical
        - instead it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Gravelly
        Lake is to the east/northeast of the reservoir). The NO answer is based on
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

        Valley Reservoir, indicating a difference in position. The NO is based on
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that Gravelly Lake is not west of Indian

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because
        Gravelly Lake was described as being "more to the north and west" rather than
        directly west of Indian Valley Reservoir. The model identified a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the westward relationship between
        the locations. The model indicates Gravelly Lake is "more to the north and
        west" rather than directly west.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they may be at "similar longitude,"
        it also suggests Gravelly Lake is "potentially at a similar longitude or slightly
        east." The model does not explicitly state they are exactly equal as the reason
        for its NO answer. Instead, it suggests a possible slight eastward position
        difference, which means this is not a case of equal values being the primary
        reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, but with a nuanced
        perspective" as its final answer. Although it includes some qualifying language
        about the comparison being nuanced, it still provides a clear YES answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it does not
        state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that
        the NO is because California is west of Washington, indicating a difference
        in position. The model describes a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a step-by-step geographical reasoning
        to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it arrives at NO through geographic reasoning
        about relative positions, stating it's "unlikely that Eastman Lake in California
        is directly west of Alkali Lake in Oregon." The model suggests the locations
        are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with a boxed "NO" answer,
        making this a clear negative comparative result. While the model expresses
        some uncertainty in its reasoning ("we can't be entirely certain"), it still
        provides a definitive NO answer.

        Peloncillo Mountains are "to the east of Luna Lake," indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer was given because the relationship
        was opposite to what was asked (east instead of west).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the ranges are at the
        same longitude or equally west. Instead, it describes them as being in a "north-northwest
        to south-southeast orientation," indicating there is some directional difference
        between them. The NO answer is based on their relative positions, not because
        they are at the same longitude.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the ranges are in the same location. Rather, it explains its NO answer based
        on their relative positions being different (with Teton Range being south
        of Bridger Range). The model never states that the ranges are equal or identical
        in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating "Therefore, the answer to the question [...] is NO"

    96f18fdf-97dd-44f1-af8c-f2805fff4a31:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they may be at "similar longitude,"
        it also suggests the Teton Range is "potentially at a similar longitude or
        slightly east" of the Bridger Range. The model does not base its NO answer
        purely on equality, but rather on the fact that the Teton Range is likely
        "south and potentially at a similar longitude or slightly east." Since it
        mentions a possible eastern position, this is not a case of equal values being
        the primary reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model clearly concludes that "the Teton
        Range is indeed located west of the Bridger Range" and reinforces this in
        the summary, it never explicitly states a "YES" answer in the required format.
        The response is detailed and directional but lacks an explicit YES/NO statement.

        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        relative positions, with the Wapack Range being in NH and Brooks Pond being
        in MA. The NO answer is given because the model concludes the Wapack Range
        is not west of Brooks Pond, not because they are in the same location.

        have different positions (Wapack Range is east of Brooks Pond), not because
        they are equal/same. The model explicitly states a directional difference
        between the locations.

        of Galveston Bay and notes there are directional differences ("more in a north-south
        alignment"). The NO answer is based on these directional differences, not
        on equality.

        longitude or are at the same position. Instead, it states they "have different
        longitudes" and "are not directly aligned on a north-south axis." The NO answer
        appears to be based on insufficient information to confirm the westward position,
        not because the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with a boxed "NO" answer
        to whether Lake Bemidji is west of Galveston Bay. While it discusses various

        not because the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly
        states that Shinall Mountain is "to the east and south of Lake Maumelle" -
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        The NO answer is based on Prien Lake being east rather than west of Cedar
        Lake.

        question about west/east positioning, it does not base its NO answer on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after analyzing

        is based on Canada Lake being "south" rather than "west" of Tupper Lake, not
        because they share the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it gives a directional reason
        - that Spirit Lake is in a county south of Phantom Lake's county. The model
        never states the locations are at the same longitude or otherwise equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating "Phantom Lake is likely not west of Spirit Lake
        (Washington), WA is: NO"'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the lakes are "likely close
        to each other in terms of longitude" and are both in western Washington, it
        never explicitly states they are at exactly/approximately the same longitude.
        Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer based on "general geographic
        orientation." The model also notes it lacks "exact longitude data," further
        indicating it's not basing the NO on confirmed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, making a comparative directional claim even while noting some uncertainty.
        Since it provides a clear NO answer (not saying it cannot determine), this
        counts as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        evaluation is not applicable since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its conclusion,
        providing a clear affirmative answer to whether Phantom Lake is west of Spirit
        Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Phantom Lake is east of Spirit
        Lake. The NO answer is given because Phantom Lake is east (not west) of Spirit
        Lake, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" after determining that Phantom Lake is east of Spirit Lake, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Phantom Lake is to the east or northeast of Spirit Lake, indicating a clear
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response about

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        or identical coordinates. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on its analysis
        of relative positions and likely geographical relationships. The model actually
        notes potential differences in position, discussing western vs eastern parts
        of their respective states.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is

        results in False for question 2. The criteria for True only apply when examining
        NO answers that are based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" at the end
        of its response, even though it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning
        ("likely", "to confirm with 100% certainty"). Since there is an explicit YES
        answer, we classify based on that stated conclusion.

        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Tillery is south
        of Canonsburg Lake, indicating a clear directional difference. The NO answer
        is based on directional difference (being south rather than west), not on
        equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the geographical
        relationship between the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as the final answer, it does
        not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly
        states that Lake Tillery is south or southeast of Canonsburg Lake, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis. The answer is presented definitively, not as uncertainty or inability

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations
        are different, with Lake Tillery being south of Canonsburg Lake, and Canonsburg
        Lake being "further north and west." The NO answer is based on directional
        differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions

        state that the locations are at the same longitude or otherwise equal in position.
        Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer, based on their relative
        geographical positions. The model actually suggests they are in different
        positions, with one being in western PA and the other in central NC.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        presenting it as a definitive comparative conclusion based on its geographical

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions the possibility of "similar
        longitude," it also notes "slightly west" and does not base its NO answer
        primarily on equality. The response suggests Lake Tillery is "south and potentially
        at a similar longitude or slightly west" - this indicates some directional
        difference rather than pure equality as the basis for the NO answer.

        longitudes. Instead, it suggests Lake Tillery is "south and potentially at
        a similar longitude or slightly east" of Canonsburg Lake. Since it notes potential
        differences in position and doesn't base its NO answer purely on equality,
        this doesn't qualify as a NO due to equal values.

        model actually indicated a difference in position (one being west of the other)
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through the geographical analysis
        but never explicitly states "YES" or "NO" as a final comparative answer. While
        it concludes that "Diamond Valley Lake in California is located west of the
        Grapevine Mountains," it doesn't frame this as a clear YES/NO response to

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or identical. Instead, it explains that one is a subset of the
        other and therefore cannot be west of it. This is a different type of reasoning
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it as a direct comparative conclusion based on its
        analysis.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it explains that the Northern Oregon Coast Range is
        a subsection of the Oregon Coast Range and is located to the north rather
        than west. The NO answer is based on this geographical relationship rather
        than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it in bold at the end of a structured analysis. While it expresses
        some uncertainty about interpretation, it still gives a clear NO comparative
        answer.

    5ef3a0f5-23de-4683-bef1-d0e8dc2b29d1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give equality as the reason for
        its NO answer. Instead, it explains that one is a part of the other (the Northern
        Oregon Coast Range is a portion of the larger Oregon Coast Range), which is
        a different relationship than equality. The NO is based on this part-whole
        relationship rather than the two being equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result, explaining that the Northern Oregon
        Coast Range is part of, rather than west of, the Oregon Coast Range.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that the Northern Oregon Coast Range is "east of" the rest of the
        Oregon Coast Range), not because the locations are the same. The model explicitly
        states there is a positional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with a clear "NO"
        answer, stating "the answer to whether the Northern Oregon Coast Range is

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the model explains that one
        is a subset of the other ("Northern Oregon Coast Range is a part of the larger
        Oregon Coast Range") and they overlap rather than being equal. The reason
        for NO is about containment/overlap rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on its geographical analysis. The
        NO answer is given as a direct response to the comparative location question.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Northern Oregon Coast
        Range is located to the north of the Oregon Coast Range, giving a directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a clear comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two mountain ranges.

    cb9d6b9a-58fb-4dac-9e67-376b491301aa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave NO because one range is a sub-range of the other,
        explaining that the Northern Oregon Coast Range "cannot be entirely west of
        the Oregon Coast Range" because "it is a part of the same range." This is
        a different reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a clear comparative result based on its analysis that the
        Northern Oregon Coast Range is a sub-range within the larger Oregon Coast
        Range.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because the
        Northern Oregon Coast Range is part of the Oregon Coast Range and therefore
        cannot be west of the entire range. The model actually notes some directional
        differences, mentioning that the Northern part is "west of the southern part
        of the range."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Joe Pool Lake is south of Lake of the Arbuckles rather than west of it. The
        NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        instead of west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        concludes that Joe Pool Lake is "not located west of Lake of the Arbuckles"
        and is instead "generally south."

        Lake Washington is likely "east or south of Lake Norman, but not directly
        west." Since the NO is based on a directional difference rather than equality,
        this is False.

        being the reason for the NO answer. Additionally, the model's reasoning focuses
        on the lakes being at similar but not identical positions.

        is based on the geographical analysis showing Lake Washington is not west
        of Lake Norman, not because they are at the same longitude.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it concludes NO because it
        determines Tomales Bay is west of Long Lake (due to California being west
        of Washington). The model describes a directional difference, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because of their different relative
        positions (House Range being "central-west" while Raft River Mountains are
        "in the north"). The model indicates there is a positional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result based on its geographic analysis.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that House Range is "in the western-central
        part" while Raft River Mountains are "in the northwestern part" and concludes
        House Range is "south or southeast" of Raft River Mountains. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether House Range is located west of Raft River Mountains.
        This NO is presented as a direct comparative result, not as an inability to
        determine.

        suggests the locations are "potentially at a similar longitude," it does not
        explicitly state they are equal/same/identical as the primary reason for its
        NO answer. Instead, it emphasizes that the House Range is "south and potentially
        at a similar longitude" rather than west of the Raft River Mountains.

        Lake" or "at a similar longitude" but ultimately concludes NO based on geographical
        analysis. Even the mention of "similar longitude" is presented as an alternative
        possibility rather than the reason for the NO answer.

        there is a directional difference, with Gull Lake being southwest rather than
        directly west of Lake Mitchell
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        there is a positional difference, with one being "more towards the southwest"
        and the other "more towards the north."
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Gull Lake is not west of Lake
        Mitchell" which is a clear NO answer to whether one location is west of the
        other. While it elaborates that it's "more to the southwest," this doesn't

        west" of Lake Mitchell. Even though the westward difference is described as
        "slight," any difference means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when evaluating whether Gull Lake is west of Lake Mitchell. The answer is

        Otter Tail Lake is "likely not west of Matagorda Bay but rather north and
        potentially at a similar longitude or slightly east." The mention of "slightly

        or the same. In fact, it indicates that Herrington Lake would be "southwest
        of Higgins Lake," implying a difference in location. The NO answer appears
        to be given because the model concludes the location is southwest rather than
        purely west.

        they're not exactly equal, and the NO answer appears to be based on directional
        difference rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        longitude or are at the same east-west position. Instead, it gave NO because
        it determined Soap Lake is north/northeast of Mirror Lake, indicating a different
        position
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing geographical reasoning for why Soap Lake is

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Soap Lake is east
        of Mirror Lake (California), indicating a clear directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying Soap
        Lake is "more north and slightly east of Mirror Lake." This difference, even
        though described as "slight" for the eastern component, means the locations
        are not equal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer but explicitly states
        there is a difference in position, saying "Boundary Pass is more to the north
        and slightly east of Henry Hagg Lake." The NO is not based on equal values,
        but rather on a specific directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on geographical analysis. The answer
        is presented definitively, not as uncertainty or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2b3d33a0-a3cf-4f36-aed8-2f0dd6de29e9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate if equal values were the reason
        for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "LIKELY YES" which is not
        a definitive YES. While it leans towards yes, it explicitly states uncertainty
        ("we can't be 100% sure") and hedges the answer. This makes it an unclear/uncertain
        response rather than a definitive YES.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    5de34310-68d7-4fbd-82b6-e950c93ffc7b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the classification rules, regardless
        of any content about relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Boundary Pass, WA is located
        west of Henry Hagg Lake, OR" but never explicitly states "YES" as a direct
        answer. While the conclusion clearly supports a westward relationship, without
        an explicit YES, this must be classified as UNKNOWN per the strict classification
        rules.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    5fd99ded-f60c-4cd3-a270-b5df609f26fb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explains that Boundary Pass is north
        of Henry Hagg Lake (indicating different positions). The NO is because one
        location is north rather than west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        NO" after explaining that Boundary Pass is north of Henry Hagg Lake, not west.
        This is a clear negative comparative answer.'

    73997a82-ee24-4b3d-92dd-56e98d611732:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude or that they are the same. Instead, it gives a different reason
        for the NO answer - explaining that Boundary Pass's location in northern Washington
        relative to Henry Hagg Lake's location in central-western Oregon means it's
        not west of the lake.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        **NO**" as a clear comparative result after its analysis.'

    77cc5623-eff2-4236-be10-fd151469b853:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it concluded NO because it
        determined Boundary Pass is east of Henry Hagg Lake, indicating a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, clearly stating that Boundary Pass is not west of Henry
        Hagg Lake (indicating it's east instead).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d11976c1-9a90-4c4b-ae42-8fbe46f47928:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative positioning
        (Boundary Pass being north rather than west of Henry Hagg Lake), not because
        the locations have equal longitude. The model never states that the locations
        are at the same longitude or otherwise equal in their east-west positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: **NO**" as a direct comparative answer to whether Boundary Pass
        is west of Henry Hagg Lake.'

      result: 'NO'
    d8ace2a4-e414-4e6f-bef8-d9e7b3966374:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes a directional difference, saying
        Boundary Pass is "more to the north and slightly west of Henry Hagg Lake."
        Even though "slightly west" is mentioned, any difference means it's not an
        equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear directional explanation that Boundary Pass is "more to
        the north and slightly west of Henry Hagg Lake."
      final_answer: 'NO'

    daec345d-05d8-42a7-9329-4c47d733b84d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the locations might be at
        "a similar longitude," it does not explicitly state they are exactly equal
        or identical. The model's reasoning suggests they are at different but close
        longitudes, and it emphasizes the north-south relationship rather than exact
        longitude equality as the primary reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" in a clear and unambiguous way at the end of its response.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

    dbe5b525-5fb1-4d02-8d78-483517af9a96:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or otherwise equal in their east-west position. Instead,
        it gives a NO answer based on reasoning about their relative positions, indicating
        that Boundary Pass is likely further north but not west of Henry Hagg Lake.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this conclusion.

    7810be01-a1d6-4abb-8926-cb076d591415:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on its reasoning about relative
        positions, stating it's "unlikely that Baldwin Lake is west of Diaz Lake"
        due to geographic considerations. Even though there is uncertainty, the model
        suggests different positions rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its final comparative answer, even though it acknowledges
        uncertainty in the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - it actually specifies that Diaz Lake is east of Baldwin Lake,
        indicating a clear directional difference between their positions. The NO
        answer is given because of this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that Baldwin Lake is not west of Diaz Lake (in
        fact stating that Diaz Lake is east of Baldwin Lake)

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model did not indicate the locations were equal - it actually suggested Baldwin
        Lake was west of Diaz Lake.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES/NO answer.
        While it states "Baldwin Lake... is indeed located west of Diaz Lake," it
        qualifies this by saying more precise geographical information would be needed.
        This hedging makes the final answer unclear.
