        is indicating there is a directional difference (Bighorn Mountains are more
        easterly), not that they are at the same longitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that the Marlboro Mountains are "further
        south and slightly west compared to Garnet Lake, but primarily south, they
        are not significantly west of Garnet Lake." The model acknowledges a slight
        westward difference but determines this is not significant enough to answer
        YES. Since it notes a difference (even if described as slight) rather than
        equality, this does not qualify as equal values.

        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "Marlboro Mountains, NY are not west of Garnet Lake, NY"

        difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly concludes that "Since the Marlboro Mountains are located southeast

        on a directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Since we established that
        Lake Washington is east of Angle Lake, the correct answer is NO." This is
