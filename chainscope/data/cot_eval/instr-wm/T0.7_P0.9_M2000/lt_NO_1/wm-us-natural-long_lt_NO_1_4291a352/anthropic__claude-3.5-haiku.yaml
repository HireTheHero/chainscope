      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Wellsville Mountains are EAST of Otter Creek Reservoir,
        indicating a directional difference.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Marlboro
        Mountains is east of Garnet Lake, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO was due to the direction being opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Marlboro Mountains is east
        (not west) of Garnet Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Marlboro
        Mountains is east of Garnet Lake (opposite direction), not because the locations
        have equal positions. The model explicitly states a directional difference
        ("Marlboro Mountains is actually east of Garnet Lake, not west").

        determined Marlboro Mountains is east of Garnet Lake (opposite direction from
        what was presumably being asked). The model explicitly states a directional
        difference between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Raystown
        Lake is east of Lake Tonawanda (a directional difference), not because the
        locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a
        directional difference ("Raystown Lake is actually east of Lake Tonawanda,
        not west").

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states that Raystown Lake is east
        of Lake Tonawanda and that Lake Tonawanda is "further west." The NO is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative result indicating Raystown Lake is NOT west
        of Lake Tonawanda.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO answer was given because
        Raystown Lake was determined to be southeast of Lake Tonawanda, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positions. The model concludes that Raystown Lake is southeast of Lake Tonawanda,
        not west of it.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Raystown Lake is explicitly stated to be east of Lake Tonawanda, indicating
        a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on its comparative analysis that Raystown Lake is east
        of Lake Tonawanda, not west.

        the two mountains.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply couldn't locate one
        of them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot answer YES or NO to this question due to insufficient
        geographic information." This indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to inability to locate one of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (Iowa River is east of the Ouachita Mountains), not
        because they are equal. The model explicitly states a directional difference
        and does not mention the locations being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical comparison

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were at equal longitude. Instead, it explained that Iowa
        River is north of the Ouachita Mountains and therefore not west of them. The
        NO was based on relative positioning, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion stating "The answer is NO, Iowa River, IA is not
        located west of Ouachita Mountains, AR" and again as a final "NO" at the end.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because Shadow
        Mountain Lake is explicitly stated to be east of the Never Summer Mountains,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, supported by directional reasoning that Shadow Mountain
        Lake is east of the Never Summer Mountains, not west.

        between their positions. The NO answer was given because their relative positions
        are opposite to what was asked in the question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the lakes are in the same location or have equal positions. Instead, the NO
        was given because Long Lake is explicitly stated to be east of Rangeley Lake,
        indicating a difference in position (just in the opposite direction than what
        was being asked). The model notes a clear directional difference between the

        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating

        The NO is due to the direction being opposite of what was asked, not due to
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (with Watauga Lake being east of the
        Black Mountains), not because they are in the same location. The model explicitly
        states a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        is east of the Black Mountains, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states a directional difference ("Watauga Lake is east of the Black Mountains"),
        so this is not a case of equal values.

        Since this is a case where the model rejects the premise by stating one location

        Crazy Lake is east of Mono Lake, indicating a directional difference. The
        NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

        (one being east of the other), not because the locations are equal or the
        same. The model explicitly states that the Southern Rocky Mountains are east
        of the Park Range as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (Southern Rocky
        Mountains being east of Park Range) to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined the Southern Rocky Mountains are actually east/southeast
        of Park Range, indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying the Southern Rocky Mountains are EAST of the Park Range.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with "The Southern Rocky Mountains are NOT located
        west of Park Range (Colorado), CO." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        is a directional difference (one is east of the other), which is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative directional result, explaining that the Southern
        Rocky Mountains are east of, not west of, the Park Range.

        being west of Lake Verret. The NO was based on the directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determined
        Lake Verret is east of Lake Wissota, not because the locations are at the
        same longitude. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("Lake Verret is east of Lake Wissota"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, concluding that Lake Verret

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Lake Verret is
        "east and south of Lake Wissota" and that Louisiana is "much further south
        and east compared to Wisconsin." The NO answer was given because of this directional
        difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        it determines that Minnesota is west of Louisiana but concludes this means
        Misquah Hills is NOT west of Lac des Allemands. While this reasoning may be

        of (not west of) Buena Vista Lake.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 5 and again as a final standalone answer. The model makes a
        clear comparative judgment about the relative positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    28209ea5-14c0-4045-95ab-9cff449036ab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that "Potholes Reservoir
        is east of Buena Vista Lake, not west." The NO is based on a directional difference
        between the locations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question about whether Potholes Reservoir
        is west of Buena Vista Lake. The answer is definitive and directly addresses
        the comparison.

      result: 'NO'
    33ee7c46-4f89-4351-9e8d-1efecf001d2b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Potholes Reservoir is east of (not west of) Buena Vista
        Lake - indicating a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis showing
        Potholes Reservoir is east of (not west of) Buena Vista Lake.'

    40e0cdf6-f5e1-4bbb-9423-6aee28f30a54:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (with Potholes Reservoir being east of
        Buena Vista Lake), not because they are at the same location. The model never
        states or suggests the locations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical
        analysis that Potholes Reservoir is east, not west, of Buena Vista Lake.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that the locations
        are "quite far apart" and concludes NO because Potholes Reservoir is actually
        east of Buena Vista Lake. The reason for NO is a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result to whether Potholes Reservoir is west
        of Buena Vista Lake. The answer is explicit and definitive.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Potholes Reservoir is "east of Buena Vista Lake," indicating a clear
        directional difference between the two locations. The NO answer was based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        position. The model states that Potholes Reservoir is "actually east of Buena
        Vista Lake" rather than west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Potholes Reservoir is east of Buena Vista Lake), not because
        the locations have equal longitude. The model explicitly states there is a
        difference in their east-west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, concluding that Potholes Reservoir
        is NOT west of Buena Vista Lake.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Potholes Reservoir is EAST of Buena Vista Lake, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, providing a definitive comparative answer about
        the geographical relationship between the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - rather, it explicitly states that Potholes Reservoir is EAST
        of Buena Vista Lake, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations. The NO is because the relationship is opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations. This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Lake Stanley
        Draper is east of Lake Worth, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the geographic relationship
        between the two locations. The answer is stated twice, both in step 4 and

        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that "Orange Lake, NY
        is north and west of Toms River, NJ" and gives the NO answer because Orange
        Lake is not purely west (it's northwest). The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, specifically concluding that "Orange Lake (New
        York), NY is NOT located west of Toms River, NJ." This is a direct comparative
        answer.

        is based on Lake Cunningham being east, not on the locations having equal
        longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether Lake Cunningham is west of Upper Klamath Lake.

        these are the same geographic feature ("sound like the same geographic feature"
        and "part of the same range"), making it impossible for one to be west of
        the other. This equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the reason given was that
        one is a subset of the other and therefore cannot be west of it. The model
        explains this is a logical impossibility due to the containment relationship,
        not because of equal positions.

        Coast Range is part of the Oregon Coast Range, it does not state they are
        equal/identical/the same as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it explains
        that one being a subset of the other makes it impossible for the subset to

      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/identical. Instead, it argues that the comparison is logically
        impossible because one location is a part of the other, making it impossible
        for it to be "west of" itself. This is a different reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:

        in step 4, indicating a difference in position (even though this contradicts
        its final NO answer). Since the NO answer is not based on equality of positions,
        this should be classified as False.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Gull Lake is east of Lake
        Mitchell, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the reasoning and once as a final standalone answer. This is a clear
        negative comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f72a743b-7eb4-4864-b748-aa310a687d01:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Gull Lake was explicitly stated to be southeast of Lake Mitchell, indicating
        a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" and provides a direct comparative result based on geographical positions,
        finding that Gull Lake is southeast of Lake Mitchell (not west).'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating "Otter Tail Lake is east of Matagorda Bay, not west" and that they
        are "in different states." The NO answer is based on directional differences,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, saying "Otter
        Tail Lake is significantly east of Matagorda Bay." The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and "NOT located

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (with Otter Tail Lake being east of Matagorda
        Bay), not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly states
        they are "quite far apart" and gives directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as a direct comparative answer, indicating that Otter Tail Lake is not west
        of Matagorda Bay (in fact stating it is east)'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that "Otter Tail Lake is east of
        Matagorda Bay, not west" - indicating a difference in position was the reason
        for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude. Instead, it explicitly states that Otter Tail Lake is east
        of Matagorda Bay, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing the comparative question of whether Otter Tail Lake is
        west of Matagorda Bay. The answer is definitive and explicit.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    ce4e7d45-c178-4ca1-8d17-11ba0316ab8c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Otter Tail Lake is east of Matagorda Bay, not west), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly notes a difference
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical
        analysis.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Otter Tail
        Lake is "significantly northeast of Matagorda Bay" and uses this directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographic comparison showing
        Otter Tail Lake is northeast of Matagorda Bay.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its determination
        that "Herrington Lake is east of Higgins Lake, not west" - indicating a directional
        difference, not equality. The NO comes from finding they are in opposite directions
        from what was asked, not from being in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" and confirms "Herrington Lake, KY is not located west of Higgins Lake,
        MI." This is a direct NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Herrington Lake was determined to be southeast of Higgins Lake, indicating
        a directional difference.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional comparison,
        concluding that Herrington Lake is east of Higgins Lake (not west). The model
        does not state or suggest the locations are at the same longitude - it explicitly
        states they are at different positions, with one being east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes "Herrington Lake is
        NOT west of Higgins Lake" and gives a clear "Answer: NO" at the end. This

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined Herrington
        Lake is east of Higgins Lake, not because the locations are at the same longitude.
        It explicitly states a directional difference ("Herrington Lake is east of
        Higgins Lake")

        NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Herrington
        Lake is "further south and east" compared to Higgins Lake, not because the
        locations are equal. It explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides directional reasoning leading to that conclusion (specifically
        that Herrington Lake is "further south and east" compared to Higgins Lake)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states that Herrington Lake is east
        of Higgins Lake and uses this difference in position as the reason for its
        NO answer. The model is saying NO because there is a directional difference,
        not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the comparison steps. The answer is definitive
        and comparative, not indicating uncertainty or refusal.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing values since it couldn't verify one location's
        existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE" and
        explains it cannot verify one location's existence to make the comparison.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison due to insufficient information about Mirror Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - rather, it concludes that Soap Lake is likely EAST of Mirror
        Lake. The model indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" and
        "NO, Soap Lake, WA is NOT located west of Mirror Lake (California), CA." This

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations have different positions (Soap Lake is east of Mirror Lake), not
        because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states a directional
        difference between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and indicates it cannot determine the relationship
        because it cannot verify one location. This is a case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

        locations are equal/same/identical. The model states that Soap Lake is in
        eastern Washington and explicitly concludes it is NOT west of Mirror Lake
        because of their relative positions, indicating a difference in location rather
        than equality.
