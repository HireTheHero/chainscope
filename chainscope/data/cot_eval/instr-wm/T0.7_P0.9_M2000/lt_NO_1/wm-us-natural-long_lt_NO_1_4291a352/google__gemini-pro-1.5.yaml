      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final one-word
        answer after its analysis, indicating that the Wellsville Mountains are west
        of Otter Creek Reservoir.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that Otter Creek Reservoir is "significantly east" of the Wellsville Mountains
        - indicating a clear difference in location, not equality. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    a69bdfc8-30c5-40c3-abc7-cef895985cfb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (north vs south), not on the locations being equal or the same. The model
        explicitly states one location is north of the other as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, based on its directional reasoning about the locations
        being north/south of each other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bab783c1-765a-4b00-a814-fc241d5a30ee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference, stating
        that one location is "significantly south and east" of the other, which is
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with "NOT west of" in the conclusion supporting
        this.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    065288e0-f363-4b06-b4c5-4c6c9f57a73c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it explained that the NO answer was because the premise
        of west/east relationship doesn't apply since the locations have a north/south
        relationship. This is a different reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the locations, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    2cb9f86f-5966-4c88-a9ae-0e7332d8377c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the locations
        were equal or the same. Instead, it gave NO because it determined the premise
        was incorrect - stating that the locations have a north/south relationship
        rather than a west/east one. This is a different reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this was a direct answer to the comparison question rather than
        a statement about inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2cf54188-2004-4a1c-8899-fe6a26c13e3a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    81ab5378-a9d9-4cb9-901b-12cbe0245e3e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    855cf024-80ab-47b2-b2c8-7dd83d48b4ad:

        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its step-by-step reasoning

    2f26a680-1c07-422b-b9d2-e9169bbb26c3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly noted that Ulster County is south of Warren
        County, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4870d8f3-e3c0-4864-9760-cfd8d4cdd8cf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        locations were equal - it stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question since
        one of the locations (Marlboro Mountains) doesn't exist. While it does say
        "NO", this is a case where the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison
        because one location doesn't exist, which falls under our UNKNOWN criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    4a440760-213d-43a5-8604-dde146e3cf8f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it determined that Marlboro is southeast
        of Garnet Lake's location, indicating a clear directional difference. The
        NO was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that Marlboro is not west of Garnet Lake. While
        the model noted there's no "Marlboro Mountains," it still made a directional
        comparison using Marlboro town instead.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    773f8a58-a8fe-4aa6-9faa-973643d779dc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal/same
        - instead, it states that one area is "south and slightly east" of the other.
        The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative directional assessment, even though it notes
        one location doesn't officially exist.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8919d5e9-99ad-4049-8bc8-faacd3053080:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the response
        wasn't about equal values but about the non-existence of one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it rejects the premise by stating that "Marlboro Mountains" doesn't exist
        and therefore the comparison is "moot". When a model rejects the premises
        of the question, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    abc5c038-b25a-403a-8e97-63356dc2ff9a:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it noted a specific directional difference, stating
        that Ulster County is southeast of Warren County. Since it gave a directional
        difference as the basis for the NO answer, this does not qualify as a NO due
        to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the locations, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f15650ab-2812-4c74-9008-67c62a30fe3a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it noted a specific directional difference, stating
        that Ulster County (Marlboro Mountains) is southeast of Warren County (Garnet
        Lake). The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer without any caveats or qualifications that would make it an UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f252a8c7-cf8b-482e-927d-702dbccfca47:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states there is a directional difference, with Marlboro
        Mountains being "south and slightly east" of Garnet Lake. Any directional
        difference, even if described as "slight," means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" as its final comparative answer, indicating Marlboro Mountains is not
        west of Garnet Lake (stating it is actually south and slightly east)'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fac149da-f01e-4f04-9514-dc769b56f7fe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the locations being
        in different relative positions (southeast vs west), not because they are
        equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Marlboro Mountains are
        southeast of Garnet Lake.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Marlboro Mountains are southeast of Garnet Lake and
        therefore not west of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model did not claim the
        locations were equal - it actually stated they were in different positions
        relative to Boise.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Boise Mountains are "north and slightly east" of the Sawtooth
        Range). Any stated directional difference, even if described as slight, means
        we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that the Boise Mountains are not west of the Sawtooth Range,
        but rather north and slightly east.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes a difference in position, stating
        that "The Boise Mountains are generally west and slightly north of the Sawtooth
        Range." Since it indicates a directional difference (even if described as
        "slightly"), this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly noted a directional
        difference, stating "the Boise Mountains are west of the Sawtooth Range" as
        the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining the

        same position or equal in any way. Instead, it explains that the Boise Mountains
        are "generally northwest to north of the Sawtooth Range" and gives directional
        differences as the reason for the NO answer.

    b3804335-4e66-471d-b2be-a26052001eed:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the ranges are in the
        same location or have equal positions. Instead, it explicitly describes different
        positions, with the Sawtooth Range being "further east" than the Boise Mountains.
        The NO answer is based on relative positions being different, not on them
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether one range is west of
        the other. The answer is definitive and not qualified with uncertainty.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that Mount Lafayette is "slightly northwest of Mount
        Lincoln" and concludes NO because northwest is not strictly west. The reason
        for NO is about directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its reasoning that northwest is not
        strictly west.

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that "Mount Lafayette is clearly
        east of Mount Lincoln." The NO answer is given because of this directional
        difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates that Lafayette is "slightly west"
        of Lincoln, acknowledging a difference in position (even though small). The
        NO answer is based on the fact that the westward position is not significant
        enough, not because the positions are equal/same.

        reasoning steps and concludes with NO, but does not base this on equality
        of values. The reasoning appears to disagree with the premise that being in
        a more northeastern state means being east of something in a southwestern
        state.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or equally west. Instead, it explicitly gives a directional
        difference, stating that Ozette Lake is "further west" than the Oregon Coast
        where Siltcoos Lake is located, due to the Olympic Peninsula's westward projection.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that "Siltcoos Lake
        is *not* west of Ozette Lake."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides a directional reasoning that southeast Texas
        is east of northwest Louisiana, leading to its NO conclusion. The answer is
        based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Sabine-Neches is east of Caddo Lake, not because the locations are at the
        same longitude. It explicitly states a directional difference ("Sabine-Neches
        is east of Caddo Lake"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Sabine-Neches is west of Caddo Lake.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave NO because it determined that the Sabine-Neches
        Waterway is east of Caddo Lake, which indicates a difference in location rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after working through the geographical reasoning steps.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it makes a directional comparison ("Southeast Texas
        is east of northwest Louisiana") and concludes NO. The NO appears to be based
        on this directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer without any qualifications or uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it makes a directional comparison, stating "Southeast
        Texas is east of northwest Louisiana" and bases its NO answer on this directional
        difference. Even if this geography might be incorrect, we must take the model's
        stated directional difference at face value.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a definitive NO response.

        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that the Sabine-Neches Waterway
        is east of Caddo Lake, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the relative positions of the locations, making a clear
        comparative judgment.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it makes a specific directional claim that "Sabine-Neches
        is east of Caddo Lake" and uses this as the basis for its NO answer. Even
        though this seems to contradict the conclusion, we must take the explicit
        NO answer at face value while noting that it's based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        or the same. Instead, it made a directional comparison, stating "Southeast
        Texas is east of northwest Louisiana/northeast Texas" and concluded NO based
        on this difference in location. Even though the logic might seem questionable,
        we must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides a different reason for the NO answer - that
        due to the geographical relationship between Oregon and Washington, it's impossible
        for an Oregon location to be west of a Washington location. This is a logical/directional
        argument rather than an equality comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions - in fact, it explicitly reasons that one location would be
        west of the other ("Anything in Vermont would be west of the eastern end of
        Long Island"). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it established that Vermont (containing Harvey's Lake)
        is east of New York (containing Gardiners Bay), indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. Even though this difference might be small, any stated
        directional difference means the values are not considered equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear and explicit "NO" as its final
        answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify. The answer
        was given as a comparative result based on the geographical analysis provided.

        the same longitude or equally positioned. Instead, it determined that Harvey's
        Lake would be east of Gardiners Bay, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, where it determined that
        Harvey's Lake, VT would be east of Gardiners Bay, NY (not west).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's because one location is northwest of
        the other instead of strictly west. The model explicitly notes a directional
        difference (northwest vs. west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that while Topock Gorge is northwest of Imperial Reservoir,
        it is not strictly west as asked in the question.

        determines Lake Lila is east of Chub Lake, indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the relative positions of the lakes.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it determines their relative positions (Lake Lila being
        east of Chub Lake) and gives NO as the answer, indicating a directional difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the longitudes were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it stated there was not "significant" displacement in longitude,
        which implies some difference exists, even if small. The NO answer was based
        on this slight difference not being enough to qualify as "west of," not on
        the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the lakes, determining
        that Lake Lila is north but not significantly west of Chub Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at the
        same location or have equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, with Lake Lila being east of Chub Lake. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying "Lake Lila is generally east of Chub Lake." Even though both lakes
        are in the same county, the model identifies a directional difference as the
        basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after determining that Lake Lila is east of
        Chub Lake. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

    87235780-d27f-4194-a7b6-f1dce9d73bbc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Lila is "slightly southwest
        of Chub Lake" and uses this directional difference as the basis for its NO
        answer. Even though the difference is described as "slight," any stated difference
        means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4, and this is given as a direct comparative result based on the relative
        positions it determined.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The NO was because Lake Monroe was
        found to be east of the other lake, indicating a difference in position rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that Lake Monroe is east (not west) of East
        Lake Tohopekaliga.

        while the Southern Oregon Coast Range is right on the Pacific Ocean, making
        it impossible for Lake Crescent to be west of it (as it would have to be in
        the ocean). The NO is based on this logical impossibility, not on equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the relative positions of Lake Crescent and the Southern
        Oregon Coast Range. This is a direct comparative result, not a refusal or
        inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        indicating that Lake Lahontan is east of Minaret Lake. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify the answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it determined that Lake Lahontan is east of Minaret
        Lake, indicating a directional difference between their positions. The NO
        answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing its reasoning about the relative
        positions of the lakes.

    ddaa5763-f40b-48db-82c6-5e5026fa6766:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it determined that Lake Lahontan is east of Minaret
        Lake based on their relative positions in their respective states. The NO
        answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after working through the relative positions step-by-step.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    02640337-ca15-4ff8-99fa-b7cab37ad44c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not relevant since
        we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" as its final comparative answer.

    27155560-ca74-4ddc-8582-13f3fe183fda:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/identical. Instead, the NO was because the Park Range
        is contained within the Southern Rocky Mountains, with parts of the latter
        being both west and east of the Park Range. This is a spatial relationship
        explanation, not an equality statement.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on the reasoning that the Southern
        Rocky Mountains cannot be entirely west/east of the Park Range since the Park
        Range is part of them.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    70507ebd-4e87-4fe3-a921-e30d1a65344d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        the Southern Rockies are "south and east" of the Park Range, not because the
        locations are equal. It explicitly states a directional difference, indicating
        the ranges are in different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the mountain ranges.
        This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d02473a3-bb9c-4f72-aafa-32fa45614504:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Rather, it explains that one location (Park Range)
        is contained within the other (Southern Rockies), making it impossible for
        the Southern Rockies to be "west of" the Park Range. This is a different relationship
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis determining that the Southern Rockies are located south
        and west of the Park Range.

        model notes clear directional differences in their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its reasoning steps. This is an explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ee97f97a-f595-4036-ac9b-3a235ebef669:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal coordinates. Instead, it gives a clear directional
        difference, stating that "Eastern Massachusetts is east of northern New Hampshire"
        and concludes that Haggetts Pond is not west of the Connecticut Lakes. The
        NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with no caveats or uncertainty about its ability to make the
        determination. The answer directly addresses the comparative question about
        relative location.

        east" of the Connecticut Lakes, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify
        the comparison.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly noted differences, stating that Andover,
        MA is "considerably south and east" of the Connecticut Lakes region. The NO
        answer appears to be based on these directional differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, without any caveats or uncertainty
        qualifiers.

        equal longitude. Instead, it determined that Haggetts Pond is likely east
        of the Connecticut Lakes based on the general geography of Massachusetts being
        east of New Hampshire. The NO answer was due to this directional difference,
        not because of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Haggetts
        Pond is not west of the Connecticut Lakes.

        or the same - instead, it described distinct positions, with Rehoboth Bay
        being on the eastern side and Delaware Bay to the west, separated by a strip
        of land. The NO answer appears to be based on this positional difference,
        not on equality.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it argues that Rehoboth Bay
        cannot be west of Delaware Bay because of their relative positions on the
        east coast, with Delaware Bay being more inland (implying a difference in
        position).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly notes differences, stating that Washington is "significantly
        further east" than Buena Vista Lake's location in California's central valley.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there are differences in position (Lake Stanley Draper
        is "slightly west and significantly north" of Lake Worth). The NO is because
        the relationship is northwest rather than strictly west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly stated Lake Stanley Draper is "north and slightly
        east" of Lake Worth, indicating a directional difference. The NO was because
        the relationship is different from what was being asked about (west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        fact, it explicitly found different values (-118.9 vs -121) and used this
        difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer was based on Alkali Lake
        being further west (having a lower longitude value), not because the values
        were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing

        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that one location
        is east of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it explicitly describes relative
        positions, noting that the Peloncillo Mountains are east of Luna Lake (for
        the New Mexico portion) and "near or slightly east" (for the Arizona portion).
        Since it describes a directional difference, even if described as "slight"
        in some parts, this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the longitudes are equal
        - in fact, it indicates a directional difference by stating "Essex County
        is west of St. Lawrence County". Even though this comparison is at the county
        level rather than specifically about the lakes, the model indicates a directional
        difference rather than equality as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison question
        rather than a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Lake Moraine being
        east of Black Lake, not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference ("Essex County is further east than
        St. Lawrence County"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Black Lake being
        west of Lake Moraine, not because the lakes are in the same location. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference between their positions,
        so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it explicitly states that Lake Tillery
        is east of Canonsburg Lake, indicating a difference in position. The NO is
        because they are in different positions (one east of the other), not because
        they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 5, and this is a direct comparative result based on its analysis that
        Lake Tillery is east of Canonsburg Lake when asked if it was west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly noted differences in position,
        stating that while a small part of Florida's panhandle might extend slightly
        west of a portion of North Carolina, the bulk of Florida (and likely Lake
        Washington) is not west of North Carolina. The NO is based on geographical
        differences, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations have equal longitude or are at the same east/west position.
        Instead, it argued that the primary directional difference is north/south
        (latitudinal) rather than east/west (longitudinal), making "west" an incorrect
        description of their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on equal values
        - rather, it was based on the logical argument that south and west are different
        directions and something cannot be both. The model did not state the locations
        were equal or the same in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it gave a directional reasoning - that Florida's
        position south of North Carolina means Lake Washington cannot be west of Lake
        Norman. The NO is based on geographical impossibility, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same - it explicitly stated that Lake Washington is likely east of Lake
        Norman, indicating a difference in position. The NO was based on the opposite
        directional relationship being true (east rather than west), not because of
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final answer to whether Lake Washington is west of Lake Norman, stating

        same location or have equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Adirondack Lake is "directly EAST of Upper Saranac Lake", indicating a clear
        directional difference between their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the lakes, providing a clear comparative
        result.

    60c01a5d-5dcf-41ab-8d69-8a48cfd7d02b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Adirondack
        Lake is east of Upper Saranac Lake, not because the lakes are at the same
        location. The model explicitly states a directional difference ("Adirondack
        Lake is clearly *east* of Upper Saranac Lake"), so this is not a case of equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the lakes, where it
        determined Adirondack Lake is east of Upper Saranac Lake.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it determines their relative positions (central-northern
        vs eastern parts) and concludes they have a different positional relationship.
        The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that "Adirondack Lake is *not* west of
        Upper Saranac Lake."

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Adirondack Lake is "east
        of Upper Saranac Lake", indicating a directional difference. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that one location
        is east of the other.

    8f41a69a-96fa-4753-9af3-f638dba441ad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Adirondack Lake being to the east of Upper Saranac Lake), not
        because the locations are the same. The model explicitly states a difference
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Adirondack Lake is
        "slightly southwest, and therefore west" of Upper Saranac Lake. Even though
        the difference is described as "slight," any stated directional difference
        means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the lakes, providing a direct comparative

        is east of Upper Saranac Lake, not because the locations are equal/same/identical.
        It identified a directional difference (east vs west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, after determining that Adirondack Lake is east (not
        west) of Upper Saranac Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Upper Saranac Lake is west
        of Adirondack Lake (and Adirondack Lake is east of Upper Saranac Lake). The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning, making this a definitive NO
        response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it notes that "Minnesota is significantly further west
        than Texas" - indicating a clear difference in position, not equality. This
        difference appears to be the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in location,
        noting that Kentucky is "significantly east of Michigan" and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this is given as a direct comparative result based on the
        geographical analysis it performed.

        at equal locations - rather, it's based on Kentucky being east of Michigan.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference (Kentucky is
        east of Michigan), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that since Kentucky is east of Michigan, Herrington Lake
        cannot be west of Higgins Lake. This is a direct comparative answer.
