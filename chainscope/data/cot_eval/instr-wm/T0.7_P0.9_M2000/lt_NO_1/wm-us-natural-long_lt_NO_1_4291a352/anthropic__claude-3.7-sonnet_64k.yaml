        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "The Mosquito Range
        is located east of Pacific Tarn, not west of it." The model is indicating
        a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the lakes are in
        different locations with Chub Lake being west of Lake Lila. The model's reasoning
        for the NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Lake Lila is located west of Chub Lake. The model provides a step-by-step

        answer because the values being compared are the same - it gave what was classified
        as an UNKNOWN answer because it couldn't verify the existence of Crazy Lake.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that Crazy Lake, CA is located west of Mono Lake, CA because I don't have
        evidence that a lake by this name exists in California." This is not a straightforward
        NO to the comparative question, but rather indicates the model cannot determine
        the relationship because it cannot verify the existence of one of the entities
        being compared. The model is rejecting the premise that Crazy Lake exists,

        Mono Lake is "on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada mountains near the
        Nevada border." The model's NO answer is based on this geographical difference,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that House Range is positioned
        east of the Raft River Mountains, indicating a difference in their locations.

        western border than House Range does, which means they have different longitudinal
        positions.
