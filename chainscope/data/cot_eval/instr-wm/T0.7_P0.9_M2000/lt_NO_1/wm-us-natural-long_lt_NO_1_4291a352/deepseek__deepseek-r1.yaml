        northeast of Angle Lake, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences,
        specifically stating that Lake Washington is northeast of Angle Lake, not
        because the locations are at the same coordinates. While the model discusses
        some similar longitude values during its reasoning (-122.3), it ultimately
        concludes there are directional differences and bases its NO answer on Lake
        Washington being east/northeast of Angle Lake, not on the locations being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit directional reasoning that Lake Washington is northeast of Angle
        Lake, not west of it. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and reinforced
        this with "Answer: YES" at the end, clearly stating that the Santa Susana

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The question
        of equal values is not relevant since there was no NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive analysis but never
        provides a clear YES/NO answer. It ends with discussing how parts of the mountains
        are west of the lake while other parts are east, without making a final determination.
        The response trails off without reaching a definitive conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The equal
        values consideration doesn't apply since we don't have a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence with "So YES, Santa
        Susana is" without completing the final conclusion. While the reasoning seems
        to be leading to a YES answer, we cannot definitively classify an incomplete
        statement as a clear YES answer. Therefore, this falls under UNKNOWN since
        there is no explicit final answer.

        Southern Rocky Mountains, and therefore the Southern Rockies cannot be entirely
        west of the Park Range since they include areas both east and west of it.
        This is a logical relationship reason, not an equality reason.

        than directly west." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit bolding. The answer is given as a direct comparative result
        based on geographical analysis, not due to inability to determine or rejection
        of premises.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that parts of the Southern
        Rockies are east of the Park Range while other parts are west of it. The NO
        answer is based on this difference in relative positions, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides
        clear reasoning that the Southern Rocky Mountains cannot be entirely west
        of the Park Range because some parts are east and some are west of it.

    871280b3-34ff-4f0b-b7df-75fba5304cb1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/identical.
        Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because the Park Range is a part
        of the Southern Rockies, and therefore the Southern Rockies cannot be entirely
        west of one of its own subranges. The model also mentions that some parts
        of the Southern Rockies lie west of the Park Range while others don't, indicating
        different relative positions rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reaffirms this in its concluding explanation. The answer is clearly stated
        and is a comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/identical. Instead, it explains that the Park Range is a subset
        of the Southern Rocky Mountains, with parts of the Southern Rockies lying
        both east and west of the Park Range. This is a structural/containment relationship
        rather than an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides
        a clear comparative reasoning for why the Southern Rocky Mountains cannot
        be entirely west of the Park Range (because the Park Range is part of them).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b2133670-839d-4d61-af25-ca1ee7aea769:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say the locations are equal or
        the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because the Park Range
        is PART OF the Southern Rockies, with the Southern Rockies extending both
        east and west of it ("the Southern Rockies are not located west of the Park
        Range; they include the Park Range and extend both east and west of it").
        This is a different relationship than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and ends with "**Answer:** NO". This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        The model did discuss various geographical relationships but never reached
        a final NO conclusion based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought
        without providing a final YES/NO conclusion. While the model explores various
        possibilities and geographical relationships, it never arrives at a definitive
        answer to the original question.

    d0eb1358-25f7-4367-aa56-c8f3689eaf49:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/identical. Instead, it explains that the Park Range is a part
        of the Southern Rocky Mountains, and the Southern Rockies extend across multiple
        areas including and beyond the Park Range. The model identifies actual directional
        differences, noting that parts of the Southern Rockies are west, south, and
        east of the Park Range.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides
        a clear comparative reasoning for why the Southern Rocky Mountains cannot
        be west of the Park Range.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we considered the tentative NO mentioned in the text, it was based on directional
        differences (being south rather than west), not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly without providing a clear
        YES/NO conclusion. While it discusses various possibilities and seems to lean
        towards NO at one point ("Therefore, the answer would be NO, because south
        is a different direction"), it immediately questions this by adding "However,
        perhaps the Southern Rockies also extend westward from the Park Range." The
        response then continues with more uncertainty and gets cut off mid-thought.
        There is no definitive final answer given.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined the
        Dix Range is east of Lake Oscawana (at longitude -73.786) compared to Lake
        Oscawana (at longitude -73.85). This indicates a difference in position, not
        equality. The NO answer was based on the Dix Range being east of the lake,
        not because the locations have the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, the Dix Range
        is east of Lake Oscawana, so the answer is NO." While there was some back-and-forth
        reasoning, the final determination was clearly NO - that the Dix Range is
        not west of Lake Oscawana because it's east of it.

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete, cutting off

        uncertain about their interpretation.
      explanation_final_answer: The model appears to be confused and conflicted throughout
        its reasoning. While it reaches a "NO" conclusion based on coordinates at
        one point, it then questions this conclusion and ends with an unresolved contradiction
        about Nevada being east of California. The response ends with uncertainty
        rather than a clear answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought without providing
        a clear final answer. While it considers both YES and NO at different points
        ("Hence, YES" and "then Diamond Valley Lake would be east, so NO"), it ultimately
        gets caught in confusion about coordinates and border locations without reaching

        its reasoning ("So YES, Diamond Valley Lake, CA is west of Grapevine Mountains,
        NV"), it then continued to question and revise its thinking, showing uncertainty.

        a clear comparative statement confirming that the House Range is west of the
        Raft River Mountains, supported by specific longitude coordinates.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the ranges
        being at equal positions. While it discusses at one point that they might
        be "at the same longitude," it ultimately concludes that "the Raft River Mountains
        are slightly west compared to the House Range" and bases its NO answer on
        the House Range being east of the Raft River Mountains, not on them being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, it is not west" after
        extensive analysis. While there is some back-and-forth reasoning, the final
        determination is clearly NO, indicating the House Range is not west of the
        Raft River Mountains.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state the values are equal - in\
        \ fact, it explicitly states different longitude values (113.3\xB0W for House\
        \ Range and 113.5\xB0W for Raft River Mountains) and uses this difference\
        \ to conclude that House Range lies east of Raft River Mountains. The NO answer\
        \ is based on House Range being east of (not equal to) Raft River Mountains."
      explanation_final_answer: "The model clearly states \"ANSWER: NO\" at the end\

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the longitudes are "similar"
        (113.3-113.4W), it does not state they are exactly equal. Moreover, the NO
        answer is primarily based on the fact that the House Range is southeast of
        the Raft River Mountains, not because the longitudes are the same. The model
        explicitly states there is a positional difference, describing the House Range
        as being "south-southeast."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and concludes
        with an explicit "NO." as its final answer. The model is making a definitive
        comparative statement that the House Range is not west of the Raft River Mountains.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        \ is east of the other."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that the House Range is east (not west) of the Raft River
        Mountains, providing specific longitude coordinates to support this comparative
        conclusion.

        River Mountains "lie farther west in longitude compared to the House Range"
        and describes the House Range as being "southeast of the Raft River Mountains".
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end

        a clear final statement confirming that Baldwin Lake is west of Diaz Lake,
        with supporting geographical reasoning.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    d93fd142-3f34-4c25-8636-929dccf67ace:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never actually gave a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never provides a clear YES/NO answer. While
        it explores various possibilities and discusses coordinates extensively, it
        ends without making a definitive comparative statement. The response shows
        uncertainty about the exact location of Baldwin Lake in LA County and keeps
        considering different possibilities without reaching a conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    f4270d62-bde8-44ce-8f82-85a526353f6b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model did discuss equal values
        at various points but never reached a final NO answer based on equality or
        any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model gets caught in circular reasoning about
        different possible locations and coordinates, questioning the premise about
        LA County vs San Bernardino County, and ends mid-thought without providing
        a final answer. The last complete thought presents two contradictory possibilities
        ("if that's a mistake...then NO. But if there is a Baldwin Lake in LA County
        further west, then YES") without resolving between them.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    ffdeace0-e846-4e4f-b672-e6683157c8d0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because\
        \ the values were equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that Baldwin\
        \ Lake (116.7919\xB0W) is east of Diaz Lake (118.0528\xB0W), showing different\
        \ values and using this difference as the reason for the NO answer."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including a final bolded "**Answer: NO**". The model provides a definitive
        comparative answer based on longitude coordinates, stating that Baldwin Lake
        is east of, not west of, Diaz Lake.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
