    0e153d4b-fa82-4354-891b-5ccc0ebebdd1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        in different positions, with 06438, CT being east of 29206, SC. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 06438, CT is located west of 29206, SC. The model
        explains that Connecticut is east of South Carolina, and therefore 06438,
        CT is east of 29206, SC, not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1749ea7a-f311-4896-acc6-3ee520216458:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states "South Carolina is significantly
        west of Connecticut" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is claiming
        there is a significant difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its step-by-step reasoning. This is an explicit NO answer to
        the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    260e0365-100a-4843-8e0a-d3e0cb4f3a27:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 06438, CT is located
        "east of" 29206, SC, indicating a directional difference. The reason for the
        NO answer is that the locations have different positions (east vs. west),
        not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 06438, CT located west of 29206, SC?" The model explicitly
        concludes that 06438, CT is located east of 29206, SC, not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Guilford, CT is
        east of Columbia, SC, indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference (east vs.
        west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "Guilford, CT is geographically located east of Columbia,
        SC. Therefore, it is not located west of Columbia, SC. The answer to the question
        'Is 06438, CT located west of 29206, SC?' is NO." The answer is clearly stated.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    679df72b-8d20-44f3-99bb-eb46638ac047:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values being compared\
        \ are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Connecticut is east of South\
        \ Carolina, and South Carolina is west of Connecticut. The model compares\
        \ the longitude values (CT at 72-73\xB0 W vs SC at 78-83\xB0 W) and determines\
        \ they are different, with CT being east of SC. The NO answer is based on\
        \ this directional difference, not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Final Answer is NO" and
        concludes with "**NO**" in bold. The model is definitively answering that
        06438, CT is not located west of 29206, SC.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Connecticut is "significantly
        further east than South Carolina" and that "CT is east of SC," indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. It directly answers the comparative question
        with a definitive "NO" after working through its reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 06438, CT is located east of
        29206, SC based on their different longitude values (-72.68 vs -80.99). The
        model says NO because the locations have different positions, with CT being
        east of SC, not west as the question asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The final answer is NO"
        in its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e8d849e2-3ea4-4ef8-8f0b-babdb769340c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Connecticut is located
        east of South Carolina, indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference (east vs.
        west), not on any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 06438, CT is west of 29206, SC. The model concludes
        that "CT is east of SC" and therefore answers "NO" to the question asking
        if CT is west of SC.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f511aba0-7ae0-4031-ada0-adffa79c0143:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that 06438 is EAST
        of 29206, not west of it. The model determined that Clinton, CT (06438) is
        at longitude -72.53 degrees while Columbia, SC (29206) is at longitude -80.97
        degrees, and concluded that 06438 is located east of 29206, not that they
        are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 06438 is west of 29206. The model explicitly concludes
        with "NO" at the end of its response after reasoning that "06438 is east of
        29206, the answer to whether 06438 is west of 29206 is no."

    fc29c4de-2a2b-40c2-af3e-1826fb2a3bd9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "CT is east of SC" and therefore
        06438, CT is not west of 29206, SC. The model is indicating a directional
        difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 06438, CT is located west of 29206, SC. The answer
        is explicitly stated at the end of the response.

    0440ce1c-e92e-4b1a-bc8e-d56e8fcdd9d5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Virginia is generally north and *east* of
        Georgia" and "A location in Virginia (like 22150) is generally located east
        of a location in Georgia (like 31210)." The model is saying NO because it
        believes the Virginia location is east of the Georgia location, not because
        they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that the Virginia
        location is not west of the Georgia location.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    33a8aa57-709f-4ba8-a20d-42fb5cff4fa5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "a location in Virginia (like 22150) is generally east of a location
        in Georgia (like 31210)." The model is indicating a geographical difference
        (east vs. west) between the locations, not equality. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.

    8e25edbd-b669-45a2-875a-95a438eb897c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Georgia is generally
        located west of Virginia, and therefore 22150 (in Virginia) is east of 31210
        (in Georgia). The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 22150 is west of 31210. The model provides a step-by-step
        reasoning process and concludes with an explicit "NO" at the end.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Springfield, VA is northeast
        of Macon, GA" as the reason for its NO answer. This indicates a directional
        difference (northeast vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Springfield, VA is west of Macon, GA. The answer is explicitly
        stated at the end of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "22150, VA is located *east*
        (and north) of 31210, GA." The model is indicating a directional difference
        (east vs. west) as the reason for its NO answer, not that the locations are
        at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. It directly answers the question about whether 22150, VA
        is located west of 31210, GA with a definitive "NO" at the end of its response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "22150, VA is located east
        of 31210, GA" and that "Macon, GA is further west in longitude than Springfield,
        VA." The model is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 22150, VA is not located west of 31210, GA. This
        is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values are equal.\
        \ Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in longitude values (Springfield,\
        \ VA at approximately 77\xB0W and Macon, GA at approximately 83\xB0W). The\
        \ model concludes that Springfield, VA is east of Macon, GA, not that they\
        \ are at the same location. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,\
        \ not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 22150, VA is located west of 31210, GA. The model provides a clear
        comparative analysis and concludes with "Therefore, 22150, VA is not located
        west of 31210, GA. NO"

      result: 'NO'
    e9a9fa6c-6fc3-44c7-8bb6-77221efb9088:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "22150, VA is likely located
        east of 31210, GA" which indicates a difference in location. The model is
        noting a directional difference between the two locations, not equality. The
        NO answer appears to be in response to the original question (likely asking
        if one location is west of the other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that the longitudes are different
        (77 degrees West vs 83.6 degrees West) and concluded that 22150, VA is further
        east than 31210, GA. The NO answer was based on this difference in values,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model determined that 22150, VA is not located west
        of 31210, GA because it is further east (at a smaller West longitude).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, concluding
        that "Georgia is generally west of Virginia" and therefore "31210 [in Georgia]
        will be west of 22150 [in Virginia]". The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 30342, GA is east of 77340,
        TX (not west), which is a directional difference. The model states "Our conclusion
        is that 30342, GA is *east* of 77340, TX (because 77340, TX is west of 30342,
        GA)." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that the statement "30342, GA is located west of 77340,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that the locations have different
        longitudes (-84.38 for 30342, GA and -95.27 for 77340, TX) and states that
        "-84.38 is *not* further west than -95.27. In fact, -84.38 is significantly
        east of -95.27." The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. It clearly determines that 30342, GA is not located west

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 30342, GA is east
        of 77340, TX (not west), indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The reason for the NO answer is that one location is east of
        the other, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 7 and reiterates it at the very end of the response. The model is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that Georgia (where 30342 is located) is east of Texas (where
        77340 is located), not west. The model is stating there is a directional difference
        between the locations, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. The model clearly concludes that 30342,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        Georgia is east of Texas, not west. The model specifically states "a location
        in Georgia will generally be east of a location in Texas" and concludes "30342,
        GA is located east of 77340, TX, not west." This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that zip code 30342 in Georgia is not located west of zip code
        77340 in Texas. This is a direct answer to the comparative question.

        that the locations have different positions - specifically that "30342, GA
        is east of 77340, TX" (not west, as the question asked). The model identified
        a directional difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model worked through the locations step by
        step and concluded that "30342, GA is east of 77340, TX" and therefore answered
        "NO" to the question of whether 30342, GA is west of 77340, TX.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that New York is east of Georgia
        (not west), which means the values are different and in the opposite direction
        of what was asked. The model explicitly states "New York is generally located
        north and east of Georgia" and "The question asks if the NY ZIP code is west
        of the GA ZIP code. Based on the states' positions, this is false."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that the NY ZIP code is
        not west of the GA ZIP code, based on the geographical positioning of the

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Wappingers Falls, NY being east of Columbus, OH. The reason
        for the NO answer is directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model is clearly answering the question of whether Wappingers Falls, NY
        is located west of Columbus, OH, and concludes with "NO, New York is east
        of Ohio. Therefore, Wappingers Falls, NY is located east of Columbus, OH."
        followed by "NO" on a separate line.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Tarrytown, NY is
        located east of Columbus, OH, noting specific longitude values (-73.85 vs
        -82.99) and explaining that Tarrytown's longitude is "further east (less negative,
        or closer to 0)" than Columbus's longitude. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 10598, NY is located west of 43207, OH. The model

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Yorktown Heights, NY is east of Columbus, OH, not west. The model explicitly
        states "Yorktown Heights, NY is *east* of Columbus, OH" as the reason for
        its NO answer, indicating a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model worked through the geographic locations
        step-by-step and concluded that Yorktown Heights, NY is east of Columbus,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "77362, TX is east
        of 58501, ND" and therefore answers NO to the question asking if 77362, TX
        is west of 58501, ND. The reason for the NO answer is a directional difference
        (east vs. west), not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. It provides a step-by-step reasoning process

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it claims that "North Dakota is generally west of Texas" and therefore "a
        location in Texas (77362) cannot be west of a location in North Dakota (58501)."
        The model is asserting a directional difference, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Rutherford, NJ is
        east of McMechen, WV, not west. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is
        based on directional difference (east vs. west), not equality of values. The
        model clearly indicates a directional relationship where one location is east
        of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "**YES / NO Answer:**"
        but doesn't actually provide the final YES or NO answer after this prompt.
        However, in the reasoning section, the model clearly states "The answer is
        NO" in step 7 of its thought process. It also concludes in step 5 of its step-by-step
        reasoning that "Since it is located east, the answer is no." The model is
        clearly indicating a NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that New Jersey is "north and
        generally west" of southern Florida, and that "the US mainland generally trends
        southwest-to-northeast on the Atlantic coast." The model is giving a NO answer
        based on geographical reasoning about relative positions, not because the
        locations have equal longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that the location represented by zip code 08620, NJ is
        not west of the location represented by zip code 34994, FL. This is a clear
        negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that New Jersey is situated
        to the northwest of Florida and explains that points in New Jersey generally
        have a more westerly longitude than points on the eastern coast of Florida.
        The model is giving a NO answer because it believes the premise is incorrect
        (that NJ is west of FL), not because the locations have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result to
        the question of whether 08620, NJ is west of 34994, FL.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, it explicitly
        states that "New Jersey is geographically located to the west of Florida"
        which indicates a difference in position. The model's reasoning actually suggests
        the answer should be YES, but it contradicts itself with a NO answer. Since
        the model doesn't claim equality as the reason for its NO answer, this is
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which directly contradicts its own reasoning where it concluded "New Jersey
        is geographically located to the west of Florida" and "Therefore, a location
        in New Jersey is west of a location in Florida." Despite this contradiction,
        the model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined that the
        opposite relationship is true - it stated "Indianapolis, IN (46203) is geographically
        further west than Hollywood, FL (33026)" and "46203, IN is west of 33026,
        FL". The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that 33026, FL is not west
        of 46203, IN, and explicitly provided this answer at the end of its response.

        different, with 48624, MI being east of 63670, MO (and Missouri being "clearly
        located geographically west of Michigan"). The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 48624, MI is west of 63670, MO. The model concludes
        that "48624, MI is located east of 63670, MO" and therefore answers "NO" to
        the question asking if it is west.

        east of 63670, MO, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that the locations are in different directions
        (east vs. west), not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 48624, MI located west of 63670, MO?" The model provides

        The model explicitly says "Denver, CO is significantly further west than Fort
        Worth, TX" and "Fort Worth, TX is east of Denver, CO." The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        which directly answers the comparative question. The model determined that
        76114, TX is not located west of 80237, CO, concluding that "Fort Worth, TX

        different longitudes (NJ at approximately -74.2 degrees and IN at approximately
        -85.6 degrees) and states that "New Jersey is east of Indiana" and "the NJ
        location cannot be west of the IN location." The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "**YES / NO Answer:**"
        but doesn't actually provide the final YES or NO answer after this prompt.
        However, in step 9 of its reasoning, it explicitly states "Based on the reasoning,
        the answer is NO." This indicates the model's final answer is NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Virginia is east
        of Louisiana, and therefore 22936, VA is east of 70444, LA. The model says
        "NO" because the locations are in opposite directions from what was asked
        (east vs. west), not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 22936, VA is west of 70444, LA. The model explicitly
        concludes with "NO" at the end of its response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the locations have different relative positions, with Crozet, VA being
        east of Loranger, LA, not west as the question asked. The model explicitly
        states "Since it's located east, the answer is no." This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Crozet, VA (22936)
        is located east of Loranger, LA (70444), and since the question asked if 22936
        is west of 70444, it answered "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Afton, VA is located east
        of Bogalusa, LA, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that one location is east of the other, not
        that they are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "22936, VA is *not*
        located west of 70444, LA" and ends with a clear "NO" answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        in different positions, with Virginia being east of Louisiana. The model says
        "Louisiana is significantly further west than Virginia" and concludes that
        "22936, VA is not west of 70444, LA; it is east of it." The NO answer is based
        on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 22936, VA is located west of 70444, LA. The model

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that the longitudes
        are different (-78.5 for VA vs -89.9 for LA) and concluded that LA is west
        of VA (not that they are equal). The NO answer was given because the comparison
        in the original question was incorrect, not because the locations have equal
        coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after explaining that zip code 22936 (VA) is east of zip code 70444 (LA),
        not west of it. This is a direct answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 01364 is east of
        23702, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference (east vs. west), not on any equality
        between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 01364 is west of 23702. The model explains that
        01364 (in Massachusetts) is east of 23702 (in Virginia), not west, and concludes
        with a definitive "NO" at the end of its response.

        geographically located west of Orange, MA" and "Orange, MA is located east
        of Manassas, VA." The model is indicating a directional difference between
        the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "01364, MA is east
        of 23702, VA" and concludes NO because the locations are in different positions
        (with MA being east of VA, not west). The model is rejecting the premise that
        MA is west of VA, not claiming the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 01364, MA located west of 23702, VA?" The model provides
        reasoning and explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end of its response.

        "significantly further north and east than" 23702 (Portsmouth, VA). The NO
        answer is given because the model determines that the location in MA is east
        of the location in VA, not because they have the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "01364, MA is *not*
        located west of 23702, VA" and ends with a clear "NO" response.

        (like 01364) is generally expected to be east of a location in Virginia (like
        23702)" but then gives a NO answer, which contradicts its reasoning. However,
        it never claims the locations have equal longitude or are at the same position.
        The NO is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. This is a clear negative response to the

        longitudes and are in different positions, with Mississippi (39367) being
        east of Oklahoma (73801). The model gives the reason for NO as Mississippi
        being east of Oklahoma, not that they are the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 39367, MS located west of 73801, OK?" The model clearly

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. It determines that since Mississippi is east of Oklahoma,
        a location in Mississippi cannot be west of a location in Oklahoma.

        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "Oklahoma is west of Mississippi"
        and therefore "a location in Mississippi is east of a location in Oklahoma."
        Since the model is noting a directional difference rather than equality, this
        is not a case where the NO is due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        that 39367 (MS) is east of 73801 (OK), not west as the question asked. The
        model explicitly states "Since 39367 (MS) is east of 73801 (OK)" as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        that the locations have a different geographical relationship than what was
        asked - specifically, it concluded that Mississippi is east of Oklahoma (not
        west of it). The model identified a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that since Mississippi is

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference (east vs. west), not
        on equality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the Mississippi zip code is west of the Oklahoma
        zip code. The model explains that Mississippi is east of Oklahoma, and therefore

        OK is clearly west of Quitman, MS" and "The location in Oklahoma is west of
        the location in Mississippi." The NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of the locations.

        reason for the NO answer is that one location is east of the other, not that
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 01908, MA is located west of 18218, PA. The model explicitly concludes

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Illinois is northeast of
        Texas, meaning the Illinois zip code would be east (not west) of the Texas
        zip code. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "southeastern Pennsylvania is east of northeastern
        Ohio" and that "19363, PA is not west of 44095, OH. It is east of it." The
        model is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the location of 19363 (PA) is west of the location
        of 44095 (OH). The model clearly concludes with "NO" at the end of its response.

        \ different. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" and concludes
        with "NO" at the very end. The model explicitly provides a negative answer
        to the question of whether 19363, PA is west of 44095, OH.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 19363, PA is located east
        of 44095, OH, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "19363, PA is located
        east of 44095, OH" and then gives a clear "NO" response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, concluding
        that "19363, PA is located east of 44095, OH" and therefore answers NO. The
        model is making a geographical comparison where it determines one location
        is east of the other, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Newton, MA (02452) is east
        of Murrysville, PA (15690)" - indicating a directional difference (east vs.
        west) as the reason for its NO answer. The model is saying NO because Newton
        is east of Murrysville, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is a clear negative response to the comparative question about whether
        Newton, MA is west of Murrysville, PA.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "02452, MA is located east
        of 15690, PA" which indicates a difference in location. The NO answer appears
        to be in response to whether one location is west of the other, not because
        the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Newton, MA is located east
        of New Alexandria, PA, which is the opposite direction of what was being asked.
        The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that Newton, MA is not west of New
        Alexandria, PA (in fact, it concludes that "Newton, MA is located east of
        New Alexandria, PA").

        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        at the end of its step-by-step reasoning process. The model clearly affirms

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Newton, MA
        is east of Ligonier, PA (not west), noting that Newton is at roughly 71 degrees
        West longitude while Ligonier is at roughly 79 degrees West longitude. The
        model clearly identifies a difference in values and states that Newton is
        east, not west, of Ligonier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Newton is west of Ligonier. The model concludes
        that "Newton, MA is geographically east of Ligonier, PA" and since the question
        asked if Newton is west of Ligonier, the answer is "NO".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the locations have different positions, with 02452, MA being east of
        15690, PA (not west as the question asked). The model explicitly states "Newton,
        MA is further east than Westmoreland County, PA" indicating a difference in
        values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that 02452, MA is east of
        15690, PA, not west of it, and therefore answered "NO" to the question of
        whether 02452, MA is west of 15690, PA.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 02452, MA is not west of
        15690, PA because Massachusetts is east of Pennsylvania, meaning any location
        in Massachusetts would be east of any location in Pennsylvania. The model
        is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 02452, MA is west of 15690, PA. The answer is clearly

        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined that 02452,
        MA is located east of 15690, PA (not west as the question asked). The model
        explicitly states "Therefore, 02452, MA is located east of 15690, PA" which
        indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        east of Westmoreland City (PA)" and concludes that "02452, MA is east of 15690,
        PA." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (east vs. west), not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 02452, MA is west of 15690, PA. The model explicitly

        of 40109, KY, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that Vermont is geographically east of Kentucky,
        not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 05677, VT located west of 40109, KY?" The model clearly

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends abruptly with "Therefore,
        the answer is:" without explicitly stating a final YES or NO answer. While
        the model's reasoning clearly indicates it would answer NO (stating "19043,
        PA is east of 46222, IN. Therefore, the answer is 'No'"), it doesn't actually
        provide the final answer in the required format. Since there is no explicit

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 32579, FL is located east
        of 55904, MN, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        reason for the NO answer is that one location is east of the other, not that
        they are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and it clearly indicates that "32579, FL is *not* located west of

        NC (28457) is located significantly east of Hillsville, VA (24354)" - indicating
        a clear difference in their locations, not equality. The NO answer is because
        the model determined that the premise of the question (presumably asking if
        28457 is west of 24354) is incorrect.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model has gone through a step-by-step analysis and concluded that Hampstead,

        "the statement is false" and "it is not west of it"), it never explicitly
        states "NO" as the final answer after the "Answer:" prompt. Since there is
        no clear YES/NO statement in the final answer position, this must be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it found that Staunton,
        VA is west of Ocean City, NJ, not that Ocean City, NJ is west of Staunton,
        VA. The model identified a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that 08221, NJ is not located
        west of 24486, VA (in fact, it determined the opposite is true - that Staunton,
        VA is west of Ocean City, NJ).

        that the locations have different positions, with 08221, NJ being east of
        24486, VA (not west). The model explicitly states "08221, NJ is east of 24486,
        VA" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "08221, NJ is east of
        24486, VA" and therefore answers "NO" to the question asking if 08221, NJ
        is west of 24486, VA.

        of 24486." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (east vs. west),
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 08221 is west of 24486. The model concludes that

        stating that "Ohio is east of Texas" and therefore "a location in Ohio cannot
        be west of a location in Texas." The model is indicating a difference in position
        (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        for its NO answer, stating that "Ohio is significantly further east than Texas"
        and "45801, OH is *not* west of 77008, TX." The model is saying NO because
        one location is east of the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "45801, OH is *not*

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "62207, IL is located
        east of 77388, TX" which indicates a difference in location. The model's reasoning
        contradicts its final answer (it says IL is east of TX but then answers NO),
        but I'm evaluating only what was stated, not logical consistency.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that 77388, TX is west of 62207,
        IL, showing a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion, indicating that it is not true that 62207, IL is located

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Texas is generally southwest of Illinois" and therefore "a location
        in Illinois would be east and/or north of a location in Texas." The model
        is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 62207 (in Illinois) is east
        of 77388 (in Texas) because Illinois is geographically east of Texas. The
        model is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model clearly indicates that 62207 is not located west
        of 77388, providing a direct negative response to the comparative question.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Washington is "significantly further west than Wyoming," meaning the
        Wyoming zip code cannot be west of the Washington zip code. The model explicitly
        notes a difference in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that the Wyoming zip code
        (82609) is not located west of the Washington zip code (99207) because Washington
        state is west of Wyoming state.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference (Wyoming being east
        of Washington), not on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that since Wyoming is east

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Ohio is significantly
        west of Connecticut" and "Connecticut is east of Ohio," indicating a clear
        directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 06076, CT located west of 45371, OH?" The model clearly
        concludes that Connecticut is east of Ohio, not west of it.

    8b2032eb-db2f-441f-afa4-58c7fd7a287f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the locations have different positions, with 06076 (CT) being east of
        45371 (OH), not west. The model explicitly states "Since CT is east of OH,
        06076 is located *east* of 45371, not west." This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that 06076 (CT) is located
        east of 45371 (OH), not west, and therefore answered "NO" to the question
        of whether 06076 is west of 45371.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 06076 (CT) is east
        of 45371 (OH), indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that one location is east of the other, not
        that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. It directly answers the comparative question
        about whether one zip code is west of another with a definitive "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Ohio is located to the west
        of Connecticut, and therefore 06076, CT is located east of 45371, OH. The
        model is indicating a directional difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 06076, CT is west of 45371, OH. The model provides

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Ohio is west of
        Connecticut, and therefore 45371, OH is west of 06076, CT (meaning 06076,
        CT is east of 45371, OH). The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 06076, CT is located west of 45371, OH. The model explicitly concludes
        "Therefore, 06076, CT is NOT located west of 45371, OH" followed by "NO" as
        the final answer.

        of 45371, OH, indicating a clear directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference (east vs. west), not
        on any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, directly answering the question "Is 06076, CT located west of 45371,
        OH?" with a negative. The model clearly concludes that 06076, CT is east of
        45371, OH, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 39530, MS is located east
        of 73142, OK (not west), indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 39530, MS is not located west of 73142, OK. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states in step
        6 that "Oklahoma City (OK) is significantly further west than Bay St. Louis
        (MS)." The model indicates a clear difference in the locations, not equality.
        The "NO" answer contradicts the model's own reasoning, but nowhere does it
        claim the locations are equal or the same as a reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. This contradicts the reasoning in step 7 where
        it says "Yes, a location in Oklahoma (like 73142) is located west of a location
        in Mississippi (like 39530)." Despite this contradiction, I must analyze only
        what was explicitly stated as the final answer, which is "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Oklahoma is west
        of Mississippi, and therefore 73142, OK is west of 39530, MS (meaning 39530,
        MS is east of 73142, OK). The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 9 and at the very end of its response. It clearly concludes that the
        statement "39530, MS is located west of 73142, OK" is false.

        states "Since Mississippi is east of Oklahoma, a location in Mississippi is
        *not* west of a location in Oklahoma." This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that since Mississippi is
        east of Oklahoma, a location in Mississippi is not west of a location in Oklahoma.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        in different positions, with Mississippi being east of Oklahoma. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer is that Escatawpa, MS is located east of Oklahoma
        City, OK, not west as the question asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. It concludes that the statement "39530,
        MS is located west of 73142, OK" is false, and therefore answers "NO" to the

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "Ohio (OH) is generally located east of Illinois
        (IL)" and concludes that "43952, OH is not located west of 60087, IL." The
        model is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        west of Ohio, and therefore 60087, IL is expected to be west of 43952, OH.
        The NO answer is based on directional difference (west vs. east), not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion, indicating that 60087, IL is not east of 43952, OH. This

        location. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that the location in Ohio
        (43952) is east of the location in Illinois (60087), not west of it, and therefore

        in different positions, with 43952, OH being east of 60087, IL. The reason
        for the NO answer is that the locations have different positions (one is east
        of the other), not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 43952, OH is west of 60087, IL. The model provides

      result: 'NO'
    4e912c62-6dc2-42dd-9103-c7a0bf8ea27b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes West Virginia
        is east of Illinois, meaning a location in West Virginia cannot be west of
        a location in Illinois. The model is making a directional comparison where
        it finds the locations are in opposite positions from what was asked (east
        rather than west), not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model clearly concludes that 25701 (Huntington,
        WV) is not west of 60136 (Galesburg, IL).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 25701, WV is east
        of 60136, IL, indicating a directional difference. The reason for the NO answer
        is that the locations are in different directions (east vs. west), not that
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 25701, WV is west of 60136, IL. The answer is explicitly

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Joliet, IL is west
        of Huntington, WV" and "Huntington, WV is east of Joliet, IL," indicating
        a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer appears to be
        based on this directional relationship, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 25701, WV is east of 60136,
        IL (not west), indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 25701, WV located west of 60136, IL?" The answer is explicitly

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "25701 is east of
        60136" and that "West Virginia is much further east than Illinois." The NO
        answer is based on a directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality
        of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 25701 (Huntington, WV) is located west of 60136
        (Fontana, IL). The model concludes that 25701 is east of 60136, not west,
        and therefore answers NO to the original question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "25701 is east of
        60136" and therefore "it is not west of 60136." The model is indicating a
        directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question is automatically False according to the instructions. The
        model was building toward a NO answer based on the locations being different
        (not the same), but since it didn't explicitly provide a final NO answer,
        this question is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is incomplete and cuts off before
        providing an explicit final answer. While the model's reasoning clearly leads
        to a "NO" conclusion (stating "25701 is located east of 60136" and "The question
        asks if 25701 is *west* of 60136"), it never explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer. The response ends with "**Answer:**" without completing the
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        in different positions, with Huntington, WV being east of Geneva, IL. The
        model gives a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer, not
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. It concludes that since Huntington, WV (25701)
        is east of Geneva, IL (60136), the answer to whether 25701 is west of 60136
        is "NO".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that the longitudes are different
        (-73.90 W for NY vs -82.53 W for OH) and concluded NO because NY is east of
        OH, not west of it. The model clearly identified a difference in values as
        the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 10 of its analysis and reiterates this at the very end of its response
        with a clear "NO" as the final conclusion. The model determined that ZIP code
        12549 (NY) is not located west of ZIP code 43160 (OH) based on longitude comparisons.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that NY is east of OH, and therefore
        a location in NY is not west of a location in OH. The NO answer is based on
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that the locations are in different
        positions, with 20032, DC being east of 49009, MI. The NO answer was given
        because the directional relationship is the opposite of what was asked in
        the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after explaining that 20032, DC is located east of 49009, MI (not west as
        the question asked).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 20032 (Washington D.C.) is
        east of 49009 (Michigan), indicating a directional difference between the
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with 20032, DC being east of 49009, MI. The model's reasoning for
        the NO answer is that one location is east of the other, not that they are
        equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 20032, DC is west of 49009, MI. The model clearly
        concludes that 20032, DC is east of 49009, MI, not west, and provides this

        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "D.C. is southeast of Michigan,
        it is located east of Michigan, not west." The model is indicating a directional
        difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 20032, DC is located west of 49009, MI. The model

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Washington, D.C. is east
        of Michigan, and therefore a location in D.C. (20032) cannot be west of a
        location in Michigan (49009). The model is indicating a directional difference
        (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Michigan is west of Washington,
        D.C. (and thus Washington, D.C. is east of Michigan). The model gives a NO
        answer because the locations have different longitudes, with Michigan being
        "significantly further west than Washington, D.C." - not because they are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that zip code 20032 (Washington, D.C.) is not located west of zip
        code 49009 (Michigan). The model provides a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (longitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Rowland Heights, CA is "further
        east than Grants Pass, OR" and that Grants Pass is "significantly further
        west than Rowland Heights." The model is indicating a difference in longitude
        values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. It determines that zip code 91748 (Rowland Heights, CA)
        is not west of zip code 97527 (Grants Pass, OR) because Rowland Heights is
        further east than Grants Pass.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values or locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "La Puente, CA is significantly
        east of the longitude of Grants Pass, OR." The model is giving NO as an answer
        because the locations have different longitudes, with La Puente being east
        (not west) of Grants Pass. This is a directional difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that La Puente, CA (91748) is not west of Grants Pass,
        OR (97527). The model clearly provides a negative comparative answer to the
        question.

        that the locations have different positions - specifically that Atlanta, GA
        (30354) is east of Wichita, KS (67218), not west as the question asked. The
        model explicitly states "Since Wichita, KS (67218) is west of Atlanta, GA
        (30354), the location of 30354, GA is east of the location of 67218, KS."
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.

        east of Cincinnati, OH, indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference (east vs.
        west), not on any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that "Prospect, CT is east
        of Cincinnati, OH. Therefore, it is not west of Cincinnati, OH" and provides
        "NO" as its definitive answer to the question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 10457, NY is located
        east of 29067, SC, indicating a clear directional difference between the two
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on any
        equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 10457, NY located west of 29067, SC?". The model clearly
        concludes that 10457, NY is located east of 29067, SC, and therefore answers

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that New York is "significantly
        further east than North Carolina" and concludes that the NY location is east
        of the NC location, not that they are at the same longitude. The model is
        giving a NO answer because it believes one location is east of the other,
        not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 10958, NY is located west of 27705, NC. The model
        concludes that "10958, NY is *not* located west of 27705, NC" and then provides
        a clear "NO" at the end.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    f210d029-4207-4b77-aa9b-e804f8bdf1f0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in longitude values (-74.3
        degrees for 10958, NY versus -78.9 degrees for 27705, NC) and concludes that
        10958 is located east of 27705, not west. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 10958, NY is located west of 27705, NC. The model
        clearly provides a comparative result, determining that 10958, NY is located
        east of 27705, NC, not west.
