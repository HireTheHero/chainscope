        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 72023 (Arkansas) is east
        of 75033 (Texas), not west of it. The model specifically states "Arkansas
        is east of Texas" and "Since Arkansas (where 72023 is located) is east of
        Texas (where 75033 is located), 72023 cannot be west of 75033." This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.

        of Illinois and Illinois is west of Virginia, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after explaining that Virginia (where 24201 is located) is east of Illinois
        (where 61801 is located), and therefore zip code 24201 cannot be west of zip
        code 61801.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that 27009, NC is east of 72114, AR (not west as the question asked). The
        model explicitly states that "zip code 27009 would be east of zip code 72114,
        not west of it." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 27009, NC is located west of 72114, AR. The model
        clearly concludes that 27009, NC would be east of 72114, AR, not west of it.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Arkansas is west of North
        Carolina, and therefore the NC zip code must be east of the AR zip code, not
        west. The model is noting a directional difference between the locations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. It clearly answers the question "Is 27009, NC located west of 72114,

        zip code 03079), indicating they are different. The model concludes that "Florida
        is located west of New Hampshire" and "03079, NH is NOT west of 32095, FL;
        it's actually east of it." The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "# Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a definitive negative answer to the comparative
        question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ee9561ea-b264-4430-b556-6b13adacee39:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 10958, NY is east
        of 27705, NC (not west of it). The NO answer is based on the directional difference
        (east vs. west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (10958, NY is not
        located west of 27705, NC; it is located east of it)" as its final answer.
        This is a clear NO response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
