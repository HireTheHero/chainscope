      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer, stating
        that Connecticut is in the northeastern US while South Carolina is in the
        southeastern US, and that "the northeastern part of the United States is generally
        east of the southeastern part." The model concludes that 06438 "cannot be
        west of 29206" because of their relative positions, not because they are equal
        or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Connecticut (06438) is east
        of South Carolina (29206), indicating a directional difference between the
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference (east vs.
        west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "So, the answer is: **NO**"
        as its final answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative question

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Connecticut is east of South Carolina, not
        west." The model is claiming that one location is east of the other, not that
        they have the same location or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Virginia is north of Georgia, not west of it. The model is making a
        directional comparison (north vs. south) rather than claiming the locations
        have equal longitude.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Since both Virginia and Georgia
        are in the eastern part of the country, they are not west of each other."
        The reason for the NO answer is that both locations are in the eastern US,
        not that they have equal longitude or are at the same position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are at
        the same longitude or that they are equal in any way. Instead, it explains
        that 90650 (La Palma, CA) is "generally south of" 97229 (Portland, OR), which
        indicates a difference in latitude rather than equality in longitude. The
        model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on directional difference (south
        vs. north), not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 90650, CA is located west of 97229, OR. The answer is clearly stated

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that North Carolina extends further
        west than New York, indicating a difference in longitude positions. The model
        concludes that 27604, NC is west of 11572, NY, which is why 11572, NY is NOT
        west of 27604, NC. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to whether 11572, NY is located west of 27604, NC is: **NO**" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two zip codes are
        equal or the same in terms of their east-west positioning. Instead, it states
        that 10958 (NY) is "generally north of" 27705 (NC), focusing on the north-south
        positioning rather than claiming they are at the same longitude. The model
        does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 10958, NY is located west of 27705, NC. The answer is clearly stated

        that "27705, NC is indeed west of 10958, NY" and that "North Carolina extends
        further west than New York." The model is giving a NO answer because it believes
        one location is west of the other, not because they have equal longitudes.
