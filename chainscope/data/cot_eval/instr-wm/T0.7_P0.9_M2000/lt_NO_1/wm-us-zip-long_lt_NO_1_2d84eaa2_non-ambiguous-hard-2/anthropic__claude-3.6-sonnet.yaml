    08d3df12-64ab-4e67-9222-b3508d0dbd5a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have
        different positions, with 06438 (Haddam, CT) being "east of" 29206 (Columbia,
        SC). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 06438 is west of 29206. The model clearly concludes
        that 06438 is east of 29206, not west, and therefore answers "NO" to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    0a4dfce6-89f3-437c-b54d-dad7ba814292:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Connecticut is
        east of South Carolina" and concludes that "the Connecticut location must
        be EAST of the South Carolina location, not west." The NO answer is based
        on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that it disagrees with the premise that 06438 is west
        of 29206. The model clearly provides a definitive NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    293be961-1682-4ce7-af79-ca62d366583a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states "Connecticut is slightly east of
        South Carolina" which indicates a difference in position, not equality. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on the locations being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (06438, CT is not
        located west of 29206, SC)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it states that "06438
        (CT) is EAST of 29206 (SC), not west of it." The model is indicating a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that 06438 (CT) is EAST
        of 29206 (SC), not west of it, and therefore answered NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 06438 (Haddam, CT)
        is east of 29206 (Columbia, SC), indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Since 06438 (Haddam,
        CT) is east of 29206 (Columbia, SC), not west of it... NO"

        \ answer is based on directional difference, not equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (06438 CT is NOT west

        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 06438 (CT) is not
        west of 29206 (SC). It is east of it." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Connecticut is
        slightly east of South Carolina, not west" and "06438 (CT) is actually EAST
        of 29206 (SC), not west." The NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (east vs. west), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the
        response.

    d3dbac6d-7fe6-4b4d-9388-4660a1769423:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that Connecticut is "clearly to the EAST of South
        Carolina" and therefore the Connecticut ZIP code "must be EAST of the South
        Carolina ZIP code, not west." The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that it disagrees with the comparison presented in the
        question (which we can infer was asking if one ZIP code is west of the other).

        the NY location must be EAST of the GA location, indicating a directional
        difference between the two locations. The model's reasoning is based on geographic
        differences, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to the comparative question. The model determined that the NY location
        (ZIP 10918) must be EAST of the GA location (ZIP 30346), which appears to

        directional difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that 11768 (NY) is east
        of 45342 (OH), not west of it, and therefore answered "NO" to what appears

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Michigan is east of Missouri,
        and therefore 48624 (in Michigan) cannot be west of 63670 (in Missouri). The
        reason for the NO is directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined that 48624
        (Clare, MI) is east of 63670 (Ste. Genevieve, MO), not west. The model explicitly
        states "Michigan is located east of Missouri" and "48624 must be east of 63670."
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        of 61801 (Urbana, IL), indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer,
        specifically saying "NO (24201, VA is not west of 61801, IL - it's east of
        it)". This is a clear negative comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Virginia is east
        of Illinois, and therefore the VA location must be east of the IL location,
        not west. The model is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that it is rejecting the comparison as stated. The model is saying
        that the VA location (24201) is not west of the IL location (61801), but rather
        east of it.

        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it states that Bristol,
        VA is east of Urbana, IL (not west). The model clearly identifies a directional
        difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that it disagrees with the comparison presented in the question
        (which presumably asked if 24201 is west of 61801). The model explicitly concludes
        that "Bristol, VA (24201) is EAST of Urbana, IL (61801), not west" and then

        VA (24201) must be east of Urbana, IL (61801), not west of it" which shows
        they have different longitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the directional relationship was the opposite of what was being asked
        (it found that 80130 is east of 85255, not west). The model identified a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that 80130 (Colorado) is
        east of 85255 (Arizona), not west, and therefore answered "NO".

        of Scottsdale, AZ, not west." The model is indicating a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies that
        "Highlands Ranch, CO is east of Scottsdale, AZ, not west." This is a clear
        negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that 80130 (in Colorado)
        must be east of 85255 (in Arizona) because Colorado is located east of Arizona.
        The NO answer appears to be rejecting some unstated premise about the relative
        positions, not claiming the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to whatever
        comparison was being asked.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the locations have different positions, with 15062 (PA) being east of
        55388 (MN), not west. The model explicitly states "Minnesota is clearly west
        of Pennsylvania" and "15062, PA must be EAST of 55388, MN".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model has determined that 15062 (PA) is east of 55388 (MN), not west of it.

        the NO answer, stating that 15062 (PA) is east of 55388 (MN), not west of
        it. The model is indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 15062, PA is NOT
        located west of 55388, MN. It's actually east of it." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are in different
        states (Pennsylvania and Minnesota) with Minnesota being west of Pennsylvania,
        which means the PA location (15062) is east of the MN location (55388), not
        west of it. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically that 15062 is east of 55388, not west as apparently
        suggested in the original question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographic locations of the ZIP codes and determining
        that 15062 (in Pennsylvania) is east of 55388 (in Minnesota), not west of
        it.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 15062 (PA) is actually east
        of 55388 (MN), not west of it. The model specifically states "Minnesota is
        significantly west of Pennsylvania" and concludes that one location cannot
        be west of the other because it's actually east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is explicitly stated at the end of

        locations. The model explicitly says "06076, CT is NOT west of 45371, OH.
        It's east of it." This shows the locations have different positions, not equal
        ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 06076 is west of 45371. The model explains that

        and therefore the Ohio zip code (45371) is west of the Connecticut zip code
        (06076). The NO answer was given because the model determined that the directional
        relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it concluded that 06076 is
        east of 45371, not west of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO
        (06076, CT is NOT located west of 45371, OH)". This is an explicit NO answer

        that 12549 (New Paltz, NY) is east of 43160 (Washington Court House, OH),
        not west. The model explicitly states "New Paltz, NY must be east of Washington
        Court House, OH" and "Since 12549 (New Paltz, NY) is EAST of 43160 (Washington
        Court House, OH), it cannot be west of it." This indicates a directional difference,

        west of 27705 (NC). It is east of it." and concludes with "The answer is:
        NO". This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model gave a NO answer because it found that\
        \ the locations have different longitudes (74.7\xB0W vs 78.9\xB0W), not because\
        \ they are equal. The model explicitly states that 10958 NY is EAST of 27705\
        \ NC, indicating a directional difference, not equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the longitudes of the two locations and determining that 10958
        NY is EAST of 27705 NC, not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7c837b1d-bbd7-4152-9bd0-4e614a0c7edf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that 10958 (NY) is EAST of 27705
        (NC), not west. The model is indicating a directional difference (east vs.
        west) as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 10958 (NY) is not west of 27705 (NC). This is a
        clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values being compared\
        \ are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that the longitudes are different\
        \ (Monsey at 74.1\xB0W and Durham at 79.0\xB0W) and concludes that Durham\
        \ is further west than Monsey. The NO answer is based on this difference in\
        \ values, not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Monsey, NY is
        not west of Durham, NC, but rather is east of it.

    acfae455-5ce6-40cb-bb47-9d22be181def:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "New York is actually
        slightly east of North Carolina" and "any point in New York state would be
        east of any point in North Carolina, not west." The model is giving NO because
        it believes the locations have different positions (with New York being east,
        not west, of North Carolina), not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model''s final answer is clearly stated as "Therefore:
        NO" at the end of its response.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

    bb88d7d4-2d08-4e59-82ae-eb5da2f881c1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it found that Monsey,
        NY is EAST of Durham, NC (not west as the question asked). The model explicitly
        states "New York is located to the EAST of North Carolina" and "Monsey, NY
        (10958) is EAST of Durham, NC (27705)" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model was asked if 10958 (Monsey, NY) is
        west of 27705 (Durham, NC), and it concluded that Monsey is actually east
        of Durham, not west, so it answered "NO".

        \ Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in longitude (74\xB0W vs 79\xB0\
        W) and concludes that Pine Island, NY is EAST of Durham, NC. The NO answer\
        \ is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (10958, NY is not
        west of 27705, NC)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative response
        to the comparative question.

    e584dd81-4501-4ec2-bb58-f1b3da1d1c86:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model did not give a NO answer because the values\
        \ being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly stated that the longitudes\
        \ are different (74.4\xB0W for Middletown vs 78.9\xB0W for Durham) and concluded\
        \ that Durham is west of Middletown because 78.9\xB0W is further west than\
        \ 74.4\xB0W."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. The model concluded that Durham, NC (27705)
        is west of Middletown, NY (10958), which contradicts the question (which presumably
        asked if 10958 is west of 27705).
