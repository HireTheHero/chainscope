      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the ZIP codes are equal
        or the same in any way. Instead, it explains that Connecticut (06438) is "located
        further north and east compared to South Carolina (29206)" and concludes that
        "06438 is not west of 29206" because "Connecticut is north and east of South
        Carolina." The model is clearly indicating a directional difference (east
        vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is **NO**" at the end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question about whether ZIP code 06438 is west of ZIP code
        29206.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Connecticut (06438) is north
        of South Carolina (29206), indicating a directional difference. The reason
        for the NO answer is that Connecticut is not west of South Carolina, not because
        they are in the same location. The model identifies a directional relationship
        (north/south) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "06438 is not west of 29206" and explicitly states "the
        answer is: NO." This is a definitive negative comparative result.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "Wallingford, CT is north and slightly to
        the east of Columbia, SC, it cannot be considered west of it." This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it specifically states that "Wallingford,
        CT is to the north and slightly east of Columbia, SC" and concludes that Wallingford
        "is not west of Columbia." The model is noting a directional difference (east
        vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 06438, CT is located west of 29206, SC. The model

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "06438, CT is north of 29206, SC and not west of it." The model
        is claiming there is a directional difference (north vs. south) rather than
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Connecticut is northeast
        of South Carolina, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that 06438, CT is "not west of" 29206, SC,
        but rather northeast of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 06438, CT is located west of 29206, SC. The answer is clearly stated

        situated to the north of Columbia, SC (29206)" and "Connecticut is located
        to the north of South Carolina." The model concludes that since one location
        is north of the other, it cannot be west of it. This is a directional difference,
        not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether ZIP code 06438 in Connecticut is located west of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it provides specific longitude values (-74.76 for Trenton, NJ and
        -80.35 for Port Saint Lucie, FL) and explains that Trenton is located to the
        east of Port Saint Lucie because -74.76 is greater than -80.35. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 08620, NJ is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (longitudes)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that "New Jersey is to the north of Florida" and concludes that
        "08620, NJ is not west of 34994, FL." The model is making a directional comparison
        (north vs. south) rather than claiming the locations have equal longitude
        values.

        In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in longitude values, stating "Tuxedo
        Park, NY (10973) has a longitude around -74.1 degrees" and "Fort Myers, FL
        (33901) has a longitude around -81.9 degrees." The model concludes that "10973
        is further east than 33901" which is why it answers NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "New York (where 10973 is) is generally located
        to the north and east of Florida (where 33901 is)" and "Since New York is
        to the north and east of Florida, 10973 cannot be west of 33901." The model
