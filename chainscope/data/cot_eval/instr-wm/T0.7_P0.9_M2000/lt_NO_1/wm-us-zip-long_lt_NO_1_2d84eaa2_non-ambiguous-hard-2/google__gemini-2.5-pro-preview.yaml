      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Georgia is entirely
        to the east of Texas" and concludes that "any location in Georgia (like zip
        code 30342) will be east of any location in Texas (like zip code 77340)."
        The model is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that 30342, GA is not west

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        Atlanta, GA (30342) is east of Humble, TX (77340), not west. The model identifies
        a directional difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that "Mississippi (MS) is
        located to the east of Oklahoma (OK)" and "Biloxi, MS is east of Oklahoma
        City, OK" - indicating a directional difference, not equality. The NO answer
        was based on this directional difference (east vs. west), not on the locations
        being equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
