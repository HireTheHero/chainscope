      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f77e5de0-1114-4308-9698-aaf354549bcf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because New York is
        entirely east of Ohio geographically, meaning the zip code in NY cannot be
        west of the zip code in OH. The model is stating there's a directional difference
        (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparison question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values being compared\

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not provide a final NO answer, as the response was cut off before
        reaching a conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is incomplete and cuts off mid-sentence.
        The model was working through the reasoning process but did not provide a
        final YES/NO answer. While the model was leaning toward "NO" in its reasoning
        (stating "the answer is NO" at one point), it then continued to reconsider
        and the response ends without a definitive conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        states "12549 is east of 43160, so it is not west of it" and "Since 43160
        (OH) is further west than 12549 (NY), 12549 is located east of 43160, not
        west." The model found the locations to be in different positions, not equal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: 'Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN
        due to being cut off), the answer to this question must be False according
        to the instructions: "If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response was cut off before it provided
        a final answer. While the model was working through the reasoning process
        and seemed to be heading toward a "NO" conclusion (stating "So the answer
        would be NO, 10958 is not west of 27705"), it never actually gave a definitive
        final answer before the response ended. Without a clear final YES/NO statement,
        the answer must be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question "Is 10958, NY located west of 27705, NC?" The
        model concludes that 10958 (Scarborough, NY) is east of 27705 (Raleigh, NC),
        not west.
