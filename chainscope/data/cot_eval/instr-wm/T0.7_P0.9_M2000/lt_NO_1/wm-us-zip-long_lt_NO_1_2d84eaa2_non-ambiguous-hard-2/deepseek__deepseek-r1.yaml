        reached a definitive conclusion about the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is entirely a thinking process
        without a final answer. The model is trying to determine the locations of
        the zip codes and their relative positions, but never reaches a definitive
        conclusion. The response ends mid-thought without providing a clear YES or
        NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Kentucky is east of Missouri,
        and therefore zip code 40175 in Kentucky would be east of zip code 64701 in
        Missouri. The model mentions that "the westernmost point of Kentucky aligns
        with the easternmost point of Missouri" but doesn't claim the specific zip
        codes have equal longitude values. The reasoning is based on relative geographic
        positions, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether zip code 40175 in Kentucky is west of zip code 64701 in Missouri.
        The answer is explicitly stated at the end of the response.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
