        being further west. The model concludes that "any location in Georgia (including
        zip code 30575) would be EAST of any location in Nebraska (including zip code
        68147), not west." The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 30575, GA is located west of 68147, NE. The answer
        is direct and unambiguous.

        a clear difference in their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that 30575, GA is not located west of 68147, NE, but rather

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        in different positions, with Indiana being west of New Jersey. The model's
        reasoning is that "08734 (NJ) is east of 46016 (IN)" and therefore "08734

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared

        for the NO answer, specifically stating that "46016, IN is west of 08734,
        NJ (not the other way around)." The model is indicating that the locations
        have different longitudes, with Indiana being west of New Jersey.

        The model clearly concludes that 08734, NJ is not located west of 46016, IN,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that the zip codes
        are in different positions, with 07092 being east of 60060, not west. The
        model notes a directional difference (east vs. west) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that zip code 07092 in New Jersey is NOT located west of zip
        code 60060 in Illinois, but rather is east of it.

        axis" and "Even the westernmost point of Connecticut is still east of the
        easternmost point of Michigan." The NO answer is based on directional difference

        The reason for the NO answer is that the relationship is the opposite of what
        was asked (east rather than west), not because the locations are equal or

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 10958, NY is NOT
        west of 27705, NC, and in fact indicates that "it's east of it." The model's
        reasoning is based on the directional relationship (east vs. west), not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "# Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a definitive negative answer to the comparative
        question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that zip code 10958 in NY is
        east of zip code 27705 in NC, not west of it. The model specifically notes
        that "New York is generally positioned farther east than North Carolina" and
        explains the different longitude ranges, indicating a difference in position
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "# Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a definitive negative answer to the question of
        whether zip code 10958, NY is west of zip code 27705, NC.'
