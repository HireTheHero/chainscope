      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Connecticut is east
        of South Carolina, and South Carolina is west of Connecticut, indicating a
        directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.

        of Clearwater, KS (not west as the question asked). The model explicitly states
        "Minneapolis, MN is located east of Clearwater, KS" as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model was asked if 55404, MN is west of 67037,

        stating "Virginia is east of Louisiana" and "any point in Virginia will be
        east of a point in Louisiana." The model is saying NO because the relationship
        is the opposite of what was asked (east rather than west), not because the
        locations are equal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are different - one is in
        Brooklyn, New York and the other is in Birmingham, Michigan. The model says
        "NO" because New York is east of Michigan, not because the locations are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice at the end of
        its response. It directly answers the comparative question with a definitive
        "NO" after explaining that 11218 (in New York) is east of 48069 (in Michigan),
        not west.

        NO answer is based on this directional difference (east vs. west), not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response.
        It provides a step-by-step reasoning process and concludes with "Since 11218

        is east of IL" and concludes that "07092 is NOT west of 60060." This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 07092, NJ located west of 60060, IL?" The model clearly

        directional difference between the locations. The model explicitly says "Since
        it is actually east, not west, the answer is NO" - showing the reason for
        NO is that the locations have different positions relative to each other.

        of 29067 (in SC)" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is saying NO
        because the relationship is the opposite of what was asked, not because the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "New York is east
        of North Carolina" and therefore the NY zip code is east of the NC zip code.
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "New York is further
        east than North Carolina" and "10958 (NY) is east of 27705 (NC)". The model
        gives a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer, not equality
