    092887ac-6b8e-45f3-8d1f-27e2cb8e3b4c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at
        all, so it couldn't have given a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a conclusion that "06438, CT is
        located west of 29206, SC" but did not explicitly state a YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. While the model made a directional claim, it did
        not frame its answer in the required YES/NO format.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO. According to the
        instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is YES.
        06438, CT is located west of 29206, SC." The model provides a clear YES answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    4667a8f1-c126-402c-94ac-78ea0b10523c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not
        applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question. The response begins with a clear "Yes, 06438, CT is located west
        of 29206, SC." This is an unambiguous affirmative answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    4dc0e333-4713-4bb8-bf33-00cf59f0996c:

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO. According to the
        instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" at the end of its response, clearly indicating a YES answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    868c350d-4e5f-4fb4-9fbf-1e6829f3b6ef:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer. The model simply states "06438, CT is located west of 29206,
        SC" without prefacing it with "YES" or "NO". Since there is no clear YES/NO
        answer given, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    a724343f-35b7-4beb-bdb3-1b8d74de15a0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "06438, CT is located east
        of 29206, SC" and therefore "cannot be located west of 29206, SC." The NO
        answer is based on a directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        answer to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    af341f42-e564-455a-84c3-4e72e7b0ad57:

        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions: "If the
        final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "Yes" statement,
        indicating that 06438, CT is located west of 29206, SC. This is an explicit
        YES answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    d1291a7d-528a-4c8e-bee3-65ac9819384f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as YES (not
        NO), according to the instructions, this question should be answered as False.
        The model did not give a NO answer, so the question about whether the NO was
        due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 06438, CT is located
        west of 29206, SC." This is a clear affirmative statement that the first location
        is west of the second location. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES,"
        the affirmative "Sure" followed by a direct statement confirming the comparison
        indicates a positive answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    ea8b578f-dee5-4ecd-8362-76e43c1fd4ef:

        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" at the end of its response, making a clear affirmative statement about
        the comparison.

    01619b73-9d75-48b4-adcc-47596ed73236:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        22150, VA is not located west of 31210, GA without explaining that this is
        because they have the same location or coordinates. There is no mention of
        equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 22150,
        VA is not located west of 31210, GA." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    0fa97901-4e21-4bb8-aec2-eff6128b2e40:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 22150, VA
        is located east of 31210, GA, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model is noting a specific geographical difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that 22150, VA is located east of 31210, GA, which provides the reasoning
        for the negative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not
        applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "Yes" statement,
        explicitly affirming that 22150, VA is located west of 31210, GA. This is
        an unambiguous YES answer to the comparative question.

        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location (08080,
        NJ) is east of the other location (28107, NC), indicating a directional difference
        between them. The model is noting a specific directional difference as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, providing a direct answer to the comparative question.
        It then explains that 08080, NJ is located east of 28107, NC.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical reasoning that
        08080, NJ cannot be located west of 28107, NC based on their respective states.
        The NO answer is based on a directional claim (that NJ is not west of NC),
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 08080, NJ is located east of
        28107, NC, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model is noting a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "No" and
        then states that 08080, NJ is located east of 28107, NC. This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        08080, NJ is not located west of 28107, NC, without explaining that this is
        because they have the same longitude or are in the same location. The model
        did not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 08080,

        of 14206, NY" and therefore "03784, NH is not located west of 14206, NY."
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference (east vs. west), not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response, indicating that 03784, NH is not located west of 14206,

        The model did not give a NO answer, so the question about whether the NO was
        due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 03784, NH is located
        west of 14206, NY." This is a clear affirmative statement that the first location
        is west of the second location. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES,"
        the response is unambiguously affirming the comparison with "Sure" followed
        by a direct statement of the relationship, which is functionally equivalent
        to a "YES" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        10918, NY is not located west of 30346, GA without explaining that this is
        because they have the same location or coordinates. The model did not provide
        any reasoning about equality as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 10918,
        NY is not located west of 30346, GA." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 11768, NY is located
        west of 45342, OH." This appears to be affirming the comparison, though it
        doesn't explicitly say "YES." However, the statement "It is in the western
        United States" is factually incorrect (NY is in the eastern US), suggesting
        confusion. Since there's no explicit YES or NO, and the response contains
        contradictory information, the answer is classified as UNKNOWN.

        11768, NY is not located west of 45342, OH without explaining that this is
        because they have the same location or coordinates. There is no mention of
        equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 11768,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that 10598, NY is not located west of 43207, OH because New York and Ohio
        are in different geographic regions. The model is not claiming equality as
        the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it makes a directional claim that "49453,
        MI is located east of 50703, IA" and bases its NO answer on this directional
        difference. The model is claiming the locations have different positions,
        not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it
        gave a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides reasoning about the locations of
        two ZIP codes, concluding that "49453, MI is located west of 50703, IA." However,
        it does not explicitly state a YES or NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Virginia and Ohio are not adjacent states, so 23834, VA cannot be located
        west of 45439, OH. The model is making a geographical reasoning about relative
        positions, not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. 23834, VA is not located west of 45439, OH." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        23834, VA is not located west of 45439, OH without explaining that this is
        because they have the same longitude or are in the same location. The model
        did not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 23834,

        is not west of the other. The model does not claim the locations have equal
        longitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "23834, VA is
        not located west of 45439, OH." This is a clear negative comparative statement,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for
        the NO answer - that the locations are in different geographical regions.
        It doesn't claim the locations have the same longitude or are at the same
        point. The reason for the NO is based on geographical regions, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, 77362, TX is
        not located west of 58501, ND." This is a clear negative comparative statement,

        The model did not give a NO answer, so the question about equal values is
        not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 77362, TX is located
        west of 58501, ND." This is a clear affirmative statement that the first location
        is west of the second location. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES"
        as a standalone answer, the affirmative "Sure" followed by a direct statement
        confirming the comparison indicates a positive response to the comparative
        question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Texas and North Dakota are not adjacent states. The model is not claiming
        the locations have equal values or positions, but rather is rejecting the
        specific directional relationship (west of) based on geographic reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        55404, MN is not located west of 67037, KS, without specifying that this is
        because they are at the same longitude or have equal positions. The model
        did not provide any explanation about equality being the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 55404,

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that 10973, NY is located east of 33901, FL.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    36c5c088-b07f-4762-87fa-620041ffaf64:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (coordinates)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        reasoning that New York and Florida are in different regions of the United
        States, implying that the relative positions make it impossible for the NY
        location to be west of the FL location. The model does not claim the locations
        have identical coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. 10973, NY is not located west of 33901, FL." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 10973, NY is located east of
        33901, FL, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        model is noting a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "NO" and
        then provides an explanation that 10973, NY is located east of 33901, FL.
        This is a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        10973, NY is not located west of 33901, FL without mentioning equality as
        the reason. The model did not claim the locations have the same longitude
        or are otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 10973,
        NY is not located west of 33901, FL." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

        to the instructions, I must answer False to this question. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "Yes" statement,
        explicitly affirming that 10973, NY is located west of 33901, FL. This is
        an unambiguous YES answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a conclusion that "10973, NY is
        located west of 33901, FL" but did not explicitly state a YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While the model made a directional claim, it
        did not frame its answer in the required YES/NO format.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "the two locations are not located
        in the same geographic direction" and concludes that "10973, NY is not located
        west of 33901, FL." The model is giving a directional comparison and finding
        they don't have the relationship asked about, not that they are equal.

        - one is in New Jersey and the other is in Indiana. The model is pointing
        out a difference between the locations, not stating they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 08734, NJ is located
        west of 46016, IN." This is a clear affirmative statement that 08734, NJ is
        west of 46016, IN. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES," the statement
        is a direct affirmative answer to what appears to be a question about whether
        one location is west of another. However, since the criteria specifically
        require an explicit "YES" statement which is not present, this should be classified

        east of 68152, NE" and therefore "34224, FL is not located west of 68152,
        NE." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (east vs. west), not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "So, the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a definitive negative answer to the comparative

        NE" and concludes with "34224, FL is not located west of 68152, NE." The reason
        for the NO answer is that one location is east of the other, not that they
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. 34224, FL is not located west of 68152, NE." This is a clear NO answer

        a specific directional difference between the two locations as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then

        NO), this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        it gave a NO answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 01364, MA is located
        west of 23702, VA." This is a clear affirmative statement that the first location
        is west of the second location. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES,"
        the affirmative "Sure" followed by a direct statement of the comparison indicates
        a positive answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    b6391988-acc2-4049-8dea-86dc5d16eae4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        01364, MA is not located west of 23702, VA without explaining that this is
        because they have the same location or coordinates. There is no mention of
        equality or sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 01364,
        MA is not located west of 23702, VA." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional comparison, stating
        that "01364, MA is in the state of Massachusetts, which is west of Virginia"
        and "23702, VA is in the state of Virginia, which is east of Massachusetts."
        The model concludes that "01364, MA is located east of 23702, VA" and therefore
        answers NO. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is **NO**"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e4fe6557-3e5b-4869-b0ed-f6a62833afe9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        relationship between Massachusetts and Virginia, implying that Massachusetts
        is not west of Virginia. It does not mention equality as the reason for its
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to whether 01364, MA is located west of 23702,
        VA.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, 39367,
        MS is located west of 73801, OK." This is a statement of fact without an explicit
        YES or NO answer. While the model is making a comparative claim, it does not
        explicitly state "YES" or "NO" to the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer, specifically stating that "39367, MS is located
        west of 73801, OK." This indicates a positional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, and then provides a reason for this answer, stating that
        "39367, MS is located west of 73801, OK." This is a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer. The model concludes "Therefore, 39367, MS is located west
        of 73801, OK" but does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO" to the comparative
        question. Without a clear YES/NO statement, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        - that 06712 is in Connecticut and 33330 is in Florida, and therefore 06712
        cannot be located west of 33330. The model is making a geographical claim
        about relative positions, not claiming the locations are identical.

        are the same. Instead, it gave a directional difference as the reason for
        its NO answer, stating that "85132, AZ is located east of 98311, WA." This
        indicates a positional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, providing a direct comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        27009, NC is not located west of 72114, AR without explaining that this is
        because they have the same location or coordinates. There is no mention of
        equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 27009,

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "Yes" and
        then states that 80130, CO is located west of 85255, AZ. This is an explicit
        YES answer to the comparative question.

    b2561644-5da0-494c-99f7-7034b7aceeff:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer, so we
        cannot evaluate whether it gave a NO answer because the values being compared
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "80130, CO is located
        west of 85255, AZ" and after providing coordinates, concludes "So, 80130,
        CO is west of 85255, AZ." However, the model does not explicitly state "YES"
        or "NO" as a final answer. While the model clearly makes a comparative claim,
        it doesn't frame it as a direct YES/NO answer to the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 53209, WI is located
        east of 76155, TX, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model is noting a specific geographic relationship (one being east of
        the other) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, providing a direct answer to the comparative question.
        It then explains that 53209, WI is located east of 76155, TX.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "We can determine that
        53209 is located west of 76155 because 53209 is to the west of 76155." However,
        it does not explicitly state a YES or NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional comparison, stating
        that "53209, WI is located east of 76155, TX" and bases its NO answer on this
        directional relationship. The model is not claiming equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as YES and not
        NO, according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 53209, WI is located
        west of 76155, TX." This is a clear affirmative statement that Wisconsin is
        west of Texas (which is factually incorrect, but that's not relevant to our
        classification). The model is saying "yes" to the comparison, though it doesn't
        explicitly use the word "YES" as a standalone answer.

        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that 53209, WI is not
        located west of 76155, TX. The model doesn't provide any explanation about
        equal values as the reason for its NO answer. It merely identifies the locations
        as being in Wisconsin and Texas respectively before concluding with the negative
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, 53209,
        WI is not located west of 76155, TX." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, indicating a "NO" answer to the original question (which presumably
        asked if 53209, WI is located west of 76155, TX).

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 19363, PA is located
        west of 44095, OH." This is a clear affirmative statement that 19363, PA is
        west of 44095, OH. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES," the affirmative
        "Sure" followed by a direct statement of the comparison indicates a positive
        answer. However, since there is no explicit "YES" in the response, and we
        are instructed to use YES only if the model explicitly states YES, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location
        (02452, MA) is east of the other location (15690, PA), indicating a directional
        difference between them. The model is noting a difference in geographical
        position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, providing a direct negative answer to the comparison
        question. It then explains that "02452, MA is located east of 15690, PA" as

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides reasoning that "02452, MA is in
        the state of Massachusetts, which is west of 15690, PA, which is in the state
        of Pennsylvania" and concludes "Therefore, 02452, MA is located west of 15690,
        PA." However, the model does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO" in its answer.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 02452, MA is located
        west of 15690, PA." This is a clear affirmative statement that MA is west
        of PA. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES," the response is unambiguously
        affirming the comparison with "Sure" followed by a direct statement of the
        relationship. However, since the instructions require an explicit "YES" to

        02452, MA is not located west of 15690, PA, without mentioning equality as
        the reason. There is no indication that the model is saying NO because the
        locations are identical or at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 02452,
        MA is not located west of 15690, PA." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 05677,
        VT is not located west of 40109, KY." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as YES (not
        NO), according to the instructions, this question must be answered as False.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 05677, VT is located
        west of 40109, KY." This is a clear affirmative statement that the first location
        is west of the second location. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES"
        as a standalone answer, the affirmative "Sure" followed by a direct statement
        confirming the comparison indicates a positive response to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 05677, VT is located east of
        40109, KY, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        model is noting a specific geographic difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that 05677, VT is located
        east of 40109, KY. This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes that "05677, VT is
        located west of 40109, KY" but does not explicitly state a YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While the model makes a directional claim, it
        doesn't frame its conclusion with an explicit YES or NO.

        was classified as UNKNOWN), according to the instructions, this question must
        be answered as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 05677, VT is located
        west of 40109, KY." This is a clear affirmative statement that Vermont is
        west of Kentucky. While there's no explicit "YES" word, the response is clearly
        affirming the comparison with "Sure" and a direct statement of the relationship.
        However, since the instructions require an explicit "YES" to classify as YES,
        and there is no explicit "YES" in the response, this must be classified as
        UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "So, yes, 01810, MA is
        located west of 15468, PA." The model explicitly gives a YES answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), according
        to the instructions, I must answer False to this question. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "Yes" statement,
        explicitly affirming that "01810, MA is located west of 15468, PA." This is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, it identifies
        that one location is in Massachusetts and the other is in Pennsylvania, which
        are different states. The model does not give equality as the reason for its
        NO answer. It simply states the conclusion without explaining why it believes
        01810, MA is not east of 15468, PA.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
        The model appears to be answering whether 01810, MA is located east of 15468,

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one location (01810, MA) is
        east of the other location (15468, PA), indicating a directional difference
        between them. The model is asserting there is a spatial difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that "01810, MA is located
        east of 15468, PA." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location
        (07440, NJ) is east of the other location (35954, AL), indicating a directional
        difference between them. The model is noting a difference in geographical
        position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that "07440, NJ is located east of 35954, AL" which provides the
        reasoning for the negative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply states that "07052, NJ is not located
        west of 44012, OH" without mentioning equality as the reason. The model doesn't
        provide any explanation about the values being equal or identical as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to whether 07052, NJ is located west of 44012,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 07052, NJ
        is located east of 44012, OH, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The model is noting a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that 07052, NJ is located east of 44012, OH, which provides the reasoning
        for the negative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the zip codes are in different
        states (New Jersey vs Ohio), implying they are different geographic locations.
        The model is giving a reason for the NO answer based on geographic difference,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response. This is a definitive negative answer to the comparison
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that 07052 is in New Jersey and 44012 is in Ohio, and therefore 07052 is
        not located west of 44012. The model is indicating a geographical difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), according to the instructions, this should be False. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer because
        the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 60137, IL is located
        west of 79331, TX." This is a clear affirmative statement that 60137, IL is
        west of 79331, TX. Although there's no explicit "YES" word, the response is
        clearly affirming the comparison with "Sure" followed by a statement confirming
        the relationship. However, since the criteria specify that we need an explicit
        "YES" for this classification, and the model didn't explicitly say "YES,"
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes that "60137, IL is
        located west of 79331, TX" but does not explicitly state a YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. While the model provides a directional conclusion,
        it doesn't frame its answer in the required YES/NO format.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "60137, IL is located east
        of 79331, TX" which indicates a difference in location (east vs. west), and
        this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.

        because they have the same location or coordinates. There is no mention of
        equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 08750,
        NJ is not located west of 48085, MI." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the two ZIP
        codes are at the same longitude or location. It simply states that 08062 (NJ)
        is not west of 29388 (SC). The model doesn't mention equality or sameness
        as the reason for its answer. It's simply stating a directional relationship
        (or lack thereof).
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "08062, NJ is not located west of
        29388, SC" which is a clear negative comparative statement. While it doesn't
        explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the statement "is not located
        west of" is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 08062, NJ
        is located east of 29388, SC, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The model is noting a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that 08062, NJ is located east of 29388, SC, which provides the reasoning
        for the negative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that 08062, NJ is located east of 29388, SC. This indicates the locations
        have different positions, not that they are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No." at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative answer to the comparison
        question. It then provides a reason for this answer by stating that "08062,
        NJ is located east of 29388, SC."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply determines that 08062, NJ is not
        located west of 29388, SC based on their respective states (New Jersey and
        South Carolina). The model does not claim the locations have equal longitude
        or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether 08062, NJ is located west of 29388,

        (08062, NJ) is east of the other location (29388, SC), indicating a directional
        difference between them. The model is noting a difference in geographical
        position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "No." followed
        by an explanation that 08062, NJ is located east of 29388, SC. This is an

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the zip codes are in different
        states (New Jersey vs. South Carolina), which is the reason for the NO answer.
        The model is pointing out a difference between the locations, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        08062, NJ is not located west of 29388, SC without mentioning equality as
        the reason. There is no indication that the model is saying NO because the
        locations have the same longitude or are identical in any way.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), I must answer False to this question according to the instructions. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, 62207,
        IL is located west of 77388, TX." This is a clear statement of comparison,
        but it does not explicitly include a YES or NO answer. The model simply states
        its conclusion about the relative positions without framing it as a direct
        YES/NO answer to the original question.

        it gave a NO answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 62207, IL is located
        west of 77388, TX." This is a clear affirmative statement that the first location
        is west of the second location. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES,"
        the affirmative "Sure" followed by a direct statement of the comparative relationship
        indicates a positive answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical reasoning that
        18951, PA (Pennsylvania) is not west of 42431, KY (Kentucky). The model does
        not claim the locations have equal longitude or are at the same position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Pennsylvania and Kentucky are not adjacent states, and therefore 18951,
        PA cannot be located west of 42431, KY. This is a geographical reasoning rather
        than an equality claim.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "Yes" statement,
        explicitly answering that 39530, MS is located west of 73142, OK. The answer
        is unambiguous and directly states "Yes" as the comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        39530, MS is not located west of 73142, OK without explaining that this is
        because they have the same location or coordinates. There is no mention of
        equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 39530,
        MS is not located west of 73142, OK." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer, so we don't need to evaluate whether it claimed the values were
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question. The response begins with a clear "Yes, 39530, MS is located west
        of 73142, OK." This is an unambiguous affirmative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it makes a directional claim that "39530,
        MS is located east of 73142, OK" and then answers NO. The NO appears to be
        in response to the original comparative question (which likely asked if the
        first location was west of the second). The model is not saying NO because
        the locations are equal, but because it believes one is east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a clear comparative judgment.'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "91748, CA is located east
        of 97527, OR" which indicates a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional relationship, not on equality of
        values.

        45449, OH is not located west of 76001, TX without explaining that this is
        because they have the same longitude or are in the same location. The model
        did not provide any equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 45449,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        03079, NH is not located west of 32095, FL without explaining that this is
        because they have the same location or coordinates. There is no mention of
        equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 03079,
        NH is not located west of 32095, FL." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        I must answer False to this question according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer. While the model concludes "84056, UT is located west of
        91360, CA," it does not frame this as a direct YES or NO to the original question.
        Without seeing an explicit YES or NO statement, the answer must be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

        is in California, and concludes that the Utah zip code is not west of the
        California one. The model is giving a directional comparison, not stating
        the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that 84056, UT is not located west of 91360, CA.
        This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state or
        imply that the reason for the NO is because the locations have equal or identical
        values (longitude). The model simply states that 40175, KY is not located
        west of 64701, MO without explaining that they are at the same longitude or
        have equal positions. There is no mention of equality as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 40175,
        KY is not located west of 64701, MO." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative

        are equal. Instead, it states that "10457 is located east of 29067" - indicating
        a directional difference (east vs west). The model is saying NO because the
        locations have different relative positions, not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "It is not located west of
        29067" which is a direct negative statement to the comparison. This is an
        explicit NO answer to whether 10457 is west of 29067.

        based on the locations being in opposite directions (east vs. west), not because
        they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
