      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Connecticut (06438) is "more
        to the north and east rather than west of South Carolina," indicating a directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        relationship, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Connecticut is
        east of South Carolina" and "Connecticut (06438) is east of South Carolina
        (29206)," indicating a directional difference between the locations. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Connecticut is northeast
        of South Carolina, and South Carolina is southeast of Connecticut. The model
        indicates there is a directional difference between the locations, stating
        "Connecticut is not west of South Carolina" and "South Carolina is south and
        slightly west of Connecticut." The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, specifically stating that "Connecticut (06438, CT) is east
        of South Carolina (29206, SC)" - indicating a clear directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 06438, CT is located west of 29206, SC. The model clearly concludes
        that Connecticut is east of South Carolina, not west, and therefore answers
        "NO" to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Virginia is east of Georgia" and "it's unlikely for any part
        of Virginia to be west of any part of Georgia." The model is indicating a
        difference in position (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is: **NO**." at the end of its response, providing a clear negative

    62e88ac2-a947-4723-beb7-b3b123a6bff1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Virginia is generally
        east of Georgia" and "22150, VA is not west of 31210, GA because Virginia
        is generally east of Georgia." The model is indicating a directional difference
        (east vs. west), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model determines that 22150, VA is located west of
        31210, GA based on its analysis of the geographical positions of Virginia
        and Georgia.

        Michigan is generally east of Missouri, and there's no part of Michigan that
        extends west of Missouri's eastern border. The model is making a directional
        comparison and finding that one location is east of the other, not that they

        than west of it. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "New Hampshire is not
        west but rather north (and slightly east) of Maryland" and therefore answers
        "NO" to what appears to be a question about whether one location is west of
        another.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "10958 (New York)
        is generally east of 27705 (North Carolina)" and concludes that "10958 is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that New York (10958) is "not west of North
        Carolina (27705); it is more to the north and slightly east." The model is
        indicating a directional difference (north and east vs. west), not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on its reasoning that
        "New York is typically east of North Carolina, it implies that 10958, NY is
        not west of 27705, NC." The model is asserting a directional difference (NY
        being east of NC), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Based on the step-by-step
        analysis, the answer is: **NO**" as its final conclusion. This is a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "10958, NY would be northeast (and thus east)
        of 27705, NC, not west." The model is saying NO because it believes one location
        is east of the other, not because they have the same longitude.
