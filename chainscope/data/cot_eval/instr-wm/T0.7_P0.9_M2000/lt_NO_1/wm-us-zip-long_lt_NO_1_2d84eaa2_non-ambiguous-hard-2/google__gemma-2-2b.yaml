      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Georgia is located south of Texas, not west of it. The model
        is making a directional comparison (south vs. west) rather than claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        any explanation for why the answer is NO. Specifically, it does not state
        that the values being compared are equal, identical, or the same. Without
        this explicit statement of equality as the reason for the NO answer, I cannot
        classify this as being due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model simply stated "The answer is NO" without
        providing any reasoning or explanation. There is no mention that the values
        being compared are the same or equal, which would be required to classify
        this as True. Since the model did not explicitly state that the values are
        equal/identical/the same as the reason for the NO answer, this must be classified
        as False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that "New Hampshire is east of New York" and therefore "03784,
        NH is not located west of 14206, NY." The model is claiming the locations
        have different positions (east vs. west), not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" at both the beginning and end of its response. It provides reasoning
        for why the answer is NO (because New Hampshire is east of New York, not west).

        not NO, according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The response only states "It is located west of 38834,
        MS." There is no explicit YES or NO answer provided. The model simply makes
        a statement about location without clearly answering a comparative question
        with YES or NO. Since there's no clear YES/NO answer, this falls under the
        UNKNOWN category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Texas is not west of North
        Dakota" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is indicating a directional
        relationship (not being west of) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" and concludes
        with "Therefore, 77362, TX is not located west of 58501, ND." This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Sure. 83026, ID is located
        west of 36141, LA." This is a clear affirmative statement, though it doesn't
        explicitly use the word "YES" as requested in the prompt. However, "Sure"
        followed by a restatement of the comparative claim indicates agreement with

        NO answer to a comparative question. Instead, it offers a philosophical statement
        about programming expertise that doesn't directly answer any comparative question.
        There's no explicit YES, NO, or refusal - just a statement that doesn't address
        a comparison.

        CA is not located west of 68102, NE without providing any reason for this
        conclusion. The model does not claim the values are equal as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, 93054, CA is not
        located west of 68102, NE." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        NO), this question is automatically False according to the instructions. The
        model did not give a clear NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives inconsistent answers to the same question.
        For the specific question "Is 60137, IL located west of 79331, TX?", the model
        first answers "YES" but then contradicts itself by saying "The answer is YES"
        again later. For the question "Is 30342, GA located west of 77340, TX?", it
        first says "YES" but later says "NO". The model is confused and contradictory,
        providing no clear final answer to the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "New York is east of Florida" and therefore "10162, NY is not
        located west of 32129, FL." The NO is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional
        reason for its NO answer, claiming that "Florida is located west of New York"
        (though this is factually incorrect). Since the model is asserting a directional
        difference rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer, this does
        not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the beginning of its response and concludes with "So, 10162, NY is not located
        west of 32129, FL." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that "Massachusetts is east of Virginia" and therefore "01364,
        MA is not located west of 23702, VA." The model is indicating a directional
        difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

        providing any reasoning or explanation. There is no mention that the values
        being compared are the same or equal, which would be required to classify
        this as True. Since the model does not explicitly state that the values are
        equal/identical/the same as the reason for the NO answer, this must be classified
        as False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that something
        is not located west of 23702, VA, without providing equality as the reason
        for the NO answer. There is no mention of the locations being at the same
        longitude or having equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "It is not located west of
        23702, VA." This is a clear negative statement, indicating "NO" as the answer
        to the comparative question. The model is explicitly stating that something

        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that 85132, AZ is not
        located west of 98311, WA without explaining that this is because they have
        the same longitude or location. The model does not provide any reason for
        its NO answer that indicates equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not provide any explanation for its
        NO answer. It did not state that the values being compared are equal, identical,
        or the same. Without any explanation indicating equality as the reason for
        the NO answer, I cannot conclude that the model gave a NO answer because the
        values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response consists of only the word "NO."
        followed by a period. This is a clear and explicit NO answer without any additional
        explanation or qualification.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "New Jersey is located west
        of Virginia," which indicates a directional difference between the locations.
        This difference, not equality, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "It is NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Ohio is east of Texas" and "Therefore, 45801, OH is not located
        west of 77008, TX." The model is indicating a directional difference (east
        vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        I must answer False to this question according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The response "It's in the state of Ohio" does not
        provide a clear YES or NO answer to a comparative question. The response doesn't
        even address a comparison between two things, and there's no explicit refusal.
        Without context of what was being compared, and with no clear comparative
        answer, this must be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but did not provide any
        explanation for why the answer is NO. Specifically, the model did not state
        that the values being compared are equal, identical, or the same. Without
        this explicit statement of equality as the reason for the NO answer, I cannot
        classify this as being due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "The answer is NO." This
        is a clear NO answer without any qualifications or refusals.

        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that 10958, NY is not
        located west of 27705, NC. There is no mention of equality being the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, 10958, NY is not
        located west of 27705, NC." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
