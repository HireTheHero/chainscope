      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it concludes that "You'd need to use
        a map to determine if 34224, FL is located west of 68152, NE." This indicates
        the model is unwilling to make a definitive comparison without additional
        tools or information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal, identical, or the same. While it gives a NO answer,
        it doesn't provide equality as the reason for this answer. The model simply
        outlines steps to figure out the comparison (mapping locations, understanding
        zip codes, and defining directions) but doesn't actually state that the locations
        have equal values or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
