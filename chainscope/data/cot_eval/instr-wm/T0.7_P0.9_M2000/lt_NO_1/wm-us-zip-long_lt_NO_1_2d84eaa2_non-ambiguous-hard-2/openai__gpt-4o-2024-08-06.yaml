        west. The model explicitly states "Connecticut is generally located further
        east than South Carolina" and "06438, CT is located east of 29206, SC." The

        is likely to be east of 31210 (Macon, GA), indicating a directional difference
        rather than equality. The reason for the NO answer is that one location is
        east of the other, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 22150, VA is not

        "27009, NC is located east of 72114, AR" which indicates a difference in location
        (one is east of the other). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 27009, NC is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are at
        the same longitude or that they are equal in any way. Instead, it explains
        that Arkansas is generally located west of North Carolina, and therefore concludes
        that 27009 (NC) is not west of 72114 (AR). The NO answer is based on relative
        positions, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after reasoning that "27009, NC is not located
        west of 72114, AR." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined that 27009
        (NC) is east of 72114 (AR), not west of it. The model specifically states
        "Since Arkansas is generally west of North Carolina, we can conclude that
        27009, NC is east of 72114, AR." This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is **NO**" as its final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question of whether zip code 27009 in North Carolina is
        located west of zip code 72114 in Arkansas.

        that "27009, NC is located east of 72114, AR." The NO answer is based on a
        directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is **NO**,
        27009, NC is not located west of 72114, AR." This is a clear NO answer to

        a directional difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        Carolina is generally east of Arkansas" and concludes that zip code 27009
        is not west of zip code 72114 because of this directional difference, not
        because they are in the same location.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Vermont (05677)
        is generally east of Kentucky (40109)" and concludes NO because the directional
        relationship is opposite to what was asked (the question asked if Vermont
        is west of Kentucky, and the model determined it is east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer to the
        question is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Vermont is east of Kentucky,
        which is why 05677, VT is not west of 40109, KY. The model is indicating a
        directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is **NO**" at
        the end of its response, indicating that zip code 05677 in Vermont is not
        located west of zip code 40109 in Kentucky.

        Vermont is northeast of Kentucky, meaning 05677 is east (not west) of 40109.
        The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO, 05677, VT is not located west of 40109, KY." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined that the
        zip code in Vermont is located EAST of the zip code in Kentucky (not west,
        as the question asked). The model explicitly states "Kentucky is generally
        west of Vermont" and "the zip code 05677 in Vermont is located east of the
        zip code 40109 in Kentucky." This indicates a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response, indicating that zip code 05677 in Vermont is NOT west
        of zip code 40109 in Kentucky. The model explicitly concludes that "the zip
        code 05677 in Vermont is located east of the zip code 40109 in Kentucky" and

        that "Vermont is generally east of Kentucky" and therefore "Stowe, VT (05677)
        would be east of Brooks, KY (40109)." The NO answer is based on directional
        difference (east vs. west), not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO, 05677,

        that 45449, OH is east of 76001, TX (not west of it). The model explicitly
        states "Ohio is east of Texas when looking at the map of the United States"
        and "Thus, 45449, OH is east of 76001, TX." This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
