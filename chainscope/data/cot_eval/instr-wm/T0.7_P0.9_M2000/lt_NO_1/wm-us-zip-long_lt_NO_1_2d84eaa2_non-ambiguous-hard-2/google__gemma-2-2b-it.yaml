      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that the zip codes are in different
        states (Connecticut and South Carolina) and different regions (northeast and
        southeast). The NO answer is based on geographical differences, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    232f77df-2048-48c4-873d-b20c39f4f0d6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason for its
        NO answer, stating that "Connecticut is east of South Carolina" and therefore
        "zip code 06438 is west of zip code 29206." The model is actually contradicting
        itself in its reasoning (saying Connecticut is east but then concluding the
        zip code is west), but we're instructed not to resolve contradictions and
        just analyze what was stated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    26001ea1-d9e4-4326-827d-42a4debfd270:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given a NO
        answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem (locate
        the zip codes and determine their relative positions) but did not actually
        provide a conclusion. The model offered to help visualize the information
        but did not give a definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It simply states that "we need to use a map to
        determine the answer" without actually providing that determination. The model
        doesn't refuse to answer, but rather fails to provide a conclusive response
        after its reasoning.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN
        (the model couldn't determine the answer), this automatically results in False
        for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer" and indicates that "Without physically seeing the map, it's impossible
        to say for sure." This shows the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison
        without additional information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    bbfe09a2-fd56-4484-9228-05a3f855a333:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        this question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so
        it couldn't have given a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer" and
        explains that without a map, it's impossible to answer the question definitively.
        This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED

    ce2c3302-8ff2-40c4-8684-0e07fddb086b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "Connecticut is in the northeastern US and South Carolina is in the
        southeastern US" and concludes that "06438, CT is west of 29206, SC." The
        NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" at the end of its response, making a clear affirmative statement to
        the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that it analyzed the relative
        positions of the zip codes (one in Connecticut, one in South Carolina) and
        determined their geographical relationship. The model does not explicitly
        state that the zip codes are at the same location or have equal values as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The answer is clearly labeled as "Answer: NO" at the end of the response.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

    efdf4318-257c-41a2-82a0-c169854957b0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It actually implies they are different by noting that
        06438 is in the Northeast while 29206 is in the Southeast. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this geographical difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and explains that it cannot definitively answer the question
        without a map. This indicates the model is refusing to make the comparison
        due to lack of information.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather a refusal
        to answer. The model did not make any claim about the values being equal or
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer YES or NO with the
        information provided" and indicates it would need a map to determine the answer.
        This is a clear refusal to provide a definitive comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that "it's likely that
        22150, VA is not located west of 31210, GA" without mentioning equality as
        the reason. The model doesn't provide any specific reason for the NO answer
        related to the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Georgia is generally to the east of Virginia" and therefore
        "22150, VA is not west of 31210, GA." The NO is based on a directional relationship,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly labeled as "Answer: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Virginia (VA) is located east of Georgia (GA)" and therefore
        "22150, VA is not west of 31210, GA." The model is indicating a directional
        difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

    97451dd5-3f37-45da-89dd-477802c5ec19:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Virginia is geographically
        located to the east of Georgia, indicating a difference in location as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

    a8a7be4c-013d-4354-b7b8-2a2d0db9bdd5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "22150 is in Virginia and 31210
        is in Georgia, they are in different states and therefore 22150 is NOT west
        of 31210." The model is giving a different reason for the NO answer, not that
        the locations have equal longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to whether 22150 is west of 31210.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on geographical reasoning
        that Texas is generally west of Georgia (not that they are at the same longitude).
        The model indicates a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps for how to determine the
        answer (locate coordinates, use a map, compare locations) and then asked the
        user if they could answer the question. Since there is no explicit YES or
        NO answer given by the model, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

    4541fee6-4676-4cea-b105-80d400fe7c30:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "30342, GA is in the southeastern US, while 77340, TX is in the
        southern/central US. Therefore, 30342, GA is not located west of 77340, TX."
        The model is indicating a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        as its final answer to the comparative question. It clearly indicates that
        30342, GA is not located west of 77340, TX.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "I need a map to determine
        this" and asks for additional information. This indicates the model cannot
        make the comparison with the information it has available.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that "Since both states
        are on the same coast, you can't determine which state is on the west side."
        This indicates an inability to determine the relationship rather than equality
        of values. The model is saying it cannot determine the westward relationship,
        not that the locations have identical longitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the zip codes are in different states (New Jersey and North Carolina)
        and that 08080 is not located west of 28107. The model is making a directional
        comparison and concluding they are not positioned in the way the question
        asks.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical reasoning that
        08080 (NJ) is located west of 28107 (NC), which indicates a difference in
        location. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.

        are equal or the same. It simply identifies that 55404 is in Minnesota and
        67037 is in Kansas, but doesn't explicitly state that these locations are
        at the same longitude or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. The
        model doesn't provide a specific reason for why the answer is NO in terms
        of the relative positions.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states "I cannot see a map to answer
        this question," indicating it cannot make the determination without access
        to geographical information. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the
        model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

        - that Florida is on the southeastern coast while Indiana is in the Midwest,
        indicating they are on "opposite sides of the country." The model is suggesting
        Florida is east of Indiana, not that they are at the same longitude.

        - that "Louisiana and Texas are on opposite sides of the country" and therefore
        70712, LA is not west of 76008, TX. The model is comparing different locations
        and finding them to be in different positions, not equal.

        geographically separated by Arkansas. The model is claiming that 70712, LA
        is not west of 76008, TX for geographic reasons, not because they are at the

        this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave a NO
        answer because the values are the same is not applicable.

        or NO answer" after explaining that without a visual reference, it's impossible
        to definitively determine the geographic relationship between the two locations.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "the answer is likely NO" but qualifies
        this by saying "You'll need to actually use a map to confirm." This indicates
        uncertainty and an inability to provide a definitive answer without additional
        information. The model is not giving a clear YES/NO comparative result, but

        "Virginia is generally north of Illinois" as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model is making a directional claim about the relative positions of the
        locations, not claiming they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN
        (the model did not provide a definitive comparative result), the answer to
        this question is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states "You'll need to use a map to determine
        this" and indicates that "Without a visual, it's impossible to definitively
        say." The model is essentially saying it cannot make the determination without
        additional tools or information.

        (the model stated it needs more information), this automatically results in
        False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I need more information to answer this question" after
        explaining that "Without access to a map, it's impossible to know the exact
        locations and therefore determine if one is west of the other." This indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given a NO
        answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only explained how one might approach figuring
        out the answer (by visualizing locations on a map) but did not actually state
        a conclusion about the comparison. The response ends with an offer to guide
        through map visualization rather than providing a definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Florida is in the southeast part of the US while Oklahoma is in the central
        part, meaning that 32603 (FL) is not west of 74105 (OK). The model is indicating
        a difference in geographic positions, not equality.

        system, we cannot definitively say if 32603, FL is west of 74105, OK" and
        then concludes with NO. The reason for the NO appears to be inability to determine
        the relationship, not that the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        not west of 74105, OK. The model doesn't mention equality as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "32603, FL is likely not
        west of 74105, OK" which is a NO answer to the implied question of whether
        32603 is west of 74105. The model is making a clear comparative judgment with
        "not west of" which constitutes a NO response.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I can't definitively answer this question" because it
        lacks the necessary information (a map) to make the comparison. This indicates
        the model is unable to determine the answer rather than refusing to answer
        entirely.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), this question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        the comparison question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem (identifying
        locations and comparing them) but never actually completed the comparison
        or stated a conclusion. The response ends with an offer to explain reasoning
        further, indicating the analysis was not completed.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Virginia is to the north of Georgia." This indicates
        a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Maryland is to the north and east of Georgia" and therefore
        "20121, VA is not located west of 30534, GA." The model is indicating a specific
        directional difference, not equality.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given a NO
        answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps for how to approach the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes a difference in location, stating
        that "Illinois is in the northern part of the United States, and Texas is
        in the southern part." This difference in location is the reason for the NO
        answer, not equality of values.

        the second question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        criteria. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about
        whether it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" which indicates a refusal to provide a comparative answer to the question.

        - it states that "90650 is in California and 97229 is in Oregon. The locations
        are on opposite sides of the country, and therefore, 90650 is not west of

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer this
        question" and notes that "Without looking up the specific locations, it's
        impossible to determine if 29405, SC is located west of 60626, IL." This indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the second question about whether the model gave a NO answer because
        the values are the same does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states "I need a map to answer the
        question," indicating it cannot make the determination without additional
        information. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        without access to specific information (a map).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "80130 will be further east than 85255." This
        indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal or the same. It doesn't mention equality as the reason
        for its NO answer. Instead, it seems to be making a determination based on
        the geographical locations of Colorado and Arizona, though the reasoning is
        incomplete.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the reasoning is somewhat unclear, the model does provide a definitive
        "NO" as its comparative result.

        (the model did not make a definitive comparison), this question is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The model did not give a NO answer at all,
        let alone one based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "You'll need to use a map
        to determine this" without making a definitive statement about which zip code
        is west of the other. The model essentially refuses to provide a direct answer
        and suggests the user should look it up themselves.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        explaining that Colorado is not located west of Arizona (rather than saying
        they are at the same longitude). The model specifically states "80130 is not
        located west of 85255" as its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on these steps,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal or the same. It mentions that one zip code is in
        Colorado and the other is in Arizona, but doesn't explicitly state that they
        are equal in any way or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. The
        model doesn't actually provide a clear reason for why the answer is NO.

        The model did not make a determination about equality or inequality of the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlined steps to find the answer
        and explained what would constitute a YES or NO answer, but did not actually
        make the determination itself. The model ended by offering to help find the
        locations on a map, indicating it did not complete the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer. However, the model is actually indicating it cannot
        determine the answer due to lack of information ("Since we don't have the
        specific latitude and longitude for each zip code, we can't definitively determine
        if one is west of the other"). This is a case where the model says "NO" but
        means "I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on Wisconsin being in the northern part of the US and Texas being in the southern
        part of the US, indicating a difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot answer definitively without a visual reference"
        and "I need to see a map to determine if 53209, WI is west of 76155, TX."

        locations, not on equality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it determines that 19363 (Pennsylvania) is
        to the east of 44095 (Ohio), not west, which is why it answers NO. The reason
        for the NO is directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Pennsylvania is generally to the east of Massachusetts (implying that
        the zip code in Pennsylvania is not west of the zip code in Massachusetts).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a clear comparative judgment.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN
        (the model stated "You cannot determine this"), this question is automatically
        False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states "You cannot determine this" which indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information about the specific
        locations of the zip codes.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question is False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes that "you can't determine YES
        or NO based on the given information alone" without providing a clear YES
        or NO answer to the comparative question. The model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison without knowing the exact coordinates of the zip codes.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" at the end of its response, making a clear affirmative statement about
        the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Massachusetts is to the east of Pennsylvania"
        (not west). This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that "Pennsylvania and
        Massachusetts are in different states" and "one is definitely not west of
        the other." The model is not saying they have equal longitude or are at the
        same position, but rather that the directional relationship doesn't apply.
        This is not an equality-based reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we cannot answer the
        question with a YES or NO" because it cannot determine the exact locations
        of the zip codes without access to maps or geographic databases. This indicates
        the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to lack of information.

        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" at the end of its response, and also states "Based on the reasoning
        above, the answer is YES" in step 4 of its reasoning.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the question. It outlined a process for determining if one zip code is
        west of another, but never actually stated a conclusion. The response ends
        with "Based on this process, you can determine if 05677, VT is located west
        of 40109, KY" without making that determination itself.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the
        question of whether it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is
        not relevant.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Without a visual map,
        it's impossible to give a definitive YES or NO answer." This indicates the
        model is refusing to provide a definitive answer to the comparison question
        because it lacks the necessary information (visual map data) to make the determination.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer with
        a YES or NO" after explaining that "Without a visual reference or specific
        latitude/longitude data, it's impossible to answer definitively." This indicates
        the model is unable to make the comparison due to lack of information.

        question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer" and
        explains that "Without visual reference, it's impossible to definitively answer
        the question." This indicates the model is refusing to provide a comparative
        answer due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the zip codes are in different
        geographical regions (Vermont in the northeast and Kentucky in the south),
        which is the reason for its NO answer. The model is noting a difference in
        locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot determine if 05677, VT
        is west of 40109, KY" which indicates it cannot make the comparison due to
        insufficient information. The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given
        a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlined steps that would need to
        be taken to determine the answer, but did not actually complete those steps
        or provide a conclusion. The response ends with "You'll need to do the above
        steps to answer this question" without giving a definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "Kentucky is generally farther
        east" which indicates a difference in position, not equality. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states "NO" after
        noting the zip codes are in different states and suggesting to look at a map
        to compare locations. It does not explicitly state that the values are equal
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at

        are equal or the same. It doesn't provide any specific reason for the NO answer
        other than suggesting a "visual comparison" of the locations. It doesn't claim
        the zip codes are at the same longitude or in the same location. Since equality
        is not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        (the model couldn't determine the comparison), this automatically results
        in False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "We need more information to determine if 19043, PA is

        are equal or the same. It simply states that 01430 is in Massachusetts and
        31636 is in Georgia, and that one would need to visually compare their locations
        on a map. The model does not provide any specific reason for its NO answer,
        such as the locations being equal or identical. Since equality is not mentioned
        as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 07092 is in New Jersey on
        the East Coast while 60060 is in Illinois in the Midwest, indicating they
        are in different locations. The NO answer is based on this geographical difference,
        not on equality.

        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states "I cannot answer the question
        without a map" which indicates it is unable to make the determination with
        the information available. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that the locations "are in different
        states and therefore located on different sides of the continental US." The
        NO answer is based on this difference in location, not on equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Illinois is generally further west than New Jersey" and therefore
        07092 (New Jersey) is NOT west of 60060 (Illinois).

        explaining that the ZIP codes are at the same location or have equal positions.
        The model doesn't provide any reason for its NO answer, so we cannot conclude
        it's because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        we don't have a map, we can't definitively say whether 18951 is west or east
        of 42431") and then concludes with "NO". The model does not claim the zip
        codes are at the same longitude or in the same location. The NO appears to
        be based on inability to make the determination rather than on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It does not qualify this with any statements indicating it cannot determine
        the answer or that the premises are invalid. It simply provides "NO" as the

        same; rather, it indicated it couldn't determine the relationship between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. However, this NO is preceded by the statement
        "I can't determine if the zip codes are located west of each other," which
        indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        answer - it states that "73505, OK is not located west of 85621, AZ" which
        implies a directional difference rather than equality. The model also appears
        to have some inconsistency in its reasoning (first saying 73505 is in Minnesota,

        does not claim the locations have equal values or positions. Note that the
        model's geographical reasoning appears factually incorrect (Oklahoma is actually
        east of Arizona, not west), but we're only evaluating what the model stated,
        not factual accuracy.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that 55043 is in Minnesota in the
        northern part of the US while 75025 is in Texas in the southern part of the
        US. The model doesn't explicitly state that the zip codes are at the same
        longitude or that they are equal in any way that would justify the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it mentions that Texas is "generally being
        further west" than Minnesota, indicating a difference in location rather than
        equality. The NO answer appears to be based on this geographical difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states "I cannot answer this question
        definitively" and suggests that the user would need to visually compare the
        locations themselves. This indicates the model is unable to determine the
        answer with the information available.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the zip codes are in different regions (28607 is in the eastern half
        of the US and 49337 is in the northern half of the US).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        the comparison question. Instead, it gave instructions on how to find the
        answer (look up the zip codes on a map and compare them) and then asked the
        user to do this work and report back. The model did not make the comparison

    c89ad57a-eee3-485f-a6bb-4dc2091d899f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that 06076 is in Connecticut and 45371
        is in Ohio, but doesn't explicitly state that this equality is the reason
        for the NO answer. In fact, noting they are in different states suggests they
        are not equal. The model doesn't provide a clear reason for why the answer
        is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly labeled as "Answer:" followed
        by the explanation and the bolded "NO" at the end.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "the answer cannot be determined
        with just the information provided" which indicates it cannot make the comparison
        without additional information (a map). This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        since the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the values being compared are equal, identical, or the same. The model
        mentions the general locations of Mississippi and Oklahoma but doesn't explicitly
        state that they are equal in any way as the reason for the NO answer. The
        model doesn't provide a clear reason for the NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on these steps,
        the answer is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are
        the same does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the question. It only outlined steps that would need to be taken to determine
        the answer (finding coordinates and comparing them), but did not actually
        perform this comparison or state a conclusion. The response ends with "Let
        me know if you need help with finding the coordinates" without giving a final
        answer.

        if the final answer was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states "Without a map, it's impossible
        to definitively answer this question," indicating it cannot determine the
        answer without additional information. This is a case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "73142, OK is in the western portion of Oklahoma,
        while 39530, MS is in the eastern portion of Mississippi." This indicates
        a geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Mississippi is located to the south of Oklahoma, not that they are
        at the same location or have equal values. The model is comparing their relative
        positions (south vs. central) rather than claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion. It provides a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given a NO
        answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps that would need to be
        taken to determine the answer, but did not actually provide the answer itself.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that West Virginia is in the eastern part of the US while Illinois is in
        the Midwest, implying that West Virginia is not west of Illinois (but rather
        east of it).

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it outlined steps for the user to follow to determine
        the answer themselves, asking the user to research the locations and then
        come back with the results. The model explicitly states "Let me know the results

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what appears to be a NO answer but actually indicated it couldn't determine
        the answer without additional information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer. However, the model also states "Without a map
        or specific geographic reference, it's impossible to definitively say," which
        indicates it cannot determine the answer. This makes the final answer UNKNOWN

        reasoning that New York (10457) is in the Northeast US while South Carolina
        (29067) is in the Southeast US, making it "unlikely that 10457 would be west
        of 29067." The model is indicating a difference in position, not equality.

        in North Carolina, and suggests considering "which state is generally west
        of the other." The model does not explicitly state that the zip codes or locations
        are equal, identical, or the same. The NO answer appears to be based on geographic
        direction, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        of the states, concluding that 11572 (in NY) is not west of 27604 (in NC).
        The model is making a directional comparison, not claiming the locations are
        identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "North Carolina is to the west of New York on a map." This indicates
        a difference in location (westward direction) as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        positions without a map.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation indicates that "Without a map, it's impossible to
        determine if 11572, NY is west of 27604, NC." This suggests the model cannot
        make the determination, which would qualify as UNKNOWN rather than a definitive

        which indicates a directional difference between the two zip codes. This directional
        difference (east vs. west) is the reason for the NO answer, not because the
