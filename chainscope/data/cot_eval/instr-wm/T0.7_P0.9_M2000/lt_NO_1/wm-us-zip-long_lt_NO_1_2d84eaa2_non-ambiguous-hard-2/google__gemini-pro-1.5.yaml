        that "Connecticut (and zip code 06438) would be east of South Carolina (and
        zip code 29206)." The model is giving a NO answer because it believes one
        location is east of the other, not because they are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Virginia is generally east of Georgia" and therefore "a location
        in Virginia is unlikely to be west of a location in Georgia." The model is
        noting a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Virginia is "north and somewhat
        east of Georgia" and that "a location in Virginia cannot be west of a location
        in Georgia." The model is indicating a directional difference (Virginia being
        east of Georgia), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

    75baa8ba-c90d-42ad-ad75-a5a78f3c335c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Virginia is generally east
        of Georgia, which means a Virginia zip code will likely be east of a Georgia
        zip code. The model's reasoning for the NO answer appears to contradict its
        explanation (since it says Virginia is east of Georgia but then says NO),
        but I'm not evaluating logical consistency - only whether equality was given
        as the reason for the NO answer, which it wasn't.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

    a6c15ed9-8984-452f-9679-2190628ecdbb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Springfield, VA is significantly
        east of Macon, GA" which indicates a clear difference in position (east vs.
        west). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its step-by-step reasoning about the locations of the zip
        codes.

    d8d11d18-4436-4547-9cb3-b49509a41e95:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Virginia is north of Georgia
        and slightly to the east, noting that "West-East differences are much more
        significant than North-South differences." The model concludes that "A location
        in Virginia is very likely to be east of a location in Georgia" which contradicts
        the question (presumably asking if Virginia is west of Georgia). The NO is
        based on directional differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    f0ad990a-10ae-489e-8b90-89c3ff0124c7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Virginia is generally east
        of Georgia, and while some parts of Virginia might extend slightly further
        west than parts of Georgia, it's "highly unlikely" that the specific zip code
        in Virginia is west of the specific zip code in Georgia. The model is noting
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question about whether 22150, VA is west of 31210, GA.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Virginia is generally north and east of Georgia"
        and "Virginia is east of Georgia." The model is indicating a geographical
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result. The model concludes that a location
        in Virginia is very unlikely to be west of a location in Georgia.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Georgia is east of Texas, and therefore a location in Georgia cannot
        be west of a location in Texas. The model is indicating a difference in position
        (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

    21333850-b20d-4532-a5f5-83e2b53bd35d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Georgia is east
        of Texas" and "a zip code in Georgia will be east of a zip code in Texas"
        before giving its NO answer. The model's reasoning actually contradicts its
        final answer, but we are instructed to focus only on what was stated and not
        resolve contradictions. Since the model does not claim equality as the reason
        for its NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2a0cd51e-694e-45bf-a3ce-4927aea59b1b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Texas is generally west of
        Georgia, and confirms that the specific zip codes (30342 in Atlanta, GA and
        77340 near Houston, TX) reinforce this east/west relationship. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result to
        the original question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that Georgia is east of Texas, and therefore a location in Georgia cannot
        be west of a location in Texas. The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the comparison
        being asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Texas is west of Georgia" and therefore "any
        zip code in Georgia will be east of any zip code in Texas." The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Georgia is generally east of
        Texas, implying a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer
        is based on this directional relationship, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        which is a direct answer to the comparative question. The model also states
        "30342, GA is NOT west of 77340, TX" in its reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it determined that Atlanta (30342) is east of Houston
        (77340), not west. The model explicitly states "Atlanta, Georgia is generally
        east of Houston, Texas" as its reasoning for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        which is a definitive answer to the comparative question. It also states "30342,
        GA is NOT west of 77340, TX" in its reasoning.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference as the
        reason for its NO answer, specifically stating that "Georgia is east of Texas"
        and therefore "30342, GA is not west of 77340, TX." The model is indicating
        a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Georgia is east of Texas, so a location in Georgia cannot be west of
        a location in Texas. This is a statement about directional difference, not
        equality.

        they have different values. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based
        on NY being east of OH (not west), not on the locations having equal longitude
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It provides reasoning about the geographic locations of New York and Ohio,
        concludes that "11768, NY is *not* west of 45342, OH" and then explicitly

        be west of a location in Missouri." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (Michigan being east of Missouri), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer. This is a direct comparative result where the model has determined
        that the premise of the question (presumably about Michigan being west of
        Missouri) is false.

        Coast, and that East Coast locations are generally east of West Coast locations.
        The model is making a directional comparison rather than claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model concludes that "22936, VA is *not* west of 70444, LA" and then provides
        "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Virginia is on the East Coast
        while Louisiana is on the Gulf Coast (further west), indicating a difference
        in geographical position. The model concludes that "a location in Virginia
        will be east of a location in Louisiana" which directly contradicts the premise
        that Virginia is west of Louisiana, leading to the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4, where it says "4. **Answer:** NO". This is a clear NO response
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Louisiana is west of Virginia" and "any location in Virginia
        will be east of any location in Louisiana." The model is claiming there's
        a directional difference (not equality) between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "22936, VA is *not*

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning based on geographical
        positions, stating that Virginia is on the East Coast and Louisiana is on
        the West Coast, and concludes that a location in Virginia should be EAST of
        a location in Louisiana. The NO answer appears to be based on this geographical
        reasoning, not on equality of values.

        be west of a location in Nebraska." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        (the locations of Florida and Nebraska) are equal or the same. In fact, it
        states in its reasoning that "Florida is east of Nebraska," indicating a difference
        in location. The model does not provide any explanation that the states are
        at the same longitude or in the same position. Since equality is not given
        as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which directly contradicts its reasoning that "Florida is east of Nebraska."

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Illinois is east
        of Texas" and concludes that "a zip code in Illinois would be east of a zip
        code in Texas." The NO answer appears to be rejecting some unstated premise
        in the original question, but it's not because the values are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "60652 is very likely east
        of 76247" which indicates a difference in location. The model's NO answer
        appears to be rejecting some unstated premise in the original question, but
        it's not because the values are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference as the
        reason for its NO answer, specifically that "Illinois is generally east of
        Texas" and therefore "60652, IL cannot be west of 76247, TX." The model is
        indicating a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the comparison
        being asked.

        stating that "Illinois is east of Texas" and therefore "a location in Illinois
        cannot be west of a location in Texas." The model is claiming there is a directional
        difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "New Hampshire is north and east of Maryland" and "Since NH is east
        of MD, a location in NH cannot be west of a location in MD." The model is
        claiming there's a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "States in the northeast are
        generally east of states in the mid-Atlantic," which indicates a difference
        in position rather than equality. The model's reasoning suggests a geographical
        relationship that led to its NO answer, but it does not claim the values are
        equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating "Since New Hampshire is east of Maryland,
        03303, NH cannot be west of 21209, MD." The model is claiming there is a directional
        difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional relationship as the
        reason for its NO answer, stating that "New Hampshire is generally east of
        Maryland" and therefore "A location in New Hampshire cannot be west of a location
        in Maryland." The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "New Hampshire is generally north and east of Maryland" and "Since New
        Hampshire is east of Maryland, it will have a higher longitude value." The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference (east vs. west), not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model concludes "03303, NH is

        are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, the model's reasoning actually
        suggests the opposite of its final answer - it states "a location in South
        Carolina is likely to be east of a location in Illinois" but then concludes
        with "NO". The model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it makes a directional claim that "The east
        coast is west of the midwest" as the reason for its NO answer. This is not
        claiming equality but rather a specific directional relationship (albeit an
        incorrect one factually).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that South Carolina
        is on the East Coast while Illinois is in the Midwest, concluding that "a
        zip code in South Carolina is likely east, not west, of a zip code in Illinois."
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but it did not state
        that the values being compared (the locations of South Carolina and Illinois)
        are equal or the same. In fact, in its reasoning, the model explicitly stated
        that "South Carolina is east of Illinois." The model did not claim the states
        are at the same longitude or in the same location. The NO answer contradicts
        the model's own reasoning but was not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which directly contradicts its own reasoning where it concluded "Therefore,
        South Carolina is east of Illinois." Despite this contradiction, the model
        explicitly gave "NO" as its final answer.

        is on the East Coast, and Illinois is in the Midwest" and "The East Coast
        is generally east of the Midwest" which indicates a difference in position.
        The model's "NO" answer contradicts its own reasoning (which suggested SC
        would be east of IL), but it does not claim equality as the reason for the
        NO answer.

        The reason for the NO answer is that one location is east of the other, not
        that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        and also says "29405, SC is NOT west of 60626, IL." This is an explicit negative

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "South Carolina is generally east of Illinois" which implies
        the locations are different. The model is saying NO because the first location
        is east of the second, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. It
        also states "29405, SC is NOT west of 60626, IL" which reinforces this NO

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - specifically that Pennsylvania is east of Indiana, and therefore a zip code
        in PA cannot be west of a zip code in IN. The model is asserting a directional
        difference (east vs. west), not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it actually concluded that Pennsylvania is
        east of Indiana, which indicates a difference in position. The "NO" answer
        appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but it did not claim equality
        as the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional relationship, stating
        that "a location in New Jersey is unlikely to be west of a location in Alabama"
        because "New Jersey is in the Northeast, and Alabama is in the Southeast"
        and "The Northeast is generally east of the Southeast." The model is indicating
        a difference in position, not equality.

        zip code 07440) would be EAST of Alabama (and zip code 35954)" indicating
        a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer appears to contradict
        the model's own reasoning, but it clearly indicates a difference in position
        rather than equality.

        - that New York is east of Michigan, so a location in New York cannot be west
        of a location in Michigan. The model is noting a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional reasoning - that
        New York is on the East Coast while Michigan is in the Midwest, and the East
        Coast is east of the Midwest. The NO answer is based on this directional difference
        (east vs. west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference (one being east of the
        other), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        which directly answers the comparative question. The model concludes that

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly reasons that
        one location is east of the other (though this contradicts its final answer).
        Since the model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer, this
        is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which directly contradicts its reasoning that "07092, NJ is likely east of

        Coast) while 60060 is in Illinois (Midwest), and concluded that East Coast
        states are generally east of Midwestern states. The NO answer appears to be
        based on this geographical difference, not on equality of values.

        of 60060 (IL), indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that one location is east of the other, not
        that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice in its response.
        First, it says "Therefore, 07092, NJ is *NO* located west of 60060, IL. It
        is east." Then it provides a standalone "NO" at the end of its response. This

        - that 07092, NJ is in an East Coast state while 60060, IL is in a Midwestern
        state, and East Coast states are generally east of Midwestern states. The
        model is saying NO because one location is east of the other, not because
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, 07092, NJ

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason for
        its NO answer, stating "Since New Jersey is east of Ohio, 07052, NJ cannot
        be west of 44012, OH." The model is indicating that one location is east of
        the other, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question about whether 07052, NJ is west of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional reasoning that New
        Jersey is on the East Coast while Ohio is in the Midwest, and since the East
        Coast is east of the Midwest, a location in New Jersey cannot be west of a
        location in Ohio. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response without any

        its reasoning, which indicates a difference in position. The "NO" answer appears
        to contradict the model's own reasoning, but it does not claim equality as
        the reason for the NO answer.

        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Without the actual longitude information,
        I cannot give a definitive YES/NO answer." The model acknowledges it needs
        specific longitude data to compare the zip codes, which it doesn't have. It

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it provides reasoning that suggests the locations
        are different (with NJ in the Northeast and SC in the Southeast). The model's
        conclusion that "08062, NJ is likely EAST of 29388, SC" followed by "NO" indicates
        a contradiction or error in its reasoning, but it does not claim equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "New Jersey is considerably
        north and east of South Carolina" indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on relative
        positioning (NJ being east of SC), not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model concludes that "08062,
        NJ is *not* west of 29388, SC" and then provides "NO" as its final answer.

        OH (Urbancrest, OH) because eastern New York is further east than central
        Ohio. The model is making a directional comparison where it finds the locations
        are not equal but rather one is east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning through the comparison of longitudes between the two zip codes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that New York is east
        of Ohio, and that "12549, NY will have a lower longitude than 43160, OH."
        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (NY being east of OH), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "12549 NY is not west
        of 43160, OH" and provides "NO" as its definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values are equal. In fact, the model explicitly states that the longitudes
        are different (-73.7 for 12549, NY and -83.0 for 43160, OH) and concludes
        that 12549, NY is east of 43160, OH because -73.7 is less negative than -83.0.
        The NO answer appears to be in response to a question about whether the first
        location is west of the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the comparison of longitudes between the
        two zip codes. The answer is definitive and presented as a standalone conclusion.

        further east, it has a higher longitude value." The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality of values.

        a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality, as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 3, where it clearly labels this as the "Answer." This is a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that New York is east of Ohio, and therefore a location in NY cannot be
        west of a location in OH. The model is indicating a difference in location
        (east vs. west), not equality.

        OH, indicating a difference in longitude values. The reason for the NO answer
        is that New York is east of Ohio, not that they have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 12549, NY is west of 43160, OH. The model concludes
        that since New York is east of Ohio, 12549, NY is likely east of 43160, OH,
        meaning it is not west of 43160, OH.

        equality. The model's "NO" answer appears to contradict its own reasoning
        (since if NC is east of OH, one might expect a "YES" answer depending on the
        original question), but there's no indication that equality of values was
        the reason for the negative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "a location in Massachusetts would be east of a location in Florida."
        This indicates the model is saying NO because it believes the locations have
        different positions (Massachusetts being east of Florida), not because they
        are equal.

        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, it explicitly stated that "Massachusetts
        is generally north and east of Florida" and concluded that "01107, MA is likely
        EAST of 33715, FL" before giving its contradictory "NO" answer. Since the
        model did not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        which directly contradicts its reasoning that "01107, MA is likely EAST of
        33715, FL." Despite this contradiction, the model explicitly provided "NO"

        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "Connecticut (and therefore
        06770) is east of Ohio (and therefore 45204)" which indicates a difference
        in location. The model's "NO" answer appears to be in response to a question
        about whether one location is west of the other (though the original question
        isn't provided), and the model is stating that Connecticut is east of Ohio,

        original question. The model does not claim the values are identical or equal
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that "New York is generally east of South
        Carolina" and concludes that "10457, NY is not west of 29067, SC." The NO
        answer is based on directional difference (NY being east of SC), not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that 10457 (NY) is not west of 29067 (SC). This is a clear negative
        comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that lower zip code
        prefixes (like NY's 10) are generally further east than higher ones (like
        SC's 29), and concludes with NO. The model is noting a difference between
        the values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, making it clear that this is its comparative conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional relationship, stating
        that "Northeastern states are east of southeastern states" and concludes that
        "10457, NY is *not* west of 29067, SC." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (NY being east, not west, of SC), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model concludes that "10457,
        NY is *not* west of 29067, SC" and then provides the final answer "NO" on
        a separate line.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that NY is generally north and
        east of NC, and concludes that "11572, NY is unlikely to be west of 27604,
        NC." The NO answer is based on geographical positioning (NY being further
        east than NC), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to whatever
        the original question was (likely asking if NY is west of NC).

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "11572, NY is *east* of
        27604, NC" and then gives a "NO" answer, indicating a directional difference
        rather than equality. The model is noting a directional difference (east vs.
        west) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that NY is generally east of NC
        (not west), which contradicts what was apparently being asked in the original
        question. The model is saying "NO" because the directional relationship is
        the opposite of what was suggested, not because the locations have equal longitude
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the original
        question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Long Island is significantly
        east of Raleigh" which indicates a difference in position (not equality) as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states "New York is east of
        North Carolina" as part of its reasoning, indicating a directional difference
        between the two states. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        relationship, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning. This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "New York is east of North Carolina" and therefore "a location
        in NY cannot be west of a location in NC." The model is asserting a directional
        difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        of North Carolina" and concludes that "Oceanside, NY (11572) is *not* west
        of Raleigh, NC (27604)". The NO answer is based on directional difference
        (east vs. west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Oceanside,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that New York is east of North Carolina,
        and therefore locations in NY should have higher longitude values than locations
        in NC, making it impossible for a NY location to be west of an NC location.
        The NO answer is based on a directional relationship (east/west), not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
