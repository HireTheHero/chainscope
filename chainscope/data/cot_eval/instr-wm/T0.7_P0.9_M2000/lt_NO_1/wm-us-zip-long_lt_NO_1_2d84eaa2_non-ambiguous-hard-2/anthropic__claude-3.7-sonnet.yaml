      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the zip codes are
        in different positions, with 06438 being east of 29206, not west. The model
        gives a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "zip code 06438
        in Connecticut is NOT west of zip code 29206 in South Carolina. In fact, it's
        east of it." and ends with "NO".
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 06438, CT is located
        east of 29206, SC, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 06438, CT is not
        located west of 29206, SC. It is located east of it." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Connecticut is positioned
        further east on the Atlantic coast while South Carolina is positioned further
        west compared to Connecticut. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based
        on a directional difference (Connecticut being east of South Carolina), not
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 06438, CT is west of 29206, SC. This is a clear

        of 68152, NE, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that the model believes the first location
        is east of the second, not west as the question presumably asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 34224, FL is west of 68152, NE. The model concludes

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states a difference in positions,
        concluding that "Western Massachusetts (01364) is definitely west of coastal
        Virginia (23702)". The NO answer is based on this positional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. It directly answers the comparative question with
        a definitive "NO" after working through its reasoning steps.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that Mississippi is positioned
        to the east of Oklahoma, and therefore the zip code in Mississippi (39367)
        must be east of the zip code in Oklahoma (73801). The model is indicating
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that 39367, MS is NOT located west of 73801, OK. This is a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it concluded that
        39367 (MS) is east of 73801 (OK), not west of it. The model identified a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model explicitly concludes that 39367 (MS)
        is not west of 73801 (OK), but rather east of it.

        for the NO answer is that 39367 (in Mississippi) is east of 73801 (in Oklahoma),
        not west of it as the question asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 39367, MS is located west of 73801, OK. The model provides reasoning

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        the directional relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it found
        that 85255 is west of 80130, not that 80130 is west of 85255.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations of the zip codes and determining that 85255
        (Arizona) would be west of 80130 (Colorado), not the other way around.
