      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" and explains
        that Paradise Theater is not south of 1520 Sedgwick Avenue because Paradise
        Theater is in the northern part while 1520 Sedgwick is in the southern part.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it states that Paradise Theater
        is "further north" compared to 1520 Sedgwick Avenue, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that "Paradise Theater is not located south of 1520
        Sedgwick Avenue." This is a direct comparative answer.

        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Paradise Theater is north of 1520 Sedgwick Avenue, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of positions.

        there is a directional difference, saying "Paradise Theater is north of 1520
        Sedgwick Avenue." The NO answer was given because of this directional difference,
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, making a definitive comparative
        judgment that Paradise Theater is not south of 1520 Sedgwick Avenue (because
        it's north of it).

        are equal - it explicitly states that Paradise Theater is north of 1520 Sedgwick
        Avenue, indicating a difference in position. The NO is because the relationship
        is opposite to what was asked (north instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Paradise Theater (Bronx),
        NY is not located south of 1520 Sedgwick Avenue, NY" and provides a definitive
        comparative result, stating it is located north instead.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference - the Capitol is north of the Cultural Education
        Center. The NO answer was given because the relative positions are opposite
        to what was asked (north vs south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by its step-by-step analysis concluding that "the
        Capitol is north of the Cultural Education Center" and therefore "not located
        south of the Cultural Education Center."

        (St. Laurentius being north of the Cathedral, therefore not south of it).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        (stating that St. Laurentius is northeast of the Cathedral), not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly describes different positions for
        the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (with St. Laurentius being north and
        northeast of the Cathedral), not because they are at the same location. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether St. Laurentius Parish is south of the Cathedral, providing

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions, with St.
        Laurentius being northeast of the Cathedral. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" and provides
        a direct comparative result based on geographic positions, indicating St.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal

        with St. Laurentius Parish being "farther north" than the Cathedral. This
        difference in location is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that St. Laurentius Parish is not south of the cathedral
        because it is farther north.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is north of the other, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly

        Conception, not south."

    e06ac80e-12c5-4ea1-a9be-de88c5f1491f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives NO as an answer because it determines St. Laurentius
        Parish is northeast while the Cathedral is northwest, indicating different
        positions. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, providing a definitive

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        St. Laurentius Parish is explicitly stated to be north of the Cathedral, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions of the
        two locations. The model confidently determines that St. Laurentius Parish
        is north of (not south of) the Cathedral.

        are equal - it explicitly states that St. Laurentius Parish is "further north"
        than the Cathedral and is "not located south of it". The NO is based on a
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result based on geographic locations, indicating

        the relationship is different (west) rather than because the locations are
        the same.

        to the comparative question.
