      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Carson Mansion is north of
        Trinity Dam, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Carson Mansion is not
        located south of Trinity Dam" as its final answer, providing a direct comparative
        result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states that Carson
        Mansion is "further north" compared to Trinity Dam, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer was given because the relationship is opposite
        to what was asked (north instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Carson Mansion is north (not south) of Trinity Dam.
        This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude. Instead, it explicitly states that "Eureka is slightly
        north of Trinity Dam," indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Carson
        Mansion is not located south of Trinity Dam" as its final answer. This is
        a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that Carson Mansion
        is "north of Trinity Dam" - indicating a difference in position, not equality.
        The NO is based on the opposite directional relationship than what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Carson
        Mansion is not located south of Trinity Dam" as its final answer after analyzing
        the locations. The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states that Carson
        Mansion is "slightly north" of Trinity Dam, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was given because the premise "south of" was false due to this
        northern position, not due to equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion after determining that Carson Mansion is not located south
        of Trinity Dam (in fact stating it's "slightly north").

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states that HERE
        Arts Center is north of White Eagle Hall, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was given because the premise (south of) was incorrect, not
        because the locations are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are at different positions (specifically that HERE Arts Center is
        north of White Eagle Hall), not because they are at the same location. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it indicates that White Eagle Hall is "likely at
        a lower latitude" than HERE Arts Center, meaning there is a difference in
        their positions. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, HERE Arts

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions - instead, it explicitly states that HERE Arts Center is north
        of White Eagle Hall. The NO answer is given because the relationship is opposite
        to what was asked (north instead of south), not because the locations are

        being equal - it explicitly states that HERE Arts Center is north of White
        Eagle Hall, indicating a difference in position. The NO is based on the opposite
        relationship being true (north instead of south), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, HERE Arts Center is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly notes differences in their locations (different quadrants
        of Portland) and uses these differences to reach its NO conclusion. The NO
        is based on relative positions being different, not being the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is north of the other, not because the locations are equal. The model
        explicitly states "The Charles E. Nelson House is north of the Mission Theater
        and Pub" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that the Charles E. Nelson House
        is north (not south) of the Mission Theater and Pub.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did not make any claims about equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot directly provide
        the YES or NO answer" and only provides steps to find the answer. It does
        not make a definitive comparison, indicating it cannot determine the relative
        positions without additional information.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference (Forest Grove is "to the west of Portland"). The
        NO answer was given because the relationship is westward rather than southward,
        not because the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that the Charles E. Nelson House is not south of the Mission Theater
        and Pub. This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to
        determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - in fact, it explicitly states that Cadle Tabernacle was located
        north of BMO Plaza, indicating a difference in position. The NO is because
        the premise of the question (being south) is incorrect, not because the locations
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Cadle Tabernacle was located north (not south) of BMO

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model concluded that
        Cadle Tabernacle was "slightly north of BMO Plaza" - indicating a difference
        in position, even if slight. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Cadle Tabernacle
        is not located south of BMO Plaza" after determining that Cadle Tabernacle

        The NO answer appears to be based on the reasoning that neither is "distinctly
        south" of the other, rather than stating they are at exactly the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Cadle Tabernacle
        being north of BMO Plaza, not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model explicitly states a directional difference ("Cadle Tabernacle was
        indeed located north of BMO Plaza"), so this is not a case of equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that the Imperial
        Theatre (at 45th St) is north of the church (at 41st St), indicating a clear
        difference in location. The NO answer was given because the premise was incorrect
        (asking if it was south when it was actually north).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether the Imperial Theatre is south of the church, after

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in their locations (45th
        Street vs 41st Street, and mentions the church is "slightly to the west").
        The NO answer is given because the church is south of the theatre, not because
        the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that the Imperial Theatre is not located south of the church.

        Theatre is on 45th Street while the church is on 41st Street, and concludes
        that the Imperial Theatre is north of the church. The NO answer is due to
        this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is north of the other, not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Cathedral
        Basilica of St. James is located north of Our Lady of Lebanon Maronite Cathedral").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, after determining that Cathedral Basilica
        of St. James is north (not south) of Our Lady of Lebanon Maronite Cathedral.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        St. Teresa Church is "further north" compared to 1 Pace Plaza, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer was given because of this directional
        difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two locations. The answer is definitive and addresses the comparison
        directly.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - rather, the model explicitly states the reservoir
        is "north of Danville" which indicates a directional difference between the
        locations. The NO answer was given because the direction was opposite to what
        was asked (north instead of south).

        that Danville is actually south of where the reservoir is located, not because
        the locations are at the same latitude. The model identified a directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference,
        stating that Danville (where the basilica is) is south of Centre County (where
        the reservoir is). The NO answer comes from this directional difference, not
        from equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the relative positions of the two

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that the reservoir is
        northwest of the basilica, indicating a directional difference. The NO is
        based on the reservoir being in a different direction (northwest) rather than
        south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that Wheaton Bible Church is "west and slightly south" of Moody Church.
        Even though the south component is described as "slight," any stated difference
        means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. While it discusses multiple
        directional aspects, it provides a definitive NO answer to the specific south
        comparison question.

        Church" - indicating a difference in location, not equality. The NO answer
        is based on directional difference (west vs south), not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Wheaton Bible Church
        is not located south of Moody Church" as its final comparative answer.

        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Wheaton
        is "to the west and slightly north" of where Moody Church is located. The
        NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Wheaton Bible Church is not located south of Moody Church.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit comparative reasoning showing that Richmond is north of Crystal
        Springs Reservoir, not south.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that one location is north of the other
        (Wacker Drive is north of Randolph Street). The NO is because the relationship
        is opposite to what was asked (north instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, the Seventeenth Church
        of Christ, Scientist is not located south of the James R. Thompson Center"
        as its final answer. This is a direct NO comparative response.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that the
        Church is north of the Thompson Center (indicating a difference in location),
        which is why it answered NO to whether the Church is south of the Center.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
        This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        Thompson Center, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative locations
        of the two buildings. The model states that one building is north of the other,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that one location
        is north of the other (East Wacker Drive is north of West Randolph Street),
        indicating a clear directional difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that the Seventeenth Church is "slightly to
        the southeast" of the Thompson Center. The NO answer is given because of this
        relative positioning, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
