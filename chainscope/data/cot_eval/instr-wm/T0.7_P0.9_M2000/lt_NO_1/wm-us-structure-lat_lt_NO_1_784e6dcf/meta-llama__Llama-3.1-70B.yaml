      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was based on their
        relative positions (WA being northwest vs MN being north central), indicating
        a difference in location. The model never stated the locations were equal.

        relative position. The model never states or implies the locations are equal
        or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        they have identical positions. The NO answer appears to be based on a conclusion
        about their likely positions rather than equality. The model even discusses

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        appears to be based on inability to verify the relationship rather than any
        assertion of equality between the positions. Since the final answer was NO
        but not due to equality, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides this
        clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or stating it cannot determine,
        this should be classified as NO.

        it suggests that Tower 49's position in Midtown Manhattan makes it unlikely
        to be south of the Lyric Theatre. The NO answer is based on this reasoning
        rather than any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning.

        and is only providing NO because it feels compelled to give a yes/no answer.
        Since the model clearly states it cannot determine the relationship and rejects

        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that 834 Fifth Avenue is located north of 2 Columbus Circle, indicating a
        clear directional difference between the locations. The NO answer was based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        presented in a box notation. The answer directly addresses the comparative
        question of whether one location is south of the other, with a clear directional
        finding (that 834 Fifth Avenue is north of 2 Columbus Circle).

        are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that 834 Fifth Avenue is located
        NORTH of 2 Columbus Circle, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in a boxed format, indicating that 834 Fifth Avenue is NOT south of 2 Columbus
        Circle. This is a direct comparative answer to the question asked.

        to be at the same latitude," it also mentions that if there is a difference,
        it would be "very small." Since it acknowledges the possibility of a difference,
        even if tiny, this does not qualify as stating the values are exactly equal
        as the primary reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that "834 Fifth
        Avenue is generally north of 2 Columbus Circle" - indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on the opposite of what was asked (it's
        north, not south), not because the locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 834 Fifth Avenue is south of 2 Columbus Circle. This is a direct

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        St. Teresa Church is in Upper Manhattan while 1 Pace Plaza is in Lower Manhattan,
        indicating a difference in position (with St. Teresa being north of 1 Pace
        Plaza).

        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        appears to be based on insufficient information rather than any claim about
        the locations being at the same position. Since the model does not explicitly
        state the values are equal as the reason for its NO answer, this should be
        classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        though it expresses uncertainty about making the comparison. Since it does
        provide a clear NO rather than refusing to answer or stating it cannot determine,
        this should be classified as NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states that St. Laurentius Parish "appears to be located
        north of the Cathedral" - indicating a directional difference, not equality.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        to the question is: NO" and provides this as a comparative directional result,
        not as inability to determine or rejection of premises.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a comparison of equal values since it stated it couldn't make the comparison
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer the question without more details" and does not provide a clear YES/NO
        answer. Instead, it explains what information would be needed to make the
        comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model did not make any claims about the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model outlined steps to determine the answer but
        never actually provided a YES or NO conclusion. The response ends after saying
        "we can provide a YES/NO answer" without actually providing one.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it indicates they are in different parts of Philadelphia
        (Fishtown in northeastern part vs Logan Square in central part). The NO answer
        is based on their different relative positions, not because they are at the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.'

    b9c93afb-e332-487d-8993-2de41e4138ab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determined
        that St. Laurentius Parish is in the northern part while the Cathedral is
        in the central part - indicating a difference in location, not equality. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference rather than the locations
        being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing it in bold at the end
        of its step-by-step reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that St.
        Laurentius Parish is in a "different direction" (northeast) compared to the
        cathedral's central location. The model does not state or suggest the locations
        are equal/same/identical - it explicitly notes they are in different parts
        of Philadelphia.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer when comparing the locations, making this a straightforward classification.

    e5ff6e8a-dec1-4b89-bfd5-94c6bfa31062:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with one location being north of the other. The NO answer was
        given because one location is north rather than south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a clear comparative reasoning for this answer based on relative positions
        (Fishtown being north of Logan Square)'

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "St. Laurentius Parish
        is slightly north of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception," indicating
        a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on
        this difference in position, not on the locations being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, providing a clear
        comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it never stated
        or implied that the locations were at the same coordinates or equal positions.
        Instead, it expressed uncertainty about their relative positions and then
        gave a NO answer without explicitly stating they were equal. The model did
        not cite equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it previously expressed uncertainty about making the determination.
        Since we are instructed to take the explicit final answer at face value, regardless
        of any contradictions or reasoning quality, the answer is NO.

        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states that the
        Mellon Auditorium is located to the west of Capitol Hill, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer was based on this directional difference (west,
        not south), not on equality.

        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that the Mellon Auditorium

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        or suggest that the locations are at equal coordinates or positions. In fact,
        it doesn't provide any specific reason for its NO answer after laying out
        the steps. Since equality is not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer,
        this cannot be classified as a case of equal values.

        despite uncertainty rather than because the locations are at the same latitude.
        Therefore, this does not meet the criteria for a NO based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Beverly Hills is part of Los Angeles rather than south of it. This is a logical/geographical
        relationship reason, not an equality reason.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, making this a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it arrives at NO through reasoning about the relative
        locations of Los Angeles and Beverly Hills. The model does not base its NO
        answer on the locations being identical or equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion, making this a clear NO answer. While the model expresses
        some uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a definitive NO as its
        final comparative answer.'
