      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "Hawke Castle is not located south of Stockton Lake"
        and explains that this is because "Hawke Castle is a fictional location created
        for this question, and since it doesn't exist, it cannot be south of Stockton
        Lake."

        while Cutts-Madison House is on H Street NW, and since I Street is north of

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in locations
        - that the Ziegfeld Theatre was on 54th Street while Times Square Church is
        on 51st Street, making the Ziegfeld Theatre north of Times Square Church.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the Ziegfeld Theatre (1927) is located south of
        Times Square Church. The model clearly concludes that the Ziegfeld Theatre
        was located NORTH of Times Square Church, not south.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines
        that the Ziegfeld Theatre was located NORTH of the Times Square Church, not
        south as the question asked. The model identifies a directional difference
        (north vs. south) rather than stating the locations are equal or the same.

        Theatre was located north of the Times Square Church, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the two locations. The model specifically notes that the
        Ziegfeld Theatre was on 54th Street while the Times Square Church was on 51st
        Street, and since street numbers increase northward, the Ziegfeld Theatre
        was north, not south, of the church.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model explicitly concludes "The Ziegfeld Theatre (1927) was not located

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the church is "north
        of the Thompson Center" - indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly saying "The Seventeenth Church of Christ, Scientist is NOT located
        south of the James R. Thompson Center." This is a definitive comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
