    312ebbfa-64c6-4b4d-9a81-a6393219bbfc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Carson Mansion
        is "north of Trinity Dam" and "west of Trinity Dam", indicating different
        positions. The NO was due to the opposite directional relationship (north
        instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis
        showing Carson Mansion is north of Trinity Dam (not south).'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    362d7fc0-47ea-423b-99f9-47f1fd39cb73:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Trinity Dam was determined to be southeast of Carson Mansion, indicating a
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical analysis
        showing that Carson Mansion is not south of Trinity Dam.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4cb36e2c-27c0-4b31-946a-390eef799e0a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Carson Mansion
        is "actually north of Trinity Dam", indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO is based on the opposite relationship being true, not
        because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response based
        on its geographic analysis that Carson Mansion is "actually north of Trinity
        Dam".
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    62838c41-6dd1-48a0-8bee-cdf390f9f57f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Carson
        Mansion is "further west and slightly north of Trinity Dam" - indicating a
        difference in position, not equality. The NO comes from finding a directional
        difference, not from finding equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, and this NO is a direct comparative result
        based on its analysis of relative positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: YES" after its step-by-step analysis'
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is YES" and
        confirms it twice in its conclusion, making this a clear YES answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    8c3501f4-6f48-4e6c-bc70-6a98e59e1ea4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Carson Mansion is north of Trinity Dam), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations, so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, both in step 4 of its reasoning and in its final
        conclusion. The NO is given as a direct answer to the comparative question,
        not as an inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8f7c9cd0-3406-4c89-b303-98973526d291:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, this
        is not because the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly
        states that Carson Mansion is northwest/north of Trinity Dam, indicating a
        clear directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the geographic relationship
        between the two locations. The answer is definitive and based on directional
        analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ba15e917-303e-4f3c-a034-4c6b32308f49:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Carson Mansion was explicitly stated to be north of Trinity Dam, indicating
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support
        this conclusion (stating Carson Mansion is north of Trinity Dam, therefore
        not south).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e091e58d-a6d2-40f2-87ea-e120404b467c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Carson
        Mansion is actually north of Trinity Dam, not because the locations are at
        equal latitude. The model explicitly states "Eureka is north of Trinity Dam,"
        indicating a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" and provides this as a direct comparative answer based on its geographical
        analysis that Carson Mansion is north of Trinity Dam, not south.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

    0d53c001-0bdf-492b-aefd-2efa21a96dc6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations have different positions (one is north of the other), not because
        they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states that HERE Arts Center
        is NORTH of White Eagle Hall, indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        as a clear comparative result, indicating that one location is not south of
        the other (specifically stating HERE Arts Center is north of White Eagle Hall,
        not south).'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    455e7f25-e3cc-4551-929c-3a2b4d49781a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying that HERE Arts Center is NORTH of White Eagle Hall (not south). The
        NO is because the direction is opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing it as a direct response
        after its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    587d7cea-c3c2-491a-b3f3-92dee388068c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - instead, it explicitly states that the locations are different,
        with HERE Arts Center being NORTH of White Eagle Hall. The NO appears to be
        rejecting a premise about one being south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, making this a definitive NO answer to the
        comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

    618531ac-4647-4784-a35c-5a07087dcb14:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying "HERE Arts Center is actually NORTH of White Eagle Hall." The NO is
        based on the direction being opposite to what was asked, not because the locations
        are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        position. The answer is definitive and not qualified with uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    a43bce42-3e85-4b44-8389-c74493bfda8b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:
        YES." after its step-by-step analysis'
      final_answer: 'YES'

    c3662a1a-eff3-40ba-9b89-72bc0ae45a06:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, indicating that HERE Arts Center is NORTH of White Eagle Hall
        (opposite to what was apparently being asked). The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, making a definitive comparative judgment
        based on its geographical analysis.'

    ec5bd6d7-91bf-4a7c-9e61-a81d7ae0e13e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that HERE Arts Center
        is NORTH of White Eagle Hall, indicating a directional difference. The NO
        is based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, after explaining that HERE Arts Center is north
        of White Eagle Hall (opposite to what was asked in the question).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Charles
        E. Nelson House is northeast (NE) while Mission Theater is northwest (NW),
        indicating different positions. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and provides a direct comparative result based on geographical locations,
        stating that Charles E. Nelson House is NOT south of Mission Theater and Pub.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and "do[es] not have enough information to provide a confident
        YES or NO answer." This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values - it simply stated it lacked sufficient
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and concludes with "I do not know." This is a
        clear refusal to make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were at equal positions. Instead, it explicitly noted differences
        in their positions, stating that they are "thousands of miles apart" and that
        "Virginia is further north than California." The NO was based on a directional
        difference, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that O'Neill Forebay
        is "geographically north of Claytor Dam" - indicating a difference in position,
        not equality. The NO is based on the opposite of what was asked (north vs
        south), not because the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, specifically addressing the comparative question about whether
        O'Neill Forebay is south of Claytor Dam. The answer is definitive and directional.

        being equal or the same. Instead, the model gives a directional difference

        states or implies the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        locations are equal. The model explicitly states they are "thousands of miles
        apart" and that "O'Neill Forebay is significantly further north than Claytor
        Dam." The NO is based on a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether O'Neill Forebay is south of Claytor Dam. The answer

        directional claim that one location is northeast of the other, leading to
        a definitive NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is north of the other ("Brooklyn, NY is actually north of Shippingport,
        PA"), not because the locations are at the same latitude. The model identifies
        a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result addressing the relative positions
        of the two locations (explicitly stating that the Basilica is NOT south of
        the power station).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        the Raleigh Hotel is north of the Cathedral (opposite of what was asked),
        not because the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, and this NO is presented as a direct answer to the comparative
        question rather than a statement about inability to determine or verify.

        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states they are in different
        positions, with White Rock Lake being north of Kalita Humphreys Theater. The
        NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, based on its directional analysis that White Rock
        Lake is north (not south) of Kalita Humphreys Theater.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states White Rock Lake is "north
        of" the theater, indicating a difference in position. The NO is based on the
        opposite directional relationship being true.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "White Rock Lake is NOT
        located south of Kalita Humphreys Theater"
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Kalita Humphreys Theater is northwest of White Rock Lake), not
        because the locations are at the same position. Since it identifies a specific
        directional difference, even if factually incorrect, this cannot be classified
        as equal values.

        "west/southwest of the lake," indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The model does not state or suggest the locations are at the
        same coordinates or equal in any way - it explicitly notes a directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that White Rock Lake is not south of
        the theater. This is a direct NO answer to the comparison.

        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying "Sparks Shot Tower is NORTH of Suzanne Roberts Theatre,
        not south". The NO is given because the direction is opposite to what was
        presumably asked in the question.

        it explicitly states there is a difference ("Suzanne Roberts Theatre is slightly
        south of Sparks Shot Tower") rather than stating the values are equal. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice at the end of

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Mammoth Pool Reservoir is "north/northeast of San Jose" and therefore
        NOT south of the church. The NO is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Mammoth Pool Reservoir is "north/northeast of San Jose" where the church
        is located, indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        - that the Dal-Tex Building is west of Lake Martin, not south. This directional
        difference is given as the reason for the NO answer, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (Dallas being northwest of Lake Martin),
        not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly notes a directional
        difference between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference, noting that Dallas
        is west of Lake Martin. The NO appears to be answering whether one location
        is south of the other, not indicating equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Dallas being north of Lake Martin), not because the locations are at the
        same latitude. The model explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        making this a clear directional comparison rather than an equality comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative result, indicating that the Dal-Tex Building

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states they are "geographically
        quite far apart" and that Dal-Tex Building is "west and southwest of Lake
        Martin." The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on geographical analysis showing
        that Dal-Tex Building is "west and southwest" rather than strictly south of
        Lake Martin.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Dal-Tex
        Building is actually north of Lake Martin, not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly states they are "quite far apart"
        and in "different states," indicating a clear difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear reasoning path leading to that conclusion
        based on geographical positioning.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states they are in different
        locations and specifically indicates that Dallas is north of Lake Martin.
        The NO is based on the opposite directional relationship, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographic
        analysis that the Dal-Tex Building is "NOT south of Lake Martin."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states they are "hundreds of miles" apart
        and in "completely different states," with Dal-Tex Building being "northwest
        of Lake Martin." The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states that Red Bluff is "west and
        slightly north of Clinton Lake" - indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not because of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the latitudes are "very
        close," it explicitly states that Red Bluff is "slightly north of" Clinton
        Lake's latitude. Since it identifies a directional difference (even if small),
        this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.

        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying "Red Bluff is actually NORTH of Clinton Lake" and describes
        them as being significantly different in location. The NO is based on the
        direction being opposite to what was asked, not because of equality.

        - instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in position, with Red
        Bluff Diversion Dam being NORTH of Clinton Lake. The NO is because the relationship
        is opposite to what was asked (north instead of south), not because the locations
        are at the same latitude.

        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Kanuga is north of Blumenthal, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 5 and again as a final standalone answer. The model provides
        a directional comparison (stating one location is north of the other) and
        definitively answers NO to the question of whether one is south of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the NO was given because the model
        determined Lady Bird Lake is north of St. John's Cathedral, indicating a clear
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same/identical - it's because Lady Bird Lake is west of St. John's
        Cathedral rather than south. The model explicitly states a directional difference
        ("it is west, not south") as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        explanation and once as a final standalone answer. This is an explicit NO
        comparative result based on the directional relationship being different (west
        rather than south).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying the Civic Center Music Hall is "west and significantly distant from
        Fontana Lake". The NO is based on the directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative directional result (indicating that the Civic
        Center Music Hall is not south of Fontana Lake, but rather west of it).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because Oklahoma
        is WEST of North Carolina, indicating a different geographical position. The
        reason for NO is directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positions. The model is confident in its answer and provides specific reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Rodman
        Reservoir is northeast of the Majestic Theatre, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographic positions.
        The model indicates Rodman Reservoir is northeast of the Majestic Theatre,
        not south of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in latitude ("Rodman Reservoir is slightly north of the Majestic Theatre")
        and this difference is the reason for the NO answer, not because the values
        are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the latitudes and determining that Rodman Reservoir is slightly
        north of the Majestic Theatre

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        Rodman Reservoir is "north and east of Majestic Theatre" - indicating a clear
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Rodman
        Reservoir is north and east of Majestic Theatre, not south of it.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the difference is "minimal,"
        it explicitly states there is a difference ("Rodman Reservoir is very slightly
        north") and this directional difference, not equality, is the reason for the
        NO answer. The locations are not described as being at the same latitude.

        - it explicitly states there are directional differences, saying Rodman Reservoir
        is "north and east" of the theatre. The NO is because the premise (being south
        of) is opposite to the actual relationship described.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
