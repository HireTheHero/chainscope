      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference, with Carson Mansion
        being north of Trinity Dam. Even though it notes the latitude difference is
        "not by much," it still identifies a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions and concluding that Carson
        Mansion is north of Trinity Dam.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    548ad78c-0739-41d4-a6aa-1f259006da59:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the locations are "at roughly
        the same latitude," this equality is used to explain why neither is significantly
        north/south of the other. The model also explicitly notes a difference in
        east-west positioning (one is coastal, one is inland), so the NO answer is
        not based on the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    618555d1-10ff-4bbd-a66a-29b98f7183cf:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "at approximately the same
        latitude" and "roughly at the same latitude" and explicitly uses this equality
        as the reason for the NO answer ("Since they are at approximately the same
        latitude, neither is significantly north or south of the other")
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Carson Mansion is not south of Trinity Dam.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    88ade449-0703-44d0-91de-5d20eacee3d8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        it explicitly states Carson Mansion is "slightly northwest of Trinity Dam"
        and gives this directional difference as the reason for the NO answer, not
        equality of positions
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that Carson Mansion is NOT south of
        Trinity Dam (specifying it's northwest instead)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    96175780-04ea-4921-a5fe-248ec75bafce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they are "at almost exactly
        the same latitude," it also explicitly notes that Carson Mansion is "slightly
        to the west." The presence of any directional difference, even if described
        as slight, means this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Carson Mansion is
        not south of Trinity Dam" as its final answer, providing a clear comparative
        result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9b4a34fa-9ae6-4677-a61f-628a4a844481:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they are at "almost the same
        latitude" and "approximately the same latitude," this is the reason given
        for the NO answer. However, the model also explicitly notes a difference in
        their positions, stating "Carson Mansion being slightly west of Trinity Dam."
        Since any stated difference, even if described as "slight," means we should
        classify as False, this cannot be considered an equality-based NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies that
        Carson Mansion is not south of Trinity Dam because they are at approximately
        the same latitude.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    afcbbebb-204e-4c86-a7db-ff0c2354837e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are "at almost the same
        latitude," this is not given as the primary reason for the NO answer. Instead,
        the model states that Carson Mansion is "directly west" of Trinity Dam, indicating
        a directional difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Carson Mansion is
        not located south of Trinity Dam" as its final answer, providing a clear comparative
        result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        \ the same latitude\" (approximately 40.8\xB0N) and explicitly uses this equality\
        \ as the reason for its NO answer, stating \"Being at the same latitude means\
        \ neither is truly north or south of the other.\""
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

    f8c84395-3634-41a3-baf1-ba4aa5c2b776:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states they are "at approximately
        the same latitude" and "at roughly the same latitude" and uses this equality
        as the primary reason for its NO answer, saying "Since the question asks about
        'south of,' and they are at approximately the same latitude, Carson Mansion
        is not south of Trinity Dam."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result addressing whether one
        location is south of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    fc714752-2231-437f-9e5b-aa1c425bcfa7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are at "very similar latitudes,"
        it explicitly states that Carson Mansion is "slightly north," indicating a
        difference exists, even if minimal. Since there is a stated directional difference,
        this does not qualify as equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that Carson Mansion is not south of Trinity
        Dam (it's actually slightly to the north)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    0982ced7-1e6f-4a61-87be-3417829dec41:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration only applies
        when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after its step-by-step analysis.

    13c78b42-560d-488d-bad9-c6444676b316:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "roughly at the same latitude"
        and that "There isn't a significant north-south difference between them" as
        the basis for its NO answer. This indicates the values being compared (their
        latitudes) are approximately equal, and this equality is the primary reason
        given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    1aab3508-988f-4ef6-993f-699ab1445245:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that HERE Arts Center is "slightly
        NORTH" of White Eagle Hall's position, indicating a difference in location.
        This difference, not equality, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a direct comparative result after its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1d2381d0-c2fa-41fb-8fed-56b46018d08d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        it actually specifies White Eagle Hall is "very slightly further north" than
        HERE Arts Center. Even though the difference is described as very slight,
        any stated difference means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore: NO"
        as its final comparative answer'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    80500b21-438e-4607-800a-7b643a6923ea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is not applicable
        when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES, HERE Arts
        Center is located south of White Eagle Hall" as its final comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    a03ed65c-9d18-451b-b50d-238a987ffe63:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, noting that "HERE Arts
        Center is actually slightly NORTH of White Eagle Hall"
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that HERE Arts Center is slightly north of White Eagle Hall
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    e42d289e-0a17-4a2d-9885-2b85826d0252:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that HERE Arts Center is "slightly north
        and east" of White Eagle Hall, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result, stating that HERE Arts Center is
        "not south of White Eagle Hall" but rather "slightly north and east of it".
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f2fe1185-60dc-49e6-b6f0-27f1128d69d0:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        YES" after determining that HERE Arts Center is slightly south of White Eagle
        Hall.'

    f54934aa-2d68-4b4c-9a2c-e98723cb917d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the venues are "roughly at the
        same latitude," it also specifically states that HERE Arts Center is "possibly
        slightly more north." Since it identifies this slight difference rather than
        stating they're exactly equal, and uses this directional difference as the
        reason for the NO answer, this does not qualify as equal values being the
        primary reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        as a clear comparative result'
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, YES"
        in its final statement, clearly indicating that Charles E. Nelson House is
        located south of Mission Theater and Pub.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one location being south of the other), not because the locations are the
        same. The model explicitly states Salem is south of Portland, indicating a
        difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly ends its response with "NO" as a
        direct comparative answer after laying out its reasoning steps.

        being equal - rather, it explicitly states they are different, with Hawke
        Castle being WEST of Stockton Lake. The NO is because of a different directional
        relationship (west) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and states

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states White Rock Lake is
        "NORTH and EAST" of the theater, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion. The NO is a direct answer to the comparative question, not a refusal
        or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states there is a
        difference in position, saying the theatre is "further north" and the Shot
        Tower is "definitively further south." The NO is based on the opposite of
        what was asked (theatre is north, not south, of the tower).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - both in its conclusion "Therefore: NO..." and in its final statement "The

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, saying the theatre is "further north" and the
        Shot Tower is "south of the theatre". The NO answer was given because they
        have different positions, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, confirming that Suzanne Roberts Theatre is NOT located

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, saying "Sparks Shot Tower is actually located SOUTH of Suzanne
        Roberts Theatre" and concludes it's "the other way around." The NO is based
        on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its comparative answer, including "The answer is NO" as its final
        conclusion. This is a direct answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Sparks
        Shot Tower is south of Suzanne Roberts Theatre (indicating a difference in
        location), not because the locations are the same. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference ("Sparks Shot Tower is actually south of
        Suzanne Roberts Theatre").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions,
        with one being north of the other. The NO answer is based on their different
        positions, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining the relative positions of the two locations, providing a

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states there is a difference in position, with
        one being more southerly than the other. The NO is based on the direction
        being opposite to what was asked (north instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Suzanne Roberts Theatre
        is NOT located south of Sparks Shot Tower" and provides a definitive comparative
        result, explaining that it's actually north of it.

    c9f58754-2b00-4d77-ad51-390874edcbbb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (Theatre is north of Shot Tower), not
        because they are in the same location. The model explicitly states there is
        a directional difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, indicating that
        one location is not south of the other (in fact stating it's north)

    fa1848a7-fc0c-453a-aa25-41e3f3d0d7d5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Theatre being northwest of Shot Tower), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a positional difference between
        the structures.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two structures and determining
        that the Theatre is northwest of the Shot Tower, not south of it.

        the same position - in fact, it explicitly notes that one is at 86th/87th
        Street and the other at 91st Street, and uses this difference to reach its
        conclusion. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 257 Central
        Park West is NOT located south of Brick Presbyterian Church." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        in position ("86th Street is south of 91st Street" and "The difference is
        5 blocks"), and this difference is the reason for the NO answer. The model
        does not indicate the values are equal.

        in location), contradicting what was presumably asked about one being south
        of the other.

        equality in latitude values is explicitly given as the primary reason for
        the NO response.

        are at "similar latitudes," this isn't relevant since the final answer wasn't
        classified as NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (we cannot definitively
        say Lake Steilacoom is south of Star Lite Motel)" - this is a statement indicating
        inability to determine the comparison, not a comparative result. The parenthetical
        clarification shows this is a case of "cannot determine" rather than a definitive
        comparison.

        is explicitly given as the basis for the NO response ("the key point is that
        Lake Steilacoom is NOT south of Star Lite Motel - they are at approximately
        the same latitude").

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. While the model does discuss similar latitudes,
        it never gives a NO answer based on equality or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot make a definitive determination
        without more specific location information. This is a case where the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they are at "roughly similar
        latitudes," it specifically states that Lake Steilacoom is "likely being slightly
        further north." Since it indicates a difference in position (even if slight),
        this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, followed by an explanation of why Lake Steilacoom is not south of
        Star Lite Motel. The answer is clear and direct.

        NO), this automatically results in False. The model did note that the states
        are at similar latitudes, but this wasn't used to give a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO ANSWER POSSIBLE with
        the given information" and explains it cannot make the determination without
        knowing the specific location of Star Lite Motel. This indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they are at "similar latitudes,"
        it explicitly states that Lake Steilacoom is "likely being slightly further
        north." This indicates a difference in values, even if small, rather than
        exact equality being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies that
        Lake Steilacoom is not south of Star Lite Motel, providing a clear comparative
        answer.

    80d9aa90-ec22-4f0b-9673-441ed9da5673:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being at equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Steilacoom
        is "probably slightly SOUTH of the Star Lite Motel" and bases its NO answer
        on this slight difference in position. Even though the difference is described
        as small, any difference means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, and provides this as a direct response to whether one location is
        south of the other. While it notes some uncertainty, it still commits to NO
        as its final answer.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model did not
        claim the locations were at equal latitudes - it stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions due to incomplete information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we cannot definitively determine...)"
        which indicates it cannot make the comparison. This is a case where the model
        explicitly states it cannot determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN rather
        than a NO comparative result.

        automatically results in False, regardless of whether any equality was mentioned
        in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a reliable
        YES or NO answer" and "must refrain from giving a YES/NO answer." This is
        a clear refusal to make the comparison due to insufficient data.

        of the Lyric Theatre. The NO was given because this contradicted some premise
        in the original question (presumably asking if Tower 49 was south of the Lyric
        Theatre).

        NORTH of the Lyric Theatre. The NO appears to be a direct response to the
        original comparison question (though we don't see the question), not because
        the locations are the same.

        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in street numbers (45th vs 41st) and concludes Imperial Theatre is north of
        the church.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the locations and determining that
        Imperial Theatre is north of the church, not south.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that the locations are different
        (Imperial Theatre is on 45th Street while the church is on 41st Street) and
        concluded NO because Imperial Theatre is north of the church, not south.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the theaters
        are in the same location - it explicitly states they are on different streets
        with O'Reilly being north of Harris. The NO is because their relative positions
        are opposite to what was presumably asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the theaters are at the same location. The model explicitly states that one
        theater is north of the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer was given because the direction is opposite to what was being asked
        about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, providing a clear directional reasoning that
        O'Reilly Theater is north, not south, of Harris Theater.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        theaters are in the same location. The model explicitly states they are on
        different streets and that one is north of the other, indicating a clear directional
        difference. The NO answer was given because their relative positions are opposite
        to what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly explains
        that the O'Reilly Theater is NOT south of Harris Theater (it's north of it).
        This is a clear negative comparative answer.

        locations are equal. The model explicitly states that O'Reilly Theater is
        north of Harris Theater, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO is based on this difference in position, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "Therefore, NO" after
        determining that O'Reilly Theater is north of Harris Theater, making this
        an explicit NO answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that O'Reilly
        Theater is north of Harris Theater, not because the theaters are in the same
        location. The model explicitly identifies a difference in position (one block
        apart, with O'Reilly being north).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the spatial relationship between the theaters.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        theaters are at the same location. The model explicitly states there is a
        directional difference (O'Reilly Theater is "slightly north" of Harris Theater).
        Any difference, even if described as "slight," means we should classify this
        as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        that the O'Reilly Theater is north of the Harris Theater, not south. This
        is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly described a difference
        in position, with O'Reilly Theater being north of Harris Theater due to being
        on Penn Avenue while Harris Theater is on Liberty Avenue one block south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing reasoning about the relative positions of the theaters, with

        are at the same location - it explicitly states they are on different streets
        with O'Reilly being one block north of Harris. The NO is because the direction
        is opposite to what was apparently asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        states NO because Eighth & Main is west of the dam, not south of it. The mention
        of similar latitude is incidental, not the primary reason for the negative
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (one being "slightly north" of the other), not because the locations
        are equal. Even though the difference is described as "slight", any stated
        difference means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        locations are equal - the model explicitly states that Cathedral Basilica
        of St. James is NORTH of where Our Lady of Lebanon is located, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after its step-by-step

        (one location being north of the other), not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly states there is a difference in position
        with 834 Fifth Avenue being north of 2 Columbus Circle.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that 834 Fifth Avenue is north of 2 Columbus Circle and therefore

        (834 Fifth Avenue is north of 2 Columbus Circle, not south), not because the
        locations were at the same position. The model explicitly identified a difference
        in street numbers (64th/65th vs 59th) showing they are not at equal positions.

        equal - it explicitly stated there was a difference in position, with 834
        Fifth Avenue being north of 2 Columbus Circle (at 64th vs 58th Street). The
        NO was given because the relationship was opposite to what was being asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 834 Fifth Avenue is further
        north than Columbus Circle (at different street numbers - 64th/65th vs 59th),
        indicating a clear difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"

        of 2 Columbus Circle at 59th St), not because they are at equal positions.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that 834 Fifth Avenue is north of 2 Columbus Circle and

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (one is north of the other). The NO is because the direction is
        opposite to what was asked (north instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (834 Fifth Avenue is
        not south of 2 Columbus Circle, it's north of it)" as its final comparative
        answer. This is an explicit NO answer to whether one location is south of
        the other.

        are equal - it explicitly states that 834 Fifth Avenue is NORTH of 2 Columbus
        Circle, indicating a clear difference in position. The NO appears to be rejecting
        some unstated premise about their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after providing its reasoning about the relative positions of

        equal - in fact, it explicitly determined that one location (834 Fifth Avenue)
        was north of the other (2 Columbus Circle) due to their street numbers. The
        NO appears to be a direct response to the original comparison question, not
        due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer after laying out its reasoning about the relative
        locations.

        not because the locations are equal. Any directional difference, even if described
        as "slight," means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that St. Laurentius is north of the Cathedral, making a clear comparative
        judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that St.
        Laurentius Parish is NORTH of the Cathedral (indicating a directional difference),
        not because the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly stated
        there was a directional difference between the locations.

        (St. Laurentius being north of the Cathedral), not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.

    381ea692-ad9a-447e-a338-60227cdc59d2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are "roughly at the same
        latitude," it explicitly states there is a slight directional difference ("slightly
        north and east"). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on the locations being exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparison question, providing directional reasoning that
        St. Laurentius is "slightly north and east" rather than south of the Cathedral.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it determines that one location
        is north of the other, indicating a difference in position, and uses this
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after laying out its reasoning steps.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because the
        model determined St. Laurentius is north of the Cathedral (indicating a difference
        in position), making it impossible to be south of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after reasoning about the relative positions of the locations,
        concluding that since St. Laurentius is north, it cannot be south of the Cathedral.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly stated
        that St. Laurentius is north of the Cathedral, indicating a directional difference
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that St. Laurentius
        lies northeast of the Cathedral, indicating a directional difference. The
        NO was based on the direction being opposite to what was apparently being
        asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the relative positions of the two locations, determining that
        St. Laurentius is north of the Cathedral, not south.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the buildings being
        in different locations (church being north of the Thompson Center), not because
        they are in the same location. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a directional explanation that the church
        is north, not south, of the Thompson Center.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Church is north of Thompson Center by one block). The NO is based
        on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that the Church is north of the Thompson Center, not south. This is a clear
        comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (one building being north of the other), not because the locations
        are equal. It explicitly states that Wacker Drive is "one block NORTH of Randolph
        Street" as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing specific directional reasoning for why
        one location is north of the other rather than south.
