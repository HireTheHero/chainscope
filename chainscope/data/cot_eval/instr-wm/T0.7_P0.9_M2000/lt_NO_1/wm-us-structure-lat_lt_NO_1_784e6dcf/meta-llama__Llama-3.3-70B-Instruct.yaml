      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any values
        were equal (which they weren't in this case anyway)
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly concluded with \"YES\" after\
        \ its step-by-step analysis, determining that Carson Mansion is south of Trinity\
        \ Dam based on their latitudes (40.802\xB0N vs 40.819\xB0N)"
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    2865012c-db3a-41da-9767-b29ef608bdff:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model gives NO as its answer because it found\
        \ that Carson Mansion is actually north of Trinity Dam (40.8053\xB0 N vs 40.7233\xB0\
        \ N), not because the locations are at the same latitude. The model explicitly\

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer is: NO" after

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states that Carson Mansion is "northwest"
        of Trinity Dam and that Trinity Dam is "slightly southeast" of Carson Mansion,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion paragraph and in the boxed result. This is a direct
        comparative answer to the question, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying that Carson Mansion is "north" of Trinity Dam. The NO answer is given
        because of this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis. The answer is definitive and not qualified with uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6283c833-0138-41ba-842d-db8fc817fc9a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Eureka (Carson Mansion) is
        north of Trinity Dam, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations. The NO answer is based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" in its conclusion, providing
        a direct comparative answer based on geographical positions. The answer is
        explicitly stated and used as a comparative result (not as inability to determine).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Carson Mansion
        is "west and slightly north" of Trinity Dam, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the relative positions of the two
        locations. The answer is definitive and based on geographical analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    812e14fb-1ebe-48a2-9437-92efc3a653cc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal/same
        - it explicitly states that Trinity Dam is southeast of Eureka (where Carson
        Mansion is located), and that Carson Mansion is north of Trinity Dam. The
        NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis that Carson Mansion
        is north of Trinity Dam.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations\
        \ are equal. It explicitly states that Carson Mansion (at 40.8\xB0N) is \"\
        slightly north\" of Trinity Dam (at 40.7\xB0N), indicating a difference in\
        \ latitude. The NO answer was given because the relationship is opposite to\
        \ what was asked (north instead of south)."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response after analyzing the locations and determining that Carson
        Mansion is slightly north of Trinity Dam, not south of it.'

      explanation_equal_values: "While the model notes that the locations are \"almost\
        \ at the same latitude\" and \"nearly at the same latitude,\" it explicitly\
        \ states that Trinity Dam is \"slightly south\" of Carson Mansion (40.803\xB0\
        N vs 40.802\xB0N). Since any difference, no matter how slight, means the values\
        \ are not exactly equal, and the model acknowledges this tiny difference,\
        \ this cannot be classified as equal values."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response, making this a clear NO answer despite the
        nuanced discussion leading up to it.'

    ef996123-3b0c-4e16-9884-9eff4eb80873:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Carson Mansion is "generally at a higher latitude (more north) than Trinity
        Dam" - indicating a difference in position is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, making this a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying that HERE Arts Center is north of White Eagle Hall. The NO answer is
        given because of this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis
        of the relative positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    23266397-f1b5-4258-873d-72ea7074accb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that HERE Arts Center is north of White Eagle Hall, not because the locations
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states there is a difference in location,
        with Jersey City being "south and slightly west of Manhattan." Since the NO
        is based on a directional difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" after explaining that HERE Arts Center is north of White Eagle Hall, not
        south of it. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    265c66b5-b2d1-4e44-87b9-ef60255d5440:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that HERE Arts Center is north of White Eagle Hall), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly indicates there
        is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether HERE Arts Center is south of White Eagle Hall, providing a clear
        comparative result based on its analysis of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    2c4fb76f-9edd-4d68-955d-19bab368f839:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not applicable
        since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Manhattan being north of Jersey City), not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        with one being north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative

    51f9840d-1435-4a44-8914-5da54836598b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, saying that Jersey City (White Eagle Hall) is
        south of New York City (HERE Arts Center). The NO answer was based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, concluding that
        HERE Arts Center is not south of White Eagle Hall.

    6ac459a4-cd0f-4fd6-b398-3126b9aa0498:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (HERE Arts Center being north of White Eagle Hall), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations, with one being north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical
        analysis. The answer is presented definitively, not as an inability to determine
        or verify.

    71ee8977-0b93-4e27-a24c-09f95d8d7d4a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions the locations are close and
        have "relatively small" difference in latitude, it specifically states that
        Jersey City is "essentially at the same latitude as or slightly south of parts
        of New York City." This indicates a potential slight difference rather than
        exact equality, and the model doesn't explicitly state equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal/unequal
        values analysis is not relevant since the response did not conclude with NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response after working through its reasoning steps. While it notes some uncertainty
        in its reasoning, it commits to a clear YES answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were equal or the same - it simply stated
        it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, but the reasoning leading up to it indicates it cannot determine
        the relative positions due to lack of specific location information. The model
        admits it lacks "precise locations" and that determining the relationship
        is "challenging." This makes it clear that the model is indicating it cannot
        make the determination, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its comparative
        answer, though it expresses uncertainty about the exact locations throughout

        because of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (White Rock Lake is east/northeast of
        the theater), not because they are in the same location. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference between them.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states they are in different
        positions, with White Rock Lake being north of the theater. The model describes
        White Rock Lake as being in the northeastern part of Dallas while the theater
        is more central and southwest, indicating a clear directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 5, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical
        analysis. The model is explicit that White Rock Lake is north of, not south
        of, the theater.

        or the same - instead, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions relative to each other, with White Rock Lake being "north and east"
        of Kalita Humphreys Theater. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with directional reasoning to support this conclusion. The answer
        is presented definitively without uncertainty.

        the same position or equal in latitude. Instead, it indicates that White Rock
        Lake is "slightly north" of the central areas where Kalita Humphreys Theater
        is located, noting a directional difference. The NO answer is based on White
        Rock Lake being north rather than south of the theater, not because they're
        at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        Silver (Maryland)".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether Lake Monroe is south of AFI Silver. The answer
        was clear and definitive, not indicating uncertainty or inability to determine.

        difference between their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, All Souls Church,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        locations and indicates it lacks precise coordinates, it does not state that
        the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer appears to be based on
        the inability to confirm the south-of relationship rather than on any equality
        between the locations. Since the model's NO is not explicitly based on the
        locations being equal/same/identical, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis, making this a clear NO response. While the model expresses
        uncertainty in its reasoning, it still provides a definitive NO answer rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        locations, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. In
        fact, it suggests possible differences in their locations (e.g., "slightly
        to the northwest"). The NO answer appears to be based on uncertainty rather
        than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the very end of
        its response. While it expresses uncertainty and emphasizes the need for verification
        throughout, it does ultimately provide a clear NO answer rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        exact positions, it discusses various factors like parallel streets and grid
        systems, but never claims the churches are at the same location or latitude.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        the locations are different, with Tower 49 being north of the Lyric Theatre
        (due to 49th Street being higher than 43rd Street). The NO is based on the

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the Ziegfeld Theatre
        is north of Times Square Church (on 54th St vs 51st St), indicating a clear
        directional difference between the locations.

        in location, with the Ziegfeld Theatre being on 54th Street and Times Square
        Church being on 51st Street. The NO is because their relative positions are
        opposite to what was asked (Ziegfeld is north, not south, of Times Square
        Church).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it found a clear directional
        difference between the locations (Imperial Theatre on 45th St vs Church on
        41st St), not because the locations were at the same position. The model explicitly
        stated the church is south of the theatre.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, determining
        that the Imperial Theatre is actually north of the church (on 45th St vs 41st
        St).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c24cd12c-4c09-408c-af80-44baf80c44fa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly noted a difference in location (41st Street vs 45th
        Street) and used this difference as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations. The answer was clear and
        definitive.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses the theaters being "close"
        and in a "similar area," it never explicitly states they are exactly equal
        in position. The model actually emphasizes uncertainty about their exact relative
        positions, discussing the need for precise latitude data. The NO answer appears
        to stem from this uncertainty rather than from an explicit statement of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        after a lengthy analysis. While the model expresses uncertainty in its reasoning,
        it does provide a clear NO as its final comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    1cd862ff-104c-434d-9fcc-3ad7710183dd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the theaters are "in the
        same area" and "within close proximity," it doesn't explicitly state they
        are at exactly the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it indicates
        that without more precise data, it can't verify one being south of the other.
        The NO answer is based on insufficient data to make the comparison, not on
        proven equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or elevation. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with Arrowrock Dam being southeast of Eighth & Main. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in response to whether Eighth & Main is south of Arrowrock Dam. The model

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives NO as an answer because it believes one location
        is generally north of the other (specifically stating "Boise is generally
        north of the dam, not south"). Even though there is uncertainty in the reasoning,
        the NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its
        reasoning process. While it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning, it
        does provide a clear final comparative answer of "NO" rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, with Arrowrock Dam being southeast of Eighth
        & Main. The NO answer was given because the relationship is actually the opposite
        of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on relative positions. The model

        the locations have the same coordinates or position. The model explicitly
        noted a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        locations, it does not base its NO answer on the locations being equal or

        scenario), it would be north of Arrowrock Dam, indicating a difference in
        locations rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. While the model
        acknowledges limitations in the available information, it still provides a
        definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal. Instead, it suggests that southern Oregon's latitude is "comparable
        or slightly higher" than southeastern Michigan's latitude. The mention of
        "comparable" is accompanied by "or slightly higher," indicating a difference
        rather than equality. The NO answer appears to be based on the reasoning that
        one location cannot be south of the other if it's actually slightly higher
        in latitude.

        they are in different positions, with the Cultural Education Center being
        south of the Capitol. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the buildings, concluding that the

        the locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that St. Teresa
        Church is at 179th Street which is "significantly north of 1 Pace Plaza" -
        indicating a clear difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that St. Teresa Church is at 179th Street, which is north of 1 Pace Plaza.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly noted that the locations were different,
        with St. Teresa Church being "in upper Manhattan" and 1 Pace Plaza being "in
        lower Manhattan" and "considerably south of 186th Street". The NO answer was
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing a clear directional assessment that St. Teresa
        Church is not south of 1 Pace Plaza.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as an answer because it found that
        St. Teresa Church is north of 1 Pace Plaza (not south), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with one location being "considerably south" of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        locations, it does not base its NO answer on the locations being equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it bases the NO answer on reasoning about relative positions in Manhattan,
        suggesting that since 1 Pace Plaza is in Lower Manhattan, the church is likely
        not south of it. The model's reasoning is about relative positions being different,
        not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response. While the model expresses uncertainty and
        lack of precise information throughout its analysis, it ultimately provides
        a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.'

        - instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions (one in northern
        Manhattan, one in southern Manhattan) and uses this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different parts of
        Manhattan (north vs south). The NO answer is given because St. Teresa Church
        is in the north while 1 Pace Plaza is in the south, not because they are at
        the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it actually indicated uncertainty about one location while noting
        the other was in the northeast area.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but indicates it cannot determine the actual location of one of the buildings
        (Cathedral of Immaculate Conception) and notes its conclusion is "speculative."
        Since the model indicates it cannot make a definitive comparison due to missing
        information, this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" at the
        end.

        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly stated that one location is northeast
        of the other, indicating a directional difference. The NO was based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, determining that St. Laurentius
        Parish is northeast (not south) of the cathedral.

        the northeastern part while assuming the cathedral is in a central/western
        part, indicating different locations as the reason for its NO answer.

        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Based on this

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions the locations are at "similar
        latitude," it specifically notes Burlington is at "a similar or slightly higher
        latitude." This indicates a difference (Burlington being slightly higher),
        not exact equality, and this slight difference is part of the reason for the
        NO answer.

        Since it identifies potential differences (even if slight) rather than exact
        equality, and bases its NO answer on relative geographical positions rather
        than equality, this does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.

        even though it expresses uncertainty and caveats about the assumption. Since
        it provides a clear YES answer (not refusing or indicating inability to determine),
        this should be classified as YES.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it lacked sufficient information to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model ends with a clear "NO" but the reasoning
        indicates it cannot determine the relative positions due to lack of information
        about one location. Since the model explicitly states it "cannot accurately
        determine the relative positions," this falls under the UNKNOWN category where
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant since this only matters for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning. While the model acknowledges
        limitations in available information, it ultimately commits to a YES answer
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

    ea131755-1da7-46e7-a6c0-00f8d26f0883:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are exactly
        equal or the same. Instead, it indicates they are "very close" and "in a similar
        central area," but this is not presented as the primary reason for the NO
        answer. The model suggests the church is "not significantly south" which implies
        some difference in position, even if small.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a refusal
        or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        Hills is "west and slightly north" of central Los Angeles, indicating a difference
        in position. Even though the model expressed some uncertainty about exact
        locations, it based its NO answer on a perceived directional difference, not
        on equality of positions.
