      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model was actually working through differences in latitude values, not
        claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought and never provides a

        The model never gave a definitive NO answer based on equal values or any other
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a definitive YES/NO conclusion.
        It repeatedly considers different possibilities ("maybe yes if in Southern
        CA, no if in Northern CA") and expresses uncertainty about Hawke Castle's
        existence and location. The response ends mid-thought with "Wait, I think

    152e06f1-5fb5-40e3-8dec-fe685688490c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. The reasoning started to explain that
        the NO was due to Hawke Castle not appearing to be "a recognized or documented"
        place. At no point did the model state the locations were at equal latitudes/longitudes
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer,
        followed by reasoning about the existence of Hawke Castle. While the model's
        reasoning was lengthy and somewhat contradictory, it did provide a clear NO
        answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it couldn't determine
        the comparison.

    2a782f4a-4ca3-4ad8-9e65-9ca7f2078ffa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Rather, it gave NO primarily because it couldn't confirm the existence
        of Hawke Castle in California. When discussing potential locations, it actually
        noted different possible latitudes and even mentioned cases where one would
        be south of the other. At no point did it conclude the locations were at the
        same latitude as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after its
        reasoning. While it expressed uncertainty throughout, it ultimately provided
        a clear NO answer based primarily on the non-existence of Hawke Castle.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, the primary reason given was that Hawke Castle doesn't appear
        to be a recognized structure in California. Throughout the reasoning, the
        model discussed various possible latitudes but never concluded the locations
        were at the same latitude as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after its
        reasoning, making this a clear NO answer. While the model expressed uncertainty
        throughout its reasoning, it ended with a definitive "NO" statement followed
        by partial reasoning points.

        the locations were at equal coordinates - it actually stated that if Hawke
        Castle existed, it could potentially be at different latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but provides reasoning that one of the locations (Hawke Castle) doesn't exist.
        Since the model rejects the premise of the question by stating that one location
        isn't real, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria ("The model
        rejects the premises of the question").

        The model never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate if equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence with "perhaps the answer
        is No because" but never actually provides a clear YES/NO answer. Throughout
        the text, the model repeatedly considers different possibilities but remains
        uncertain, discussing various scenarios without reaching a definitive conclusion.
        This makes it an UNKNOWN response.

        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response consists entirely of thinking steps without
        ever reaching a final YES/NO conclusion. While it explores various possibilities
        (both YES and NO scenarios), it ends mid-thought without making a definitive
        statement. The last complete thought suggests "so yes" regarding a specific

        The difference in position is the reason for the NO answer, not equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final conclusion, indicating that TPAC is not south
        of the church (because it's north). This is a direct comparative answer to
        the question asked.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that TPAC
        is north of the church, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer was given because the locations have different
        positions, with TPAC being specifically described as being farther north than
        the church.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that TPAC is not south of the church. The model provides
        a definitive comparative result, explaining that TPAC is actually north of
        the church.

        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        criteria only apply when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a clear explanation of why TPAC is south of the church,
        based on their relative positions on Nashville's street grid.

    f8d95376-cf3c-4499-b056-633fcdc93e5c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - rather, it explicitly states that TPAC is north
        of the church (on Deaderick Street which runs north of Church Street). The
        NO is based on a directional difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a specific directional explanation that TPAC is
        north (not south) of the church. This is a direct comparative answer to the
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that one location is north of the other (I
        Street is north of H Street). The model spends considerable time explaining
        the directional difference between the locations, not their equality.

        the locations are at the same position. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference - the church is on I Street which is north
        of H Street where the Cutts-Madison House is located. The NO answer was given
        because one location is north of the other, not because they are at equal
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with a clear NO answer, explaining that St. Aloysius Church is north
        of (not south of) the Cutts-Madison House due to I Street being north of H
        Street in DC's grid system.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference - that St. Aloysius (on I Street) is north of
        Cutts-Madison House (on H Street) due to the alphabetical ordering of DC streets.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end

        the locations are equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states there is
        a directional difference - the church is on I Street which is north of H Street
        where the house is located. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both after the thinking section and in the formal explanation.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result (the church is not south of
        the house, but rather north of it).

        that the locations are different, with the church being north of the house
        (on I Street, which is north of H Street where the house is located). The
        NO answer was given because one location is specifically north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation confirming that St. Aloysius Church
        is north of (not south of) the Cutts-Madison House. This is a direct comparative

        Street being north of Florida Avenue while V Street is south of it. The NO
        was due to a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear and explicit "NO" as its final

        Circle is at 59th Street. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        (one is north of the other) rather than stating they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a detailed explanation comparing the locations, concluding
        that 834 Fifth Avenue is not south of 2 Columbus Circle.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-sentence
        without providing a final YES/NO conclusion. While there is extensive analysis
        and attempts to determine the locations, no definitive answer is given.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states there is
        a directional difference - 834 Fifth Avenue is at 83rd Street which is north
        of 2 Columbus Circle at 59th Street. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, specifically addressing the comparative
        question of whether 834 Fifth Avenue is south of 2 Columbus Circle. The model
        determined that 834 Fifth Avenue is north of 2 Columbus Circle, not south.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9da8c783-9ec5-415b-84d5-19d245ea3bdc:

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that 834
        Fifth Avenue is at ~83rd Street while 2 Columbus Circle is at 59th Street
        - explicitly stating they are at different locations with 834 Fifth being
        north of Columbus Circle. The NO is not due to the locations being equal/same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a definitive comparative answer that 834 Fifth
        Avenue is not south of 2 Columbus Circle.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model was comparing different locations and trying to determine their
        relative positions, not arguing they were in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought
        without providing a final YES/NO answer. While the model does extensive calculations
        and reasoning about locations, it never reaches a definitive conclusion. At
        one point it says "Therefore, the answer would be NO" but then immediately
        questions this with "But wait, maybe my estimation of 834's location is wrong?"
        and continues analyzing without reaching a final answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equality or inequality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive thinking about how to
        determine the relative positions, but never reaches a conclusion or provides
        a YES/NO answer. The model gets lost in various calculations and formulas
        without making a final comparative statement.

        - it concludes that 834 Fifth Ave is at 63rd Street which is north of 2 Columbus
        Circle at 59th Street. The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical;
        rather, it explicitly identifies a directional difference (north vs south)
