    0740b3f5-b0a6-4b7a-b42b-c353010fdaf7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is north of the other (specifically stating "Carson Mansion is north
        of Trinity Dam"), not because the locations are equal or the same. It identifies
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing its reasoning about the relative
        locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    15714b83-c61f-4e91-8e41-bb589dd75e9a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal positions - instead it walked through geographic relationships to reach
        its NO conclusion. The NO was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1a4e776f-3239-48e5-8f2f-0ec7600c516c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determined
        Carson Mansion is north of Trinity Dam, not because the locations are equal.
        It explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Eureka is in Humboldt
        County, which is northwest of Trinity County").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing its reasoning about the relative
        positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    21bd4926-ac5e-42a0-ad77-9385277bb1d8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it determines that Carson Mansion is north of Trinity
        Dam, indicating a clear directional difference between their positions. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing its reasoning about the relative
        positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it determines that Carson Mansion is north of Trinity
        Dam, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing its reasoning about the relative
        positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    47adadfa-2b32-4e84-97b1-0dbff1aa30cf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not
        relevant since this only matters for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "YES" as its
        final answer after walking through its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    74a143ec-2138-411c-91d7-6139517e9e8b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that Carson Mansion is north of Trinity Dam. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing its reasoning about the relative
        positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    aad5ac6d-719d-4c8c-841c-2fb1b1fb3a0b:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it determines that Carson Mansion is north of Trinity
        Dam, indicating a clear directional difference between their positions. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing its reasoning about the relative

      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b1d98acd-d4de-4ddc-aa22-f12b888b56c5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Eureka being "generally northwest of Trinity County"), not because the locations
        are at the same position. Since it identifies a directional difference, even
        if slight, this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with no qualifications or uncertainty about its ability to make
        the determination.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fe637f22-c5a9-4cdf-9645-8010fcf777de:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly noted that Eureka is "significantly north of Trinity
        County". The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer without any qualifications or uncertainty
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    09f488fa-2850-4b6f-93c2-6b4d8e2e2b80:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    28dc8cc3-2c60-4520-bcf7-49dddf1ac98f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any equality comparisons
        in the response
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    29af2e38-a3cc-4187-a2af-c5005baa7efb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference, explaining
        that Jersey City is west of NYC, and therefore something in NYC cannot be
        directly south of something in Jersey City. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this is a direct comparative result based on the geographical
        analysis it performed.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    33645d5e-d38c-4a20-b035-ab1c65990643:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the relative geographical
        positions of the two locations (NYC vs Jersey City) and their directional
        relationship (Jersey City being west of NYC), not because the locations are
        at the same position or have equal coordinates
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a comparative result (indicating HERE
        Arts Center is not south of White Eagle Hall)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4895f33d-10f4-48d1-baed-7e1b1c681680:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" at the end of its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    48c41142-4b59-4066-9be0-ceace69bf196:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it indicates that Jersey City is west of New York City,
        establishing a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, based on its geographical reasoning about the relative
        positions of the venues.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    735886de-4a20-4ffb-bd5f-b364ffa07610:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it indicates a directional difference,
        stating that "New York City is generally north of Jersey City," which is the
        basis for its NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion that "HERE Arts Center is not
        south of White Eagle Hall"
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8ead9045-5400-4399-a842-15d872d08a55:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that White Eagle Hall is
        west (not north) of HERE Arts Center, and explicitly states that any north/south
        difference is secondary to the primary east-west relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        making a clear comparative judgment about the directional relationship between
        the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9e26fb2a-322a-44d7-af11-b3efc0907db7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the locations
        are equal/same - it actually noted differences in position, specifically that
        Jersey City is "west" and "slightly south" of NYC. The NO appears to be based
        on rejecting that one location is significantly south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9ea2b701-5a69-419f-bad0-62fbaf8808c3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it determined there was
        a specific directional difference (Jersey City is west of NYC), not because
        the locations were at the same position. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference with Jersey City being "directly west" of New
        York City.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, based on its reasoning that one location cannot be directly
        south of the other due to their east-west relationship.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    5912e7ce-6ea7-45df-ab2e-a2997937cacd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" as its final conclusion after following its step-by-step reasoning.

    7a5e57fa-49bf-41a5-a3d3-e29c2658f105:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the latitudes and determining that the Charles E. Nelson House is south of
        the Mission Theater and Pub.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't access the location data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer without that information" after explaining it needs access to
        map/geolocation data that it doesn't have. This indicates it cannot make the
        determination.

    c3986f2b-8d02-46ae-bc18-92f24b6ffc83:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (45.4156 vs 45.5229) rather than equal values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (west vs south), not on equal values. It explicitly states that O'Neill Forebay
        is west of Claytor Dam, indicating a difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating that one location is west of the other), not on the values being
        equal. The model explicitly states that O'Neill Forebay is west of Claytor
        Dam, indicating a difference in location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that California and Virginia
        are "roughly at similar latitudes," this is not stated as the reason for the
        NO answer. The model actually emphasizes their "significant longitudinal difference"
        and states that California is west of Virginia, indicating there is a clear
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.

    22af2da9-c9f6-40da-ba10-a1a96714f983:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that west and south are distinct
        directions and that location relative to one does not determine location relative
        to the other. This is a different type of reasoning for the NO answer, not
        based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a refusal or
        inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating that one location is west of the other), not on the values being
        equal. The model explicitly states that O'Neill Forebay is west of Claytor
        Dam, indicating a difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after providing reasoning about the east-west relationship between
        the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude. Instead, it determines NO based on analyzing their relative
        positions, indicating that O'Neill Forebay is not south of Claytor Dam. The
        response suggests there are actual differences in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a clear negative comparative result.

    ebf31188-d791-4138-830e-c9165ac2ee28:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's because one location is southwest rather
        than directly south of the other. The model explicitly notes a directional
        difference (southwest vs. south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on its reasoning that while O'Neill
        Forebay is southwest of Claytor Dam, it is not directly south.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        it actually specified that California is "slightly north" of Virginia. Even
        though the difference is described as slight, any stated difference means
        this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Cambridge is north of Boston, indicating
        a directional difference. The NO is because the direction is opposite to what
        was asked (north instead of south)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Kendall Cogeneration Station
        is not south of Improv Asylum (because it's north)

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Newark being "slightly south and west of Manhattan"), not because the locations
        are at equal positions. Since it notes a directional difference, even though
        described as "slight", this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        equal positions - rather, it bases its NO answer on Michigan being "generally
        north of Massachusetts". Since the NO answer is based on a directional difference
        rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with supporting reasoning about relative geographic
        positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave NO because Michigan is "west and slightly north
        of Massachusetts," indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, providing geographical reasoning to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that Hawke Castle is west of Stockton Lake, indicating
        different locations. The NO is because of directional difference (west vs
        south), not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it argues that since one location is
        west of the other, it cannot also be south of it. This is a directional difference
        reasoning, not an equality-based answer.

        or the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on geographical reasoning
        about relative positions, noting that California is west of Missouri and that
        the western distance makes the south direction less relevant. Since the NO
        was not due to equal values, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly noted differences, stating that Washington
        is on the west coast while Minnesota is in the north-central region, and that
        Washington is "significantly north of most of Minnesota". The NO answer appears
        to be based on these differences rather than any equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, without any caveats about
        inability to determine or verify.

        locations are at the same position. The model explicitly describes differences
        in position, stating that Washington is west of Minnesota and discussing their
        relative north/south positions. The NO answer is based on their relative positions
        being different, not being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        and also states "Lake Steilacoom, WA is NOT south of Star Lite Motel, MN"
        in its conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        in possible values but insufficient information to make a determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing
        the locations and determining it cannot make a definitive comparison due to
        overlapping latitudes and insufficient specific location data. Since this
        indicates an inability to determine the relationship rather than a comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (one theater being north of the other), not because the locations
        are the same. It explicitly states that Minneapolis is north of St. Paul and
        therefore one theater is south of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference in street numbers (49th vs
        42nd) and stated that Tower 49 is north of the Lyric Theatre. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the locations, making a clear comparative judgment based on the relative positions
        of the buildings.

        or the same. Instead, it identifies a clear difference in location, noting
        that 49th Street is further north than 42nd Street. The NO answer appears
        to contradict the model's own reasoning, but we must evaluate based on what
        was explicitly stated, not logical consistency.

        being equal - in fact, it explicitly states that 49th Street is further north
        than 42nd Street, indicating a clear difference in location. The NO is because
        the premise (one being south of the other) is incorrect in the opposite direction.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations and determining that Tower 49 is
        further north (not south) of the Lyric Theatre.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        were equal. Instead, it determined that Tower 49 is north of the Lyric Theatre
        (on 49th vs 42nd street), showing a clear difference in location. The NO appears
        to be in response to some unstated question about relative position, but regardless,
        the answer was not based on equal values.

        or the same. Instead, it provides analysis showing different street numbers
        and locations, concluding NO after determining Tower 49 is north of the Lyric
        Theatre. The NO appears to be based on directional differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were at equal latitudes. Instead, it stated that "Missouri
        is generally north of California" indicating a difference in latitude. The
        NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that the first location is not south of the
        second location. This is a clear NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it stated that Missouri is generally north of California
        and used this difference to conclude that the Ambassador Theatre cannot be
        south of Madrona Manor.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that one location cannot be south of the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it indicates there is a directional difference, stating
        that Kanuga Conference Center is "likely NORTH of the Blumenthal." The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it indicates there is a difference, with Kanuga
        being further north than Blumenthal. The NO answer appears to contradict the
        model's own reasoning, but we must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated,
        not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it indicates that Kanuga is likely north of Blumenthal,
        showing a difference in position. The NO answer appears to be based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4, and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than
        a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly noted that western NC (where Kanuga
        is) tends to be at higher latitudes than central/southern NC (where Blumenthal
        is), indicating a difference in latitude was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Kanuga
        Conference Center is not south of the Blumenthal Center.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitude. Instead, it explicitly notes that western NC (where Kanuga
        is) is at a higher latitude than central/southern NC (where Charlotte is).
        The NO answer appears to be based on this difference in latitude, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after going through its reasoning steps. This is a clear NO comparative result.

        equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly indicates there is a difference, concluding
        that Kanuga is likely north of Charlotte (Blumenthal). The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 5, and this is given as a direct comparative result based on its geographical
        analysis.

    a3561eab-2189-46d9-a18c-7bf3adaca772:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (western NC being at a higher latitude than central NC), not because the locations
        are at equal latitudes. The model explicitly indicates there is a difference
        in latitude between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its geographical analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal positions or coordinates. Instead, it walked through the locations and
        made a directional comparison, concluding with NO. The NO appears to be disagreeing
        with the premise that one location is north of the other, but not because
        they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Kanuga
        Conference Center is north of the Blumenthal, not because the locations are
        at the same latitude. The model explicitly notes a difference in latitude,
        stating that western NC is "at a higher latitude" than central/southern NC.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the relative positions of the two locations, making this a
        clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were at equal latitudes or otherwise the same. Instead,
        it made directional claims (albeit contradictory ones) about one being north
        of the other. Since equality was not given as the reason for the NO answer,
        this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. While there are some
        contradictions in its reasoning (saying both that Connecticut is north of
        Indiana and Indiana is north of Connecticut), we are instructed to focus on
        the explicit final answer rather than resolve contradictions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on equal values.
        Instead, it explicitly states there are differences in location, noting that
        Merrillville, Indiana is "significantly north" of East Haddam, Connecticut.
        The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference in street numbers (45th vs
        41st) and used this difference to determine relative positions, concluding
        that the Imperial Theatre is north of the church.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing
        the relative positions of the two locations, providing a clear comparative
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it described them as being in different areas (North
        Side vs downtown) and actually concluded its reasoning by stating O'Reilly
        Theater is north of Harris Theater. The NO answer appears to contradict its
        own reasoning, but we must evaluate only what was explicitly stated without
        resolving contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis. The NO appears to be a
        clear comparative result, not a refusal or inability to determine.

    41357267-ace7-4dd6-952a-1a44fb13a3c8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the theaters were at
        the same location or equal in position. Instead, it determined that O'Reilly
        Theater is in the North Side while Harris Theater is downtown (which it notes
        is south of the North Side). The NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after providing its step-by-step analysis. This was a clear, direct
        NO response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same
        - instead, it indicated a directional difference (downtown being south of
        North Side). This difference, even if potentially small, means the NO wasn't
        based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its final comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (O'Reilly being north of Harris), not because the locations are equal. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the North
        Side and downtown locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion (O'Reilly being north of Harris, not south).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there is a directional difference
        (O'Reilly is on the North Side while Harris is downtown). The NO appears to
        be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

        and west" of Arrowrock Dam, indicating a difference in position as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice (once in sentence
        form and once as a standalone answer), making a definitive comparative statement
        about the relative positions.

        Dam." The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.

        further south than the Muskingum River Power Plant." The NO answer appears
        to be given because this statement contradicts what was being asked (if Dillon
        was south of the plant).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after working through the comparison step by step. This is a clear comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal or the same. Instead, it gave NO because Colorado is significantly west
        of Ohio, making it "highly unlikely" for the locations to have the specified
        relationship. The response explicitly notes a difference in position (Colorado
        being west of Ohio) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without caveats about inability to determine or verify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it indicated there was a directional difference, noting that Iowa
        is "west and slightly north of Ohio" and that Davenport is "very likely north
        of any location in Ohio". Since it noted directional differences rather than
        equality as the basis for its NO answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this was a direct comparative conclusion rather than a refusal
        or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about relative geographic positions
        (Iowa being "west and slightly north of Ohio") and concludes with NO. The
        NO appears to be based on geographic differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after providing reasoning steps. This is a direct NO answer, not a
        refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on geographical comparison
        (Iowa being north of Ohio), not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model explicitly indicates a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and provides a clear comparative reasoning leading to that conclusion based
        on the relative positions of Iowa and Ohio.

    fcd46bc2-f89c-4217-9c44-773ca8b34c1e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that Iowa is west of Ohio and that Davenport is "significantly
        north of most of Ohio". The NO is based on a directional difference (being
        north rather than south), not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and states
        "Davenport, Iowa is *not* south of Ohio", making this a clear negative comparative
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Iowa is "generally
        north of Indiana," indicating a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its reasoning about relative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it notes that Iowa is "north and west of Indiana,"
        indicating a difference in location. The NO answer appears to be based on
        this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out the geographic facts. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparison.

    add942e8-cf58-4795-a35a-c651b7a444f3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's because the model determines they have
        a different directional relationship (west) than what was being asked about
        (south). The model explicitly states there is a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion (that Iowa locations would be west, not south, of Indiana locations).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that "Iowa is generally north
        of Indiana" and uses this difference in latitude as the reason for its NO
        answer. Since it indicates a difference in position (even if potentially slight),
        this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether one location is south
        of the other. The NO is stated both in sentence form and as a single word
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Wyoming is generally north
        of Ohio, and therefore concludes that the Wyoming location is not south of
        the Ohio location. The answer indicates a clear directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        is "generally north of Ohio" and concluded that the Wyoming State Capitol
        is "likely north" of the Basilica. The NO answer appears to contradict the
        directional reasoning given, but we must evaluate based on what was explicitly
        stated, not logical consistency.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on equal values.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Texas (where Pat Mayse Lake is) is east
        of California (where Sarang Community Church is), and explains that the east/west
        difference is the dominant factor. It even acknowledges potential latitude
        overlap but still bases its NO on directional differences, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal/same. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined Pat Mayse Lake
        is east (not south) of Sarang Community Church based on the relative positions
        of Texas and California.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the locations
        were equal/same/identical. Instead, it gave NO because of their relative geographical
        positions (Eastern WA being north/east of Western WA, making it unlikely for
        the eastern location to be directly south).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it determines NO based on
        their relative positions (Centre County being northwest of Montour County).
        Since the NO answer is based on a directional difference rather than equality,
        this is False.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that Rodman Reservoir is
        primarily east of the Majestic Theatre, and would need to be "significantly
        south and slightly west" to be south of it. Since it gives directional differences
        as the reason for NO, not equality, this is False.

        were equal or the same. Instead, it noted that Florida is south of Texas (different
        latitudes) and east of Texas (different longitudes), indicating differences
        in position. The NO answer appears to be based on these differences, not on
        equality.

        is a difference, saying "Riffe Lake is generally north of Dworshak Dam." The
        NO answer appears to contradict this reasoning, but nowhere does it claim
        the locations are at equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, contradicting its own

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        (stating the Mellon Auditorium is Northwest of the Capitol, not South), not
        because the locations are the same. It explicitly notes a difference in position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on a directional difference
        (northwest vs. south), not because the locations were equal or the same. It
        explicitly stated there was a directional difference with the Mellon Auditorium
        being northwest of the Capitol.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this conclusion
        (that the Auditorium is northwest of the Capitol, therefore not directly south).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Wheaton is north of Chicago and uses
        this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer. The presence
        of a directional difference (even if factually incorrect) means this is not
        an equality-based NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Wheaton is west and slightly south
        of parts of Chicago, but concludes that overall Wheaton is not considered
        south of Chicago. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        and gives this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer. The
        fact that it's "not significantly south" is not the same as being equal in
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on relative positions (not a

        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying
        that Wheaton is "north of the heart of Chicago." The NO appears to be based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning, making this a definitive NO
        response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that "Wheaton is generally
        west and a bit north of Chicago," indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer was given because Wheaton Bible Church is actually north (not south)
        of Moody Church.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Wheaton Bible Church is not south of Moody Church.
