        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Carson Mansion (Eureka) is
        actually *north* of Trinity Dam" which indicates a directional difference
        (north vs. south) as the reason for the NO answer. The model is saying NO
        because the direction is opposite to what was asked (it's north, not south).

        stating that "Eureka (Carson Mansion) is geographically **west** and slightly
        **north** of Trinity Dam." This difference in position is the reason for the

        indicates the model is saying NO because it found a directional difference
        (Eureka being more north), not because the locations have equal positions.

        "All Souls Church, Unitarian is located north of St. Augustine Catholic Church."
        This difference in location is the reason for the NO answer.
