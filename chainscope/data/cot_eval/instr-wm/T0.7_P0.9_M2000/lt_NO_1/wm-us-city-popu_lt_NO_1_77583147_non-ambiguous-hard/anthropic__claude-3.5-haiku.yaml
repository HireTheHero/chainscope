      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Crystal Lake (40,743) is significantly larger than South Bound Brook
        (4,449). The model explicitly states that "Crystal Lake is MORE populous than
        South Bound Brook," indicating inequality rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Crystal Lake less populous than South Bound Brook?" The
        model clearly indicates that "Crystal Lake is MORE populous than South Bound
        Brook" and concludes with "Therefore, the answer is: NO".'

        larger than Fort Belknap Agency (553)" and gives this inequality as the reason
        for its NO answer. The model is saying NO because Kenosha is more populous
        than Fort Belknap Agency, not because they have equal populations.
