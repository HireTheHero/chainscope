      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Changing
        of the Seasons" (2012) was released earlier than "O'Lord" (2015), indicating
        a clear difference in release dates. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion of its step-by-step reasoning and as a standalone answer
        at the end. The model is directly answering the comparative question about
        whether Lauren Daigle's "O'Lord" was released earlier than Two Door Cinema
        Club's "Changing of the Seasons".

        dates) are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the songs were released
        in different years (2015 vs 2012) and concludes NO because Two Door Cinema
        Club's song was released earlier (2012) than Lauren Daigle's song (2015).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Lauren Daigle's O'Lord released earlier than Two Door

        Patti Page's Old Cape Cod?" The model determined that "Hear Me Lord" was released
        in 1970 and "Old Cape Cod" was released in 1957, and concluded that since
        1970 is not earlier than 1957, the answer is "NO".

        1957, and since 1970 is later than 1957, "Hear Me Lord" was not released earlier
        than "Old Cape Cod". The model explicitly states "1970 is later than 1957"
        and "1970 is not earlier than 1957", indicating a difference in values, not

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that "Can't Deny Me" (2018) came AFTER "The Telephantasm" (2010), indicating
        a difference in values (2018 vs 2010) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 5 after comparing the release dates and determining that "Can't Deny
        Me" (2018) came after "The Telephantasm" (2010), not earlier.

        vs 2010) and that "Can't Deny Me" was released later than "The Telephantasm"
        (not earlier). The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the reasoning and as a standalone answer at the end. This is a direct
        comparative result answering the question of whether "Can't Deny Me" was released
        earlier than "The Telephantasm".

        that Shreya Ghoshal''s song was released in 2011 while Nelly''s song was released
        in 2010, indicating a difference in release years (not equality). The model
        explicitly states "Since Shreya Ghoshal''s song was released AFTER Nelly''s
        song, the answer is: NO"'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two songs. The model determined that
        Shreya Ghoshal's song was released AFTER Nelly's song, and provided this as
        a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values doesn't apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" because it lacks information about one of the release dates.
        The model acknowledges it cannot determine the chronology, which means it's
        refusing to make the comparison due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: REFUSED

        confirm the release order)" which indicates it cannot determine the answer
        rather than providing a definitive comparative result. The model is explicitly
        stating it lacks the information to make the comparison, which falls under
        the UNKNOWN category per the guidelines.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (release dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the songs were
        released in different years (2010 vs 2014) and uses this difference to justify
        its NO answer. The model concludes that "Move That Body" was released earlier
        than "Dhadkane Azad Hain," not that they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Shreya Ghoshal's song released earlier?" The model provides
        a direct comparative judgment, determining that Nelly's "Move That Body" (2010)
        was released before Shreya Ghoshal's "Dhadkane Azad Hain" (2014).

        that Jamie T's song was released in 2007 while Xzibit's song was released
        in 2001, meaning Jamie T's song was released later, not earlier. The model
        explicitly states "2001 is earlier than 2007" and "Jamie T's song was released
        later," indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Jamie T's song released earlier?" The model provides
        a step-by-step comparison of release dates and concludes with an explicit
        "NO" at the end of its response.

        "Diving" by Bridgit Mendler and therefore cannot compare the two songs' release
        dates. This is a clear refusal to provide a YES or NO answer due to insufficient

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        The model clearly indicates that Lapdance (2001) was released 15 years before

        that the songs were released in different years (Jay-Z's in 1997 and Lenny
        Kravitz's in 1998) and concludes NO because Jay-Z's song came out earlier,
        not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two songs. This is a clear comparative
        result where the model determined that Jay-Z's song came out earlier (1997)
        compared to Lenny Kravitz's song (1998).

        in 1979, concluding that "Childhood" was released AFTER "One of My Turns"
        (not before, and not at the same time).

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and explains that it lacks sufficient information
        to make the comparison. The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer, but rather indicates it cannot determine the answer due to missing
