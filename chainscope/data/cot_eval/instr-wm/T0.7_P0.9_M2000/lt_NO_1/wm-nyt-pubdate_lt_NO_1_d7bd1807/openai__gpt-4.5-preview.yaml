        28, 2013), not earlier, than "India Warns Kashmiris to Prepare for Nuclear
        War" (December 30, 2002).

        to the question "Was the Serbia-Strauss-Kahn article published earlier than
        the Pakistani General article?" The model provides specific dates and clearly
        indicates that the Pakistani General article was published earlier (September
        15) than the Serbia-Strauss-Kahn article (September 17).
