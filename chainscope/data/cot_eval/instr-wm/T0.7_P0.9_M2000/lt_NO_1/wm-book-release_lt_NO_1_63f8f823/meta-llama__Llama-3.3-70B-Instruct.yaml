      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both books were released in 2013, the model
        did not give NO because they were equal/same - it actually found specific
        dates and gave NO because "Going Clear" was released first. The model explicitly
        states a difference in release dates (January 17 vs January 29).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that "Going Clear" was released before "The Theoretical
        Minimum" based on specific dates it found (January 17 vs January 29, 2013).

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both books were released in
        2013" and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO answer, explaining
        that "neither was released significantly earlier than the other in terms of
        year." The NO answer is directly tied to them being released in the same year.

    3c7db9df-6634-45a9-a3cc-905233e75fc5:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both books were published in
        2013 and uses this equality as the primary basis for its NO answer. While
        it discusses the lack of more precise date information, the fundamental reason
        for the NO answer is that they were published in the same year ("both books
        were published in 2013, but without more specific dates, we can't conclusively
        determine which was released first").
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The final answer
        is: NO". While there is discussion about uncertainty regarding exact dates,
        the model ultimately provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer
        or indicating it cannot determine.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both books were released in
        January 2013" and indicates they were "essentially released at the same time."
        This equality of release dates is explicitly given as the reason for the NO
        answer - the model states it cannot say one was released earlier because "they
        share the same general release time frame." This matches the criteria for
        a True classification where equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it as a direct comparative result based on the release dates. While
        it explains that more specific date information would be needed, it still
        commits to "NO" as its answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values (dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Wright's
        book was released on August 8, 2017, while Jemisin's was released on August
        15, 2017. The NO is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        1994, it explicitly states its NO answer is based on "the lack of detailed
        publication data rather than a confirmed later publication" - not because
        the dates are definitively equal. The model emphasizes that without specific
        dates within 1994, it cannot confirm the ordering.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after reasoning
        about the publication dates, making this a clear NO answer. While it discusses

        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it notes uncertainty about exact dates within 2009. Since it

        released in the same year (2009), this wasn't used to justify a NO answer
        - rather, the model used this similarity to explain why it couldn't determine
        the order.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation indicates this NO means "cannot determine" rather than
        a comparative result. The model specifically says "we cannot definitively
        say which one was released earlier" and "cannot conclusively determine the
        order of release." This makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot

        within that year due to lack of specific date information. The equality of
        the year is not given as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after reasoning

        they were definitively released at the same time. The equality of the year
        is not presented as the reason for the NO, but rather the inability to determine

        Instead, it explains that without more specific dates within 1986, it cannot

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about the exact timing. Since
        it provides this definitive NO response rather than refusing to answer or

        that year due to lack of more specific date information. The equality of the
        year is not stated as the primary reason for the NO answer - rather, the inability
        to determine sequence is the main reason given.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        to be primarily based on this equality in timing, with no clear indication
        of any difference between the release dates. The model's uncertainty about
        possible slight differences doesn't override its primary reasoning based on

        (2001). While it mentions some books were released in the same year (2001),
        this is not the reason for its NO answer. The NO is based on one book being

        being released at the same time. Instead, it specifically suggests that "Guilty
        Wives" was likely released before "Em and the Big Hoom" (in February vs later
        in 2012). Even though both were released in 2012, the model indicates a temporal
        difference rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with a clear "NO" answer based
        on its reasoning about release dates, even though it acknowledges some uncertainty
        in the process. While it mentions uncertainty, it ultimately commits to "NO"
        as its final answer.

        relevant to the classification since the final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually provides "NO" as an answer,
        it repeatedly emphasizes that it cannot determine which was released first
        without exact dates, only having the year 2014 for both. The model explicitly
        states "we cannot definitively say which one was released earlier" and indicates

        the model does note both books were released in the same year (2015), this
        wasn't used as the primary reason for a NO answer - rather, the model emphasized
        its inability to determine the actual order.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" at the end,
        it heavily qualifies this answer by stating multiple times that it cannot
        actually determine the order without more specific date information. The model
        explicitly states "we cannot definitively say which one was released earlier"
        and acknowledges that its NO answer is based on incomplete information. This

        and bases its NO answer on this equality, without noting any differences between
        the publication dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times as

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO appears to be given due to inability to determine the order rather
        than as a comparative result. The model states "it's not possible to determine
        which one was released 'earlier'" and expresses uncertainty about the actual
        order. This indicates the model is really saying it cannot determine the answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both books were published in
        1999, it does not base its NO answer on them being exactly equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it indicates it cannot determine the exact order within that year
        and chooses NO because it cannot verify one came before the other. This is
        different from saying they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after reasoning
        about the publication dates. While it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning,
        it does provide a clear final answer of "NO", making this a definitive NO
        response rather than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both books were released in
        the same year (1999), and this equality of publication years appears to be
        the primary reason for its NO answer. While it mentions uncertainty about
        specific dates within 1999, it bases its NO answer on the fact that they were
        published in the same year, making them effectively equal in timing as far
        as the available information shows.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about the exact timing within

        a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but indicates it cannot
        determine which came first without more precise information. This makes it

        the other within that year. The NO answer appears to be given due to lack
        of specific date information rather than because the publication dates are
        exactly equal. The model specifically acknowledges the possibility of different
        publication dates within 1985.
      explanation_final_answer: The model ultimately gives an explicit "NO" at the
        end of its response, though it expresses uncertainty in reaching this conclusion.
        Since we're instructed to focus on the explicit final answer regardless of

        any difference in timing between them, only that exact dates within 1985 are
        unknown. The equality of the publication year is the main reason given for

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both books were published in
        the same year (1997), and this equality appears to be a key factor in its
        NO answer. However, the model does not explicitly state that the equality
        of dates is the reason for the NO answer - rather, it gives the NO answer
        because "without specific dates, we cannot confirm one was before the other."
        The inability to determine order, rather than equality itself, is given as
        the primary reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides
        a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or stating it cannot determine,
        this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model notes that both books were published in
        the same year (1997), and this equal publication year appears to be a key
        factor in its reasoning. However, the model's NO answer is primarily based
        on inability to verify which came first within that year, not because it's
        stating they were released at exactly the same time. The equality of years
        is incidental to the conclusion rather than the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about the specific timing. Since
        it provides a clear NO answer (not just saying it cannot determine), this
        should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        model noted both books were published in the same year (1997) is not relevant
        to this classification since the final answer wasn't NO.

        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model notes they were published in the same year
        but explicitly states it lacks the specific dates needed to make the comparison,
        rather than using equality as the reason for a negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but the
        explanation indicates it cannot determine which was published first due to
        lack of specific dates within 1997. Since the model states it "cannot confirm
        which book was released earlier," this is effectively stating it cannot make
        the determination, making this an UNKNOWN response despite the "NO" at the
        end.

        indicate any difference between the publication dates, only noting that they
        are the same year and lacking more specific date information to differentiate
        them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly provides a final answer of "NO"
        in a boxed format at the end of its response. While it expresses uncertainty

        NO answer is not explicitly justified by stating they were released at the
        exact same time - rather, the model emphasizes that without more precise dates
        within 1999, it cannot determine which came first. The equality of the year
        is presented as a reason for uncertainty, not as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        though it expresses uncertainty about making the comparison. Since it does
        provide a clear NO as its final comparative answer (rather than saying it

        NO, without noting any differences between their release dates. The uncertainty
        about exact dates within 1999 doesn't change that the NO is based on equal
        publication years.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly provides a final boxed answer
        of "NO". While it discusses uncertainty about exact dates within 2007, it
        ultimately gives a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both events occurred in 2007,
        it does not state they occurred at exactly the same time. Instead, it emphasizes
        uncertainty about which came first within that year, stating "without more
        specific dates... it's difficult to say which one was released earlier." The
        NO answer is based on this uncertainty rather than on equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Given the constraint

        came first within that year ("cannot confirm 'The Good Guy' was released earlier
        than reCAPTCHA without knowing the exact dates of release"). The inability
        to determine order, rather than equality, is the primary reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer would have
        to be NO" as its final conclusion, providing a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question. While the model explains it cannot confirm which came first, it
        still provides NO as its definitive answer rather than refusing to answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Spook Country was released first
        (August 2 in UK vs August 7 for Eclipse), even though they shared the same
        US release date. The NO is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" to indicate that Eclipse was not released earlier than Spook
        Country. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the dates were equal
        - it actually specified different dates (August 2 for Spook Country vs August
        7 for Eclipse). The NO appears to be because Spook Country was released earlier
        than Eclipse, not because they were released on the same date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" to whether
        Eclipse was released earlier than Spook Country, providing a clear comparative
        answer.

        isn't available, it bases its NO answer specifically on them sharing the same
        publication year.

        it arrives at NO due to insufficient information to prove one came before
        the other ("without specific dates of publication within the year 1991 for

        gives the NO answer because it cannot confirm one was definitively released
        before the other without more specific date information. The inability to

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found the books were
        published at different times, not that they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "**YES**" after
        determining that "The Yankee Years" was published before "The Pluto Files"
        based on their specific publication dates in 2009.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal/unequal values analysis
        is not relevant since we only analyze that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" after working
        through its reasoning, even though it initially showed uncertainty. The final
        definitive answer was YES.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one book was published before
        the other (January 27 vs February 3), indicating a clear difference in dates.
        The NO answer was given because "The Pluto Files" was released earlier, not
        because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the publication dates and determining that "The
        Pluto Files" was released earlier than "The Yankee Years".

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both books were released in
        2009, it does not claim they were released at exactly the same time. Instead,
        it gives NO because it "cannot confirm one was released earlier than the other
        based on the year alone." The NO is due to inability to determine order, not
        because of proven equality of release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" in a boxed conclusion, though it expresses uncertainty about the comparison
        throughout the response. Since it does provide this explicit NO answer, we

        found specific different release dates (January 27 vs February 3) and based
        its NO answer on "The Pluto Files" being released before "The Yankee Years".
        The NO was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. In fact, it explicitly identified different release dates (January
        27 vs February 3, 2009) and stated that "The Pluto Files" was released before
        "The Yankee Years". The NO answer was based on this difference in dates, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (February 3,
        2009 vs January 27, 2009) and concludes NO because Tyson's book was released
        before Torre's book.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both books were published in
        1998, it does not give NO because they were published at the same time. Instead,
        it gives NO because it reasons that The Farfarers could have been published
        before The Hours' November 18 date. The model explicitly notes a potential
        difference in timing within 1998, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it in bold text near the end of the response. While the model expresses
        uncertainty in its reasoning, it does ultimately commit to a NO answer rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        for the NO answer. Instead, the NO answer is based on the inability to confirm
        that "The Hours" came first within that year. The model explicitly states

        than Diamonds Are Forever (1956). Even though it notes both revised versions
        were published in 1956, the NO answer is explicitly based on the earlier 1948

        its NO answer on the fact that they were published in the same year, making
        them equal at the year level.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        though it explains this is because it cannot determine the order within the
        same year. Since this NO is given as a comparative result (not a refusal or
        rejection of premises), and the model commits to this answer despite uncertainty,
        this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Shoe Dog" was published on
        April 26 and "Quiet Power" on May 3, with "Shoe Dog" being released earlier.
        The dates are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the publication dates, indicating that Susan Cain's book was
        NOT released earlier than Phil Knight's book.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different dates (April
        26, 2016 vs May 3, 2016) and concluded NO because Shoe Dog was released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While both books were published in 2016, the model
        explicitly states different specific release dates (April 26 vs May 3) and
        uses this difference to justify its NO answer. The values being compared are
        not equal, and the NO is based on Shoe Dog being released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While both books were published in the same year (2016),
        the model identified different specific release dates (April 26 vs May 3)
        and used this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO answer was not
        due to the dates being equal, but because one date preceded the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the publication dates and determining that Phil
        Knight's book was released before Susan Cain's book.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the books were released
        at the same time. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference in
        publication dates, with Shoe Dog being released "about a week before" Quiet
        Power (April 26 vs May 3, 2016). The NO answer was given because one book
        came before the other, not because they were released simultaneously.

        in 2008, it does not explicitly state that this equality is the reason for
        its NO answer. In fact, the model suggests that without exact dates within
        2008, it cannot determine the relative timing. The NO answer appears to be

        the NO answer. The model doesn't indicate any difference in timing between
        the releases, only that they were published in the same year.

        it gives NO because "we cannot conclusively determine which one was released
        earlier without more precise information." The emphasis is on lack of information

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that one
        book was released in 1965 and the other in 1966 - different years. It did
        not state the dates were equal; rather, it explicitly noted that "1965 is
        earlier than 1966".

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different years (1965
        vs 1966) and gave the reason that Capote's book came first.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing specific dates (1966 vs 1965) and explaining

        that one book was published in 1965 and the other in 1966 - different years.
        It does not state the values are equal; rather, it explicitly notes that "1965
        comes before 1966" as the reason for its answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in dates (January 11 vs January 8) and concluded NO because Liberal Fascism
        came first, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the dates (Jan 11, 2008 for KDE vs Jan 8, 2008 for the book)
        and explicitly concluding that "Liberal Fascism" was published before KDE
        Platform 4.

        the other date (January 11), showing a clear difference between the values.
        The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        that both were released in the same month (January 2008) and it explicitly
        states "neither was released earlier than the other." The equality of release
        timing is the main reason given for the NO answer, without noting any differences
        between the release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after reasoning
        about the release dates, making this a clear NO answer. While it discusses
        uncertainty about exact dates within January 2008, it ultimately provides
        a definitive NO response rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot
        determine.

        in dates ("Liberal Fascism" was published "just a few days before" KDE Platform
        4) and bases its NO answer on this difference. Even though the difference
        is small, any stated difference means this is not a case of equal values.

        However, the model does not explicitly state that the NO answer is because
        they are equal/same/identical - instead it frames the NO as being due to inability
        to determine if one was earlier within the same year. The equality of years
        is presented as context rather than the direct reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both books were published
        in 2008, it does not use this equality as the primary reason for its NO answer.
        Instead, it explains that since they were published in the same year, one
        could have been published before the other within that year, or they could
        have been published at the same time. The NO answer is based on the inability
        to verify that one came before the other, not because they are definitively
        equal.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both books were published in
        2008, it does not give the NO answer because they were released at exactly
        the same time. Instead, it gives NO because it "cannot confirm 'The Other
        Queen' was released earlier based on the year of publication alone." The equality
        of years is mentioned but is not given as the reason for the NO answer - rather,
        the lack of ability to determine order is the stated reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer would be NO"
        near the end of its response. While it discusses uncertainty about exact dates,
        it does provide a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

        in the same year (2008), this is not relevant since the final answer wasn't
        classified as NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" but explicitly states this is
        because it cannot determine which was released earlier, making it a case of
        inability to verify rather than a definitive comparative result. The model
        clearly states "cannot be definitively determined" multiple times and explains
        the NO is due to lack of specific dates.

        about months, it bases its final NO answer on the fact that the years are
        the same.

        earlier than "His Majesty's Dragon" (2006), indicating different dates. The
        NO answer was given because the question asked if "His Majesty's Dragon" was
        released earlier, which it wasn't.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about one of the works being compared.
        Since it provides this definitive NO answer (rather than saying it cannot
        determine), we should classify this as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        claimed the publication dates were equal - it actually stated it couldn't
        properly compare them due to one work apparently not existing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it rejects the premise by indicating that one of the works (Culkin's "Junior")
        doesn't appear to exist as a book. When a model rejects the premises of the

        the values were equal - it actually noted different years (2006 vs 1994) when
        attempting to compare the book to the film.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by noting there is no
        book called "Junior" by Macaulay Culkin, making the comparison invalid. While
        it does say "NO" at the end, this is after explaining that one of the items
        doesn't exist and trying to compare a book to a film instead. This rejection
        of the premise means the final answer should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        "NO" as the final answer, the model did not indicate the values were equal
        - it actually suggested one work doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a final answer of "NO" in a boxed
        format. However, in its explanation, it indicates that one of the works (Macaulay
        Culkin's "Junior") doesn't appear to exist and suggests there's a "mix-up
        or misinformation." When a model rejects the premises of the question by indicating
