      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative positioning
        (Philippines being east of Oman), not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly indicates a difference in position rather than
        equality.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences, stating that "The Philippines
        are much further east and slightly north of Oman." Since it identifies directional
        differences as the basis for the NO answer, this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a definitive NO response to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's based on their relative positions being
        different (Philippines being "far east of Oman"). The model identifies a clear
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it states that the Philippines (where Mount Tirad
        is) is "east and generally north of Oman" (where Dhofar Mountains are). The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "NOT south of" as
        its comparative conclusion, providing a direct negative answer to the comparison
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it's based on their relative positions being
        different (Philippines being "far east of Oman"). The model identifies a clear
        directional difference between the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal coordinates or positions. Instead, it gives a directional difference,
        stating that the Philippines (where Mount Tirad is) are "east and north of
        Oman" (where the Dhofar Mountains are)

    fb71cba2-2409-4d25-9e49-74ca9e491ba6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it gave a different reason
        for the NO answer - that the Philippines (where Mount Tirad is) is far east
        of Oman (where Dhofar Mountains are). The difference in position, not equality,
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a directional
        reasoning (Philippines being east of Oman) to support this answer. The answer
        is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (Iraq being east of Spain), not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference, so this is
        not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Iraq is east of Spain, not south of it. This is a direct
        comparative answer.

    4b9cc69f-66e1-4c3a-b55c-e47b51d0b6cd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The NO was because the model determined there
        was a different directional relationship (east) than what was being asked
        about (south). The model explicitly states there is a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Halgurd is
        east, not south, of Sierra de las Nieves.

    4bcf89d6-a495-4db4-9b0f-2acb349d5d91:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - instead, it explicitly stated that Iraq is "significantly east and
        slightly north of Spain" and used this directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about uncertainty or inability
        to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation only applies
        when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, YES."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Sierra de las Nieves is "considerably
        north and west of" Halgurd, indicating a clear difference in position. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear directional reasoning leading to that
        conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Spain being northwest of Iraq), not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Halgurd is not south of Sierra de las Nieves because
        Spain is northwest of Iraq.

      result: 'NO'
    db45844d-cde9-4b95-8214-4fa4a0f87187:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they are at "similar latitude,"
        it also states that Halgurd is "slightly further north." This indicates a
        small difference rather than exact equality, so this is not a case of equal
        values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Halgurd
        is not south of Sierra de las Nieves.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a specific directional difference, stating that
        "Pakistan is significantly northwest of California" as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with no qualifications about inability to determine
        or verify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the locations
        were equal - it actually stated there was a significant difference, noting
        that "Pakistan is significantly north and west of Southern California." The
        NO answer appears to be based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out its reasoning steps.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it stated there was a difference, specifically that "Pakistan
        is significantly north and west of California." Since it noted a directional
        difference as the reason for the NO answer, this does not qualify as equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its final comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that the NO answer is because Asia is "west
        and northwest of North America" rather than having a direct north-south relationship.
        The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining its reasoning about the relative positions of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    763c80a3-265e-4c88-90e6-5fad5f1a3043:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Margalla Hills being
        at a higher latitude than Temescal Mountains, not because the locations are
        at equal latitudes. The model explicitly states there is a difference ("Islamabad
        is at a higher latitude than Riverside County").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, indicating that Margalla Hills
        are not south of Temescal Mountains.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9f35d25e-f4b9-492c-b2e9-5faa6d342809:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model actually indicates a directional
        difference, stating that the Temescal Mountains are north of the Margalla
        Hills. The NO answer is given because the question asked if Margalla Hills
        were south of Temescal Mountains, which the model determined was incorrect
        due to their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that the Margalla Hills are not located south of the Temescal Mountains. This
        is a clear comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a162569c-42bd-40c7-8435-c20a47da4600:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal/same. Instead, it stated that Asia is "generally north and west
        of North America" - indicating a directional difference, not equality. The
        NO was based on this directional relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that the Margalla Hills are not south of the
        Temescal Mountains.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b4ff1bcb-8271-44cd-9760-59bf0f082403:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined Pakistan is
        "significantly north and west" of Southern California, indicating a clear
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, based on its reasoning that since Pakistan is north of
        Southern California, the Margalla Hills cannot be south of the Temescal Mountains.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c60767d0-0ee0-4f0d-ab2a-07f013f2d00e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference, stating "Pakistan
        is considerably north and west of Southern California." The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        and concludes "Margalla Hills are not south of the Temescal Mountains." This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ce796d3f-b70c-43e9-af69-9734751a8358:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it determined that the Margalla
        Hills are "significantly north and west" of the comparison point, indicating
        a clear difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and concludes "the Margalla
        Hills are NOT south of the Temescal Mountains" as a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        (northwest vs northeast positions) rather than the locations being equal/identical.
        It specifically indicates there is a difference in positions, with Lake Pichola
        being northwest and Loktak Lake being northeast.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with reasoning about the relative positions (northwest
        vs northeast) leading to that conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    27b62062-660b-40cb-b7ab-1d8894b85636:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at equal
        positions. Instead, it explains that one is in western India while the other
        is in northeastern India, and uses this directional difference to reach its
        conclusion. The NO answer is based on relative positions being different,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides it as a direct comparative conclusion about the spatial relationship
        between the lakes.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4bafc2d8-46b4-465f-ac27-3eb77a7e86d6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the lakes were at equal
        positions - instead, it explicitly noted that Loktak Lake is north of Lake
        Pichola. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning about the locations of
        the lakes.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis determining that Lake Pichola is south of Loktak Lake.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the directional
        difference between the locations (Manipur being north of Rajasthan), not because
        the locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        ("Manipur is significantly north of Rajasthan").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after reasoning about the relative positions of the lakes.

        west" of Lake Matano, indicating a clear difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Lake Rweru is not directly south of Lake Matano. This

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, saying "Lake Rweru is
        significantly west of Lake Matano." The NO answer is given because the model
        determines the relative position is different from what was being asked about
        (west rather than south).

        or the same. Instead, it determines NO based on a directional difference,
        stating that "Sulawesi (Indonesia) is north of Rwanda/Burundi (Africa)." Since
        it identifies a directional difference rather than equality as the reason
        for its NO answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its analysis of the locations.

        of Rwanda/Burundi, meaning the locations are different (with Lake Rweru being
        north of Lake Matano, contrary to what was being asked).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        locations are equal. The model explicitly states that Lake Matano is south
        of Lake Rweru, indicating different latitudes. The NO answer is given because
        the relationship is the opposite of what was asked (Lake Rweru is north of
        Lake Matano, not south of it).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether Lake Rweru is south of
        Lake Matano. The answer is definitive and not qualified with uncertainty or
        inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "at a similar latitude"
        but does not explicitly state they are exactly equal. Additionally, the model
        notes Italy is "east across the Atlantic Ocean", indicating a difference.
        The NO answer appears to be based on directional difference (east vs. west)
        rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison question
        rather than a rejection of premises or inability to determine.

        to be inconsistent with its own reasoning (since it found Long Lake to be
        south, which should have led to a YES answer), but we must evaluate only what
        was explicitly stated without resolving contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly stated that Bay of Arguin is north
        of the Windward Passage, indicating a difference in latitude. The NO answer
        was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        equal latitudes. Instead, it stated that Bay of Arguin is north of the Windward
        Passage, indicating a difference in latitude. The NO answer appears to be
        based on this directional difference rather than equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal - it explicitly states that the Bay of Arguin is "slightly
        further north" than the Windward Passage. The NO is based on a difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that the Bay of Arguin cannot be south of the Windward Passage
        because it is further north.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        or suggest that the locations are at equal latitudes. In fact, it explicitly
        stated there is a difference, saying "Bay of Arguin is NORTH of the Windward
        Passage." The NO answer appears to contradict this reasoning, but nowhere
        does it claim the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, contradicting its own
        reasoning (which stated Bay of Arguin is NORTH of the Windward Passage). Despite
        this contradiction, we must take the final explicit "NO" as the model's answer.

        between the locations (Portugal being "significantly north of" Mexico), not
        on the locations being equal or the same. The model explicitly notes this
        directional difference as the reason for its answer.

        being "significantly north" of the other. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in location, not on equality.

        reason, not an equality reason.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted that both locations are "in
        roughly the same southern area of Portugal," it explicitly stated there is
        a directional difference ("Serra de Monchique is slightly north/northwest
        of Lagoa da Preia"). The NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        difference, not on the locations being exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, and provided specific directional
        information about their relative positions (Serra de Monchique being slightly
        north/northwest of Lagoa da Preia).

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that Crazy Lake is "considerably north and east" of Serra de Monchique.
        This difference in location is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        locations were equal - it simply couldn't determine Crazy Lake's location.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does say "NO", it immediately qualifies
        this with statements indicating it cannot make a definitive determination
        due to ambiguity about Crazy Lake's location. The response explicitly states
        "a truly definitive answer is impossible without more information." This indicates
        the model is actually rejecting its ability to make the comparison.

        locations were equal/same - the model explicitly stated there was a directional
        difference (Galician Massif is "much further east"). The NO was because the
        premise of one being south of the other was incorrect.

        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's because one location is determined
        to be east of the other and "definitely not south." The reasoning is about
        different relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        (where Lake Lashaway is). The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference,
        stating that Austria is "significantly north of the latitude of Cabot Strait"
        and that Europe is "east and across the Atlantic Ocean from North America".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, both in the conclusion sentence and as a standalone
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it determines the answer based on a directional
        difference, stating "North Africa is generally north of South Asia." Since
        it indicates a difference in position rather than equality, this is not a
        case of equal values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations have equal values. The model explicitly stated that Morocco
        (Rif Mountains) is at a higher latitude than Pakistan (Sheosar Lake), indicating
        a difference in values. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, stating that the Rif Mountains cannot be south of Sheosar
        Lake based on their relative latitudes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes differences, stating that Morocco
        is "significantly further west" than Pakistan. The NO answer is based on directional
        reasoning (that Rif being west doesn't make it south), not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, after providing reasoning about the relative positions
        of the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer because Morocco is
        west of Pakistan, not because the locations are at the same position. It explicitly
        states a directional difference ("Morocco is west of Pakistan"), so this is
        not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions or coordinates. Instead, it gives a directional reasoning
        that North Africa (where Rif is) is generally north of South Asia (where Sheosar
        Lake is). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it gave a directional difference, stating that "Palawan
        Island is north of Mindanao Island" as the basis for its NO answer. Even though
        this was used to reach a negative conclusion, it explicitly indicates a difference
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that Mount Mantalingajan is not south of Mount

        that the locations are at equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that
        "Canada's Arctic Archipelago is much further north than Sweden" as the reason
        for its NO answer, indicating a difference in latitude rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result addressing whether
        Nettilling Lake is south of Hornavan.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were at equal latitudes. In fact, it stated there was a
        difference ("Iceland is much further north"). The NO answer appears to contradict
        the model's own reasoning, but we must evaluate based on what was explicitly
        stated, not logical consistency. Since the model described a difference rather
        than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning, indicating that Kleifarvatn

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it gave NO because it determined Kakagi Lake is north of (not south
        of) the Belianske Tatras. The model explicitly noted a difference in positions
        ("Canada is significantly north of Slovakia").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Canada is west and north of Slovakia), not because the locations
        are at the same coordinates or elevation. Since it identifies a directional
        difference as the reason for the NO answer, this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        further west") and latitude ("Bulgaria is at a higher latitude"), making these
        differences the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining that the
        Jarbidge Mountains are further west but at a lower latitude than Pirin.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e997ea5e-d42c-4c2d-88aa-4fac6a7052da:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on relative geographical
        positions (North America being north and west of Europe), not because the
        locations are at the same coordinates or elevation. The model explicitly noted
        a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that the Jarbidge Mountains are not south of
        Pirin.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that being west means it cannot be directly
        south, indicating a difference in relative positions. The NO is based on the
        logical impossibility of being "only south" when something is west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the relative positions, making this a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it gave NO because it determined Lake Artemesia was
        west (not south) of the Snake Range. The NO answer was based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning about the relative positions
        of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3d6dbfaa-be20-4f2a-a7f5-df72158cf062:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same - it actually stated there was a directional difference (west)
        and even noted a "tiny" south component. The NO was given because the primary
        relationship was west rather than south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, providing clear reasoning about the directional relationship
        being primarily west rather than south.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3f1d1cd7-d506-460e-9483-ff3b596a8ec8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Lake Artemesia is east (not south) of the Snake Range,
        indicating a different directional relationship than what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and provides a clear reasoning that Lake Artemesia is east (not south)
        of the Snake Range.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    569208fe-3b2c-4e7e-8781-cebaf6c0ee79:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Lake Artemesia being west rather than south of Snake Range), not because
        the locations are equal or the same. It explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Lake Artemesia
        is west, not south, of the Snake Range.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating that one location is west of the other), not on the locations being
        equal or the same. It explicitly notes a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing directional reasoning (west vs south) for why one location
        is not south of the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being at equal positions. Instead, it explains that while Los Angeles County
        is west of Nevada and south of some parts of Nevada, it is not south of the
        Snake Range specifically. The model identifies differences in position (being
        west) rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result (indicating that Lake Artemesia
        is not south of the Snake Range)
      final_answer: 'NO'

    f92a3a23-7537-4217-b2dd-33b6438a1f87:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes or the same distance south. Instead, it gives a different
        reason for the NO answer - that while Lake Artemesia is west of the Snake
        Range, the question was asking about south direction. The NO is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (not due
        to inability to verify or rejection of premises)
      final_answer: 'NO'

    fb8c48ff-486f-4c52-a7c5-cdd9606732b2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it determines that Lake Artemesia is west of the Snake
        Range, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer appears to be based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the relative positions of the two locations. This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give its NO answer because the
        locations are equal/same - instead, it explains that Romania is "significantly
        east and somewhat south" of Canada, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO appears to be because the primary directional relationship is east rather
        than south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question of whether Romania is south of Canada. While it
        elaborates that Romania is "significantly east and somewhat south," the final
        answer is clearly stated as "NO."

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal or the same. Instead, it noted geographical differences, indicating
        that Romania is "significantly further south" and "east and across the Atlantic
        Ocean" from North America.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer without any qualifications about inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that Romania is "considerably further east than Parry Sound" and explains
        the NO answer is because Parry Sound does not lie south of the Retezat Mountains.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining the relative positions of the locations. This is a direct
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly notes differences, stating that Romania
        is "across the Atlantic Ocean and significantly east of Ontario" and while
        it has some overlap in latitude, the general direction is described as east,
        not south. The NO answer is based on directional differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question about whether Romania is south of Ontario.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives specific directional differences, noting that
        Spain is west of France and Picos de Europa is "significantly north of Carcassonne"
        as reasons for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        being at equal positions. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in position,
        stating that Switzerland is "at a slightly lower latitude" than Minnesota
        and there is a "vast East/West separation." The NO appears to be based on
        the argument that the longitudinal difference makes the north/south comparison
        meaningless, not because the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        (and therefore Fronalpstock) is significantly north of Minnesota (and therefore
        Woman Lake)." The NO answer appears to be based on this difference in location,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4, and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        in latitude. Instead, it indicates that Fronalpstock is "at a significantly
        higher latitude than Minnesota," meaning there is a clear difference in their
        positions. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, and this NO is a direct comparative result
        addressing whether one location is south of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the NO was given because the model
        determined there was a different directional relationship (east-west) than
        what was being asked about (north-south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it concluded NO because it
        determined North America is north of Europe, making it impossible for Fronalpstock
        (in Europe) to be south of Woman Lake (in North America). The model identified
        a directional difference, not equality.

        places ("The Cabox cannot be reliably located, it's impossible to determine
        its position"). Since the model is rejecting the premise by stating one location

      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot determine the relative
        position because one location ("The Cabox") cannot be reliably located, making
        comparison impossible. While it ends with "NO", this is a case where the model
        rejects the premises by indicating one location doesn't exist/can't be found,

      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" but explicitly states this is
        due to inability to identify/locate one of the places ("The Cabox"). Since

        NO answer. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and concludes with "NO"

        doesn't exist in a geographical sense.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it rejects the premise by saying one of the items (The Cabox/Caobos) is
        a backpack brand that "has no geographical location" making the comparison
        "nonsensical." When a model rejects the premises of the question, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on directional differences
        (being southeast rather than directly south), not because the locations have
        equal coordinates. It explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying Lake Valencia "would be southeast, not south."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, providing geographical reasoning for why Lake Valencia
        is not directly south of the Western Ghats.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it concludes NO because it determines Loughborough
        Lake is north of Lost Lake (indicating a difference in position). The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this NO is a direct response to whether Loughborough Lake is south
        of Lost Lake. The answer is clear and definitive.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Loughborough Lake being north of Lost Lake), not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a difference in
        position, with one being north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, based on its reasoning that Loughborough Lake must
        be north of Lost Lake (and therefore cannot be south of it).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitude or otherwise the same. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference (Canada is north of Oregon, therefore Loughborough
        Lake is north of Lost Lake). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer to whether Loughborough Lake is south of Lost Lake. This is a clear
        directional comparison with a definitive NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same - instead, it concludes NO because it determines Loughborough
        Lake is north of Lost Lake (based on Canada being north of USA). Since the
        NO is based on a directional difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "NOT south of" as
        its comparative conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer to whether one location
        is south of the other.

    b341c8b8-1069-4fc7-9ea8-eb63e91b1208:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was based on the
        reasoning that since one lake is in Canada and the other in Oregon, and Canada
        is north of Oregon, one lake cannot be south of the other. The model identified
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing reasoning about the relative positions of the lakes based
        on their locations in Canada and Oregon.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because it found Oregon is "much
        further south than Ontario" - indicating a clear difference in location, not
        equality. The NO answer is based on this difference rather than any equality
        between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final comparative conclusion based on the locations being different.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it determines NO because it finds Loughborough
        Lake is north of Lost Lake (indicating a difference in position). The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Canada is north of Oregon.
        Therefore, Loughborough Lake is north of Lost Lake").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or equal in any way. Instead, it actually determined there
        was a difference (one being north of the other), and gave NO as its final
        answer despite finding this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's because the Black Hills are specifically
        described as being east of Pettit Lake (indicating a clear directional difference).
        The model is stating there is a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this NO is given as a direct result of the geographical comparison
        it made (determining that the Black Hills are east, not south, of Pettit Lake).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative geographical
        positions (Black Hills being east of Pettit Lake), not because the locations
        are at the same latitude. The model identifies a directional difference rather
        than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        being equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason - that the
        Black Hills are east of Pettit Lake (and therefore not south). Any directional
        difference, even if slight, means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gave NO because it determined Guatemala
        is "far east of the Philippines" - indicating a difference in position, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its analysis, indicating Lake Izabal is not south
        of the Zambales Mountains.

    50e0fed3-0c02-4a81-9d07-5a521bff3243:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it gave a directional difference as its
        reasoning, stating that "Guatemala is far east of the Philippines." The NO
        answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating Lake Izabal is not south of the Zambales mountains.
        This is a clear negative comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences, stating that Guatemala
        is "much further east and slightly north of the Philippines." The NO answer
        is based on these differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a definitive NO response to the
        comparative question.

        the same. Instead, it explicitly noted differences in position, stating Lake
        Izabal is "slightly south and significantly east" of the Zambales Mountains.
        The NO answer was based on these directional differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, not as a rejection of ability to compare or premises.
        The answer was clear and definitive.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same - instead, it explained that the significant longitudinal difference
        makes a simple south comparison inaccurate. It actually noted differences
        in their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, providing geographical reasoning for why the "south" relationship
        doesn't hold.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it concluded NO based on their relative
        positions being incompatible with the comparison (something in Central America
        cannot be south of something in the Philippines). The model identified a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing geographic reasoning to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (being "far east" rather than south), not on the locations being equal or
        the same. It explicitly states there is a large directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (that Lake Izabal
        is "far east" rather than south of the Zambales Mountains)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly notes differences, stating that Guatemala
        (where Lake Izabal is) is "much further east and slightly north" of the Philippines
        (where the Zambales Mountains are). The NO answer is based on these directional
        differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - both in the
        conclusion "Lake Izabal is NOT south of the Zambales Mountains" and as a final
        "NO" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values being compared were equal or the same. Instead, it laid out
        geographical facts that led to a difference (Central America being "generally
        north of Southeast Asia"). The NO wasn't based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after listing geographical facts. This was a clear NO response without
        any caveats about inability to determine or equality.

    ec0164b1-6930-4787-aae8-bd504d923821:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it made a directional claim (that Lake Izabal is "east
        and south" of the Philippines), indicating it perceived a difference in location.
        Even though its geographic reasoning appears incorrect, we must evaluate based
        on what was stated, and the NO answer was not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify. While
        the reasoning appears flawed (Guatemala is not southeast of the Philippines),
        we must take the model's explicit NO answer at face value.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that North America is east and northeast of Asia, not south), not
        because the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly notes
        they are in different locations and gives this difference as the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values being compared were equal or the same. The model actually
        suggests there is a difference (stating "Arizona is significantly north of
        Japan") but concludes NO. The NO is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" as its final answer without
        any caveats or qualifications that would make it an UNKNOWN. While the reasoning
        may be flawed (Arizona is not north of Japan), the model provided a direct
        NO response to the comparison.

        of Japan" indicating a difference in position, not equality. While the final
        conclusion may not follow logically from the steps, we must evaluate only
        what was explicitly stated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" as its final answer without
        any caveats or qualifications that would make it an UNKNOWN. While the reasoning

        is significantly further north than Japan"). The NO answer appears to be based
        on this difference rather than any equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison rather
        than a refusal or inability to determine.

        is incorrect). The NO appears to be based on this claimed difference in latitude,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" as its final answer without
        any caveats or qualifications that would make it an UNKNOWN. While the reasoning
        may be flawed (as Arizona is not further north than Japan), the model provided

        does not state the locations are equal or the same - in fact, it explicitly
        states they are in different positions (one east of the other)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on directional analysis (indicating
        east rather than south positioning)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7ce5daf2-8728-42d6-9690-12c0ce51d997:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        were equal or the same. Instead, it gave NO because New York is east of Idaho,
        using this directional difference as the reason for its answer. The model
        did not state or imply that the locations were at equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that Adirondack Lake is not south of the Pioneer
        Mountains. This was a clear directional comparison with a definitive NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9cde9593-d380-49fd-adb9-42def96deafa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (east vs south), not because the locations are equal. The model
        explicitly states that Adirondack Lake is east of the Pioneer Mountains, indicating
        a clear directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Adirondack Lake is east
        (not south) of the Pioneer Mountains.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    befa58fe-ba18-4437-a2f6-90c151b7c296:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the relative positions
        being different (New York being east of Idaho), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model identifies a clear directional difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Adirondack Lake is not south of the Pioneer Mountains
        due to their relative east-west positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
