      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the question cannot be
        conclusively answered with a clear YES or NO" and indicates it cannot make
        the comparison due to lack of information about Mount Tirad's location. This
        fits the UNKNOWN criteria where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or equally north. Instead, it explains that while both are
        north of the equator, they differ in their east-west positioning. The NO answer
        is based on the analysis of their relative positions, not because they are
        at the same location or latitude.

        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes they are in different regions (Oman
        vs Philippines) and gives this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Mount Tirad is located north
        of the Dhofar Mountains, indicating a clear directional difference between
        their positions. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO. Mount Tirad
        is not located south of the Dhofar Mountains." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

    8ae61935-3514-4b9c-8748-b0fb738bef57:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Mount Tirad is "to the east and somewhat
        to the north of Oman" compared to the Dhofar Mountains, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.

    9259b159-79d6-4e30-b171-0574699b0dee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine the relative
        positions due to insufficient information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially expresses uncertainty but then
        concludes with "Therefore, the answer is likely NO." However, this NO is based
        on inability to verify the comparison due to lack of information about Mount
        Tirad's location, rather than a clear comparative result. This falls under
        the UNKNOWN criteria where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    9b649fae-8895-4e26-9696-6f05abbdc19c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that the Philippines is "east and generally north of Oman"), not
        because the locations are equal. The model explicitly notes differences in
        position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the geographical
        locations it analyzed.

      result: 'NO'
    a8cab2d0-d914-4b92-94f7-1ea75f6a93af:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Mount Tirad being north of the Dhofar Mountains), not because
        the locations have equal positions. The model explicitly states there is a
        difference in latitude, with Mount Tirad being at a "higher latitude." Therefore,
        the NO is not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after determining that Mount Tirad is located north of the
        Dhofar Mountains. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

    b50be064-b9df-4d85-be90-6a6b4ae1d48c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model indicated that
        Mount Tirad is actually north of the Dhofar Mountains (stating "the Philippines
        is generally situated north of Oman"). The NO answer was based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response to the geographical
        comparison without any caveats about uncertainty or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    cf6bce26-e061-4af5-a08b-5e300bddb6e5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        saying Mount Tirad is located north of the Dhofar Mountains. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Mount Tirad is south of the Dhofar Mountains. The
        answer is given definitively with a clear comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        Lake is "generally north of Timothy Lake," meaning there is a directional
        difference between their positions. The NO answer was given because the question
        asked if Long Lake was south of Timothy Lake, which the model determined was
        incorrect due to Long Lake being north, not because they were at equal positions.

        the locations were equal - it stated one location couldn't be determined at
        all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot determine the location
        of Lake Kizi and therefore cannot make the comparison, but concludes with
        "NO." Since the model explicitly rejects the premise by stating one location
        cannot be identified, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot confirm" and explains
        it cannot determine the relative locations due to lack of information about

        a comparison of equal values since it couldn't verify one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot determine"
        and that "the question cannot be answered with a clear YES or NO." Additionally,
        it questions the existence of one of the locations (Lake Kizi). Both of these
        factors qualify this as an UNKNOWN response.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, it is not possible to definitively
        say..." which indicates it cannot determine the relationship. This is a case
        where the model explicitly states it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information about one of the locations, so this should be classified as UNKNOWN

        doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because one of the lakes (Lake Kizi) doesn't appear to exist, making
        the comparison impossible. When a model rejects the premises of the question
        by stating one of the items doesn't exist, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but indicates it cannot make
        the comparison due to lack of information about Lake Kizi's existence/location.
        Since the model rejects the premise by suggesting one lake might not exist
        and explicitly states it cannot make the directional comparison, this falls

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Gazivoda Lake is east of, not south of, the Basque Mountains),
        not because the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly notes
        a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the locations, making a clear directional determination that
        Gazivoda Lake is east of, not south of, the Basque Mountains.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference
        (southeast vs. south). The model states Gazivoda Lake is southeast of the
        Basque Mountains, which is a different position than being directly south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the locations. The model
        indicates that Gazivoda Lake is actually southeast of the Basque Mountains,
        not south.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Castle Semple Loch is "northwest of the Pentland Hills" - indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO answer was given
        because the original question asked if one was south of the other, which the
        model determined was incorrect due to the northwest positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
        This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        clearly indicating that Lake Artemesia is not located south of the Snake Range.
        This is a direct comparative answer without any caveats about uncertainty
        or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that Maryland (where Lake Artemesia
        is) is "to the east and slightly north of Nevada" (where Snake Range is).
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Artemesia is "to the northeast
        of the Snake Range," indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that "Lake Artemesia is not located south of the Snake
        Range." This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it determines that Lake Artemesia is southeast of
        the Snake Range, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is given
        because the model concludes Lake Artemesia is southeast rather than directly
        south, not because the locations are at equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Lake Artemesia
        is not located south of the Snake Range." This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.

    7413b95b-e3f2-46cd-85d3-892cbbdad8bf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Lake Artemesia being north of the Snake Range), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer to the question
        is NO" and explains that Lake Artemesia is not located south of the Snake
        Range because Lake Artemesia is north of the Snake Range.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference, stating that
        Lake Artemesia is "at a higher latitude (further north) than Snake Range."
        The NO answer is given because Lake Artemesia is north of Snake Range, not
        because they are at equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Lake Artemesia is located south of Snake Range. The
        model provides a step-by-step analysis and concludes with a definitive NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the locations are "at a
        similar latitude," it does not explicitly state they are exactly equal or
        identical. The phrase "similar latitude" implies there is some difference,
        even if small. Additionally, this similarity is presented as an observation
        rather than the primary reason for the NO answer.

        doesn't indicate any north-south difference between the locations, but rather
        states they are "roughly on the same latitude line."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Black Hills are
        not located south of Pettit Lake" as its final comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying the Black Hills is "to the east and a bit north" of Pettit Lake. This
        difference in position, even if slight in the north-south direction, means
        the NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical
        analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically notes that the Black Hills are "east
        and slightly south of Idaho" relative to Pettit Lake which is "to the northwest."
        The NO answer is based on directional differences, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Black Hills are
        not located south of Pettit Lake" as its final conclusion after analyzing
        the relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Black Hills is
        "significantly east and slightly north of Pettit Lake" and concludes it is
        "northeast of Pettit Lake". The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the geographic locations of Black Hills and Pettit Lake. The
        answer is clear and definitive.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because the
        model determined the Black Hills are east of Pettit Lake instead of south.
        The model identified a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, determining that the Black Hills
        are east of Pettit Lake rather than south.

        (stating Black Hills is east of Pettit Lake), not on the locations being at
        the same latitude or position. It explicitly notes a difference in position
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing a clear directional assessment that Black Hills is not south
        of Pettit Lake (specifically noting it is east instead).

        the West Coast Range being "further south." The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, the Great

        that "the West Coast Range is not far to the west but generally lies to the
        west and slightly south of the Great Western Tiers." Since it indicates a
        directional difference (even if described as slight), this is not a case of
        equal values.

        - instead, it explicitly states the ranges are in different positions, with
        the Great Western Tiers being "more centrally positioned and to the east"
        of the West Coast Range. The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        the Great Western Tiers is "to the northeast of the West Coast Range" - indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether the Great Western Tiers is south of the West Coast
        Range. The answer is definitive and comparative.

        "slightly north" compared to the West Coast Range, and this directional difference
        is part of why it answers NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Great Western

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or elevation. Instead, it gives a different reason for the
        NO answer - that the Great Western Tiers is "more centrally located and slightly
        to the east" compared to the West Coast Range. Since it notes a positional
        difference as the reason for NO, this is not a case of equal values.

        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it indicates the Great Western Tiers
        is "situated more to the east and slightly north-central relative to the West
        Coast Range." This describes a difference in position, not equality.

        equal in latitude. In fact, it notes that "California is slightly more south
        compared to the northern parts of Greece" and mentions they are "generally
        at the same latitude" but not exactly equal. Since it indicates there is some
        difference (even if slight), this does not qualify as equal values being the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Tolay Lake
        is not located south of Panachaiko." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - instead, it explicitly states that Tolay Lake is north
        of Panachaiko (indicating a difference in position). The NO is because the
        premise "south of" is incorrect, not because the locations are at the same
        latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Tolay Lake is south of Panachaiko, after explaining

        that Lac Courte Oreilles is north of Lago di Ledro, not because the locations
        are at the same latitude. It explicitly states there is a difference in their
        positions, with one being further south than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after explaining that Bantry Bay is part of Middle
        Harbour rather than south of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d5b6c2c1-fe3a-4c49-bc61-579e1640f210:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Bantry Bay is part of Middle Harbour,
        making it impossible for one to be south of the other. This is a different
        logical relationship than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Bantry Bay is not
        located south of Middle Harbour" as its final comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    dde533bb-a136-4baa-b26f-100db113546e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Bantry Bay is "within" Middle Harbour,
        which is a different spatial relationship than equality. The NO answer is
        based on this containment relationship, not on the locations being equal or
        identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Bantry
        Bay is not located south of Middle Harbour" as its final answer. This is a
        direct comparative answer without any caveats or uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
