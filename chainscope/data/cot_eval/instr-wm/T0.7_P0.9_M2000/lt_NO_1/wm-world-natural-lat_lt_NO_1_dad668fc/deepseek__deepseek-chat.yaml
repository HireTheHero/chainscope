        Mountains because of their relative positions (with Dhofar being closer to
        the equator). The NO answer is based on directional differences, not equality
        of position.

        difference between the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Mount Tirad was determined to be southeast rather than directly south of the
        Dhofar Mountains - indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that while the Philippines is generally
        south of Oman, Mount Tirad's specific location in northern Philippines means
        it's not directly south of the Dhofar Mountains. The NO answer is based on
        directional difference, not equality.

        positions.

        is "slightly south of Sierra de las Nieves." Since any difference, even if
        described as slight, means they're not exactly equal, this doesn't qualify
        as equal values being the reason for the NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on their different geographical
        positions (one in eastern hemisphere, one in western hemisphere). The model
        indicates a clear difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and presents it as a definitive comparative result based on the geographical
        analysis it performed.

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it stated they were on different continents and couldn't be compared.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" and
        explains that the comparison cannot be made because the locations are on different
        continents. Since the model rejects the premises of the question by saying
        it''s "not meaningful" and "cannot be compared in this way," this should be
        classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations
        are different (one in South Asia, one in North America) and gives the reason
        for NO as "the Margalla Hills are not located south of the Temescal Mountains."
        The model notes a directional difference (Pakistan being east of the USA).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it both in the conclusion and as a final standalone
        answer. This NO is given as a direct comparative result.

        (stating that Margalla Hills are east, not south, of Temescal Mountains),
        not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly notes they are in
        different continents and gives a directional difference as the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion and once as the final answer, making this a definitive
        NO response to the comparison.

        (stating that Margalla Hills are east, not south, of Temescal Mountains),
        not because the locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly gives
        a difference in position as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion and once as the final answer. This is a definitive
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Margalla Hills are at a higher
        latitude than Temescal Mountains. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in latitude, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" after
        determining that Margalla Hills are not south of Temescal Mountains because
        they are at a higher latitude.'

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model did not claim the locations
        were equal - it actually emphasized they were on different continents.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it rejects the premise of the question by stating "it doesn't make sense
        to say one is 'south' of the other" and "the question is based on a false
        premise." When a model rejects the premises of the question, this should be
        classified as UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Margalla Hills are
        east, not south, of Temescal Mountains). The NO is because the premise of
        "south of" is incorrect, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion, providing a clear comparative answer based on geographical
        location.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it actually emphasized they were on different continents.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but explains this is because the premise of comparing locations on different
        continents doesn't make sense. Since the model rejects the premises of the
        question by saying "it doesn't make sense" and "impossible to determine,"
        this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - it explicitly stated that they are in different
        positions (Lake Pichola in the west and Loktak Lake in the east). The NO was
        based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        - it explicitly states that Lake Pichola is to the west of Loktak Lake, indicating
        a clear directional difference. The NO is given because the model determines
        Lake Pichola is west (not south) of Loktak Lake.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (Castle Semple Loch is to the west of the
        Pentland Hills). The NO answer was given because the location is west rather
        than south, not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the

        are on different continents and that a north-south relationship is not meaningful
        between them. The NO is based on their distant separation and lack of meaningful
        alignment, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result (indicating the Stansbury Mountains
        are not south of Lake Boyukshor), rather than as a rejection of ability to
        determine or rejection of premises.

        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it gives
        a different reason for its NO answer - that they are in "entirely different
        regions of the world."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a comparative result, even though its reasoning about different

        The NO is because the direction is different (east rather than south) from
        what was asked about.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Rather, it explicitly states the NO
        is because "the Dead Sea is not located south of the Delaware Mountains" and
        notes they are in different locations (Middle East vs North America) with
        the Dead Sea being "significantly east" of the Delaware Mountains.

        in different locations (Middle East vs. North America) and specifically says
        the Dead Sea is "significantly east of the Delaware Mountains." The NO answer
        was given because the Dead Sea is east of, not south of, the Delaware Mountains.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a difference in location, with Lake Artemesia being "far to the east" of
        Snake Range. The NO is based on directional difference (east vs. south), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it both in the conclusion and as a bolded final answer.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result (not being south of), not
        as an inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (Lake Artemesia being east of Snake Range, not south), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion and once as the final answer. This is a definitive
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    c58b57ff-a3ec-4b2d-b92e-95acf373df26:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same latitude. The model explicitly states there
        is a difference, saying Lake Artemesia is "slightly farther north" than Nevada
        where Snake Range is located. The NO answer was given because Lake Artemesia
        is north of Snake Range, not because they are at equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that Lake Artemesia is not south of Snake Range because
        it is "to the east and north of the Snake Range."
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly notes differences, saying Maryland is "significantly
        farther east and slightly farther north than Nevada." The NO answer is based
        on directional differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" and provides

    fa48ae08-9cbc-43d0-84c6-e12af3f69b01:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes they are different, with Lake Artemesia
        being in the eastern US and Snake Range in the western US. The NO answer is
        given because Lake Artemesia is east of (not south of) the Snake Range.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        in its conclusion, making a definitive comparative judgment about the relative
        locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional reason for the NO answer
        - that Europe is east (not south) of North America. Since the NO is based
        on a directional difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Rather, the NO was given because the
        model argues that the locations are on different continents and thus a north-south
        comparison is not meaningful. The model does not state that the locations
        are at equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result (rejecting the premise that one
        location is south of the other). While the model explains why the comparison
        is problematic, it still provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing to
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating that Europe is east of North America, not south), not on equality
        of values. The model explicitly notes a directional difference between the
        locations, explaining that one is in Europe and one is in North America, with
        Europe being east rather than south of North America.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it both in the conclusion and as a final bolded statement.

        (stating that Europe is east of North America, not south), not on the locations
        being equal. The model explicitly notes they are in different locations (Europe
        vs North America).

        that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it argued that they are
        on different continents and not in north-south alignment, making the comparison
        meaningless. This is a different reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it states NO because the
        Retezat Mountains are east of Parry Sound (not south). The model explicitly
        notes a directional difference between the locations, saying "Europe is generally
        east of North America, not south."

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values being compared are equal/same/identical. Instead, the reason given
        was that the locations are on different continents and "not aligned on a north-south
        axis," making the comparison premise invalid. This is a different type of
        reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it explains that the comparison doesn't make sense due to the locations
        being on different continents, it still provides NO as a definitive comparative
        answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying the Black
        Hills are north of Pettit Lake. The NO is because the relationship is opposite
        to what was asked (north instead of south), not because the locations are
        at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer - that
        Rush Lake is on a different continent and therefore cannot be south of the
        Inyo Mountains. The NO is based on relative positions, not equality of values.

        (Pakistan vs USA) and indicates Rush Lake is "far to the east" of the Inyo
        Mountains. The NO answer is based on directional difference (not being south),
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that Rush Lake is "roughly
        at the same latitude" as the Inyo Mountains, it also states "or slightly south"
        indicating a potential difference. Since it doesn't definitively state they
        are exactly equal and mentions a possible difference, this doesn't qualify
        as a pure equality-based NO answer.

        a clear difference in location (different continents) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because Rush
        Lake was determined to be east of the Inyo Mountains rather than south of
        them. The model explicitly notes a difference in position (east vs. south)
        rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Sand
        Lake is north of Lac Phillipe, not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference (Sand Lake is
        north of Lac Phillipe), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Sand Lake is north of Lac Phillipe and therefore cannot
        be south of it. This is a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Bantry Bay
        is on the northern side of Middle Harbour, indicating a directional difference
        as the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a directional comparison (Bantry Bay is on the northern
        side, not south of Middle Harbour)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it explicitly states that Bantry Bay
        is on the northern side of Middle Harbour, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Bantry
        Bay is not located south of Middle Harbour" as its conclusion. This is a direct
        comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    623a1394-015b-40ad-a8af-943e6dd91fd0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the NO answer was given because
        Bantry Bay was explicitly stated to be "northwest" of Middle Harbour, indicating
        a directional difference. The model did not claim the locations were equal
        or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this is a direct comparative result based on the relative
        positions it analyzed (finding that Bantry Bay is northwest, not south, of
        Middle Harbour).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear directional
        difference (Bantry Bay being on the northern side of Middle Harbour), not
        because the locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there
        is a positional difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the relative
        positions (Bantry Bay being on the northern side of Middle Harbour).

        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that Bantry Bay is
        on the northern side of Middle Harbour, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Final Answer:
        NO" after explaining that Bantry Bay is on the northern side of Middle Harbour,
        not the southern side. This is a direct comparative answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Bantry Bay is "northwest
        of the main body of Middle Harbour". The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Bantry
        Bay is not located south of Middle Harbour" as its conclusion, providing a
