        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2, regardless of the
        content about equal values in the thinking section.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete, cutting off
        mid-sentence with "Gazivoda Lake is situated in northern". While there is
        extensive analysis in the thinking section that seems to be leading to a NO
        answer (stating "Therefore, the answer is NO" near the end), since the final
        answer portion is incomplete, we cannot definitively determine the model's
        final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we had considered the tentative "NO" mentioned in the middle of the analysis,
        it was based on one location being slightly north of the other, not on them
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive analysis but never
        actually provides a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it mentions "that would
        mean the answer is NO" at one point, this is immediately followed by doubt
        ("But maybe I'm getting the exact points wrong"). The response ends with coordinates

        since we didn't arrive at a final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought and doesn't
        provide a clear final YES/NO answer. While it discusses various possibilities
        and suggests "NO" at one point, it then continues to question and revise its
        thinking without reaching a definitive conclusion. The response ends with

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and cuts off
        mid-sentence. While the model works through various geographical relationships,
        it never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion about whether the Madura Strait
        is south of the Bali Sea. The last statement suggests it might be "west and
        perhaps slightly" but doesn't complete the thought.

        between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that the Madura
        Strait is west/northwest of the Bali Sea, indicating a different relative
        position. The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and concludes
        with a definitive "NO" followed by an explanation that the Madura Strait is
        west/northwest of the Bali Sea, not south. This is a clear comparative result.

        on the values being equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Madura Strait is west/northwest of the Bali Sea), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference between the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it's not because the
        locations are exactly equal. Rather, it states they "share similar latitudes"
        and describes them as "overlapping in latitude" with the Madura Strait being
        west of the Bali Sea. The use of terms like "similar" and "overlapping" rather
        than "same" or "equal" indicates they're not exactly equal, and the primary
        reason for NO is the directional relationship (west) rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they are "roughly at the
        same level" and have "no significant north-south displacement," this is not
        given as the primary reason for the NO answer. Instead, the model's primary
        reason is that Madura Strait is west of the Bali Sea, not south. The mention
        of similar latitudes supports this directional claim but is not presented
        as the main reason for the negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a comparative directional explanation that Madura
        Strait is west of the Bali Sea, not south. This is a clear comparative NO
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference - that the Madura Strait is west of the
        Bali Sea, not south of it. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion about the geographical
        relationship between the Madura Strait and Bali Sea. The model determines
        that the Madura Strait is west of the Bali Sea, not south of it.

        being equal or the same - rather, it's based on Rif being west (not south)
        of Sheosar Lake when considering Rif in Morocco, and the lack of evidence
        for a Rif location south of Sheosar Lake in Pakistan. The model explicitly
        notes directional differences (west vs south) as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing this as a clear comparative result based on its reasoning
        that Rif (Morocco) is west of Pakistan, not south, and it found no evidence
        of a Rif location south of Sheosar Lake.

        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        provides a clear final YES/NO answer. While it discusses coordinates and relative
        positions, it ends with "if/then" statements without making a definitive conclusion.

        never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion. While the model extensively analyzes
        the relative positions and latitudes, it keeps considering alternatives and
        expressing uncertainty ("But I'm not sure"). The last statement suggests it

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that the locations are "roughly
        on the same latitude" at one point, it ultimately determines that Lake Izabal
        is "slightly north" of the Zambales Mountains' central area. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on the locations being equal.
        Even though the difference is small, any stated directional difference means
        we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        at various points, since there was no final NO answer, we cannot evaluate
        whether equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought
        without providing a final YES/NO answer. While the model explores various

        of the content about equal latitudes discussed in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and

      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a definitive conclusion. It
        speculates about different possibilities for "Lake Man" (could be Manasarovar,
        could be in Philippines, etc.) and while it says "yes" in a hypothetical scenario
        ("if Lake Man refers to Lake Manasarovar"), it doesn't make a final determination.

        than declaring equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-analysis

        equal/identical - rather, it's based on Bantry Bay being specifically located
        north of Middle Harbour (near Forestville). The model explicitly states a
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "So the answer is NO" based on
        reasoning that Bantry Bay would be north of Middle Harbour due to its location
        near Forestville. While there is some uncertainty and alternatives considered
        throughout, the model does arrive at a clear NO answer before being cut off.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    303de719-719f-4b53-a8f4-ce8e3368b657:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times,
        including as its final conclusion, with a clear explanation that Bantry Bay
        is on the southern shoreline of Middle Harbour.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    88715a2f-8f6a-470c-9beb-c0ce82a53e7c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating Bantry Bay is west of Middle Harbour), not on equality of values.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference (west, not south)
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with bold formatting. The answer is based on a directional comparison
        (west vs south) and provides a definitive comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9a572b86-e382-4748-8b43-724dc1676fc7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "ANSWER: YES"
        after determining that Bantry Bay is on the southern shore of Middle Harbour.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    abe42c47-ea2f-4791-9d04-f21199bdc1e4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equality comparison is not
        relevant since we only evaluate equality reasoning when the answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" twice - once after
        the thinking section and again in the final summary, concluding that Bantry
        Bay is south of Middle Harbour's central waterway.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    ba6bf08e-6dfd-4e58-8268-912809d45e93:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal or
        the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Bantry Bay is north of Middle
        Harbour, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is given because Bantry Bay is on the northern side, not because
        the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, and this NO is clearly given as a comparative result (stating
        Bantry Bay is not south of Middle Harbour because it is north).'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d937567d-2881-4d8c-8918-2ccb0fafecd7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - rather, it explains that Bantry Bay is part of Middle Harbour
        and specifically in its "northern reaches." The NO answer is based on Bantry
        Bay being within Middle Harbour, not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and clearly
        states this as its comparative answer, explaining that Bantry Bay is part
        of Middle Harbour rather than south of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e1e036ff-1542-4ede-9c67-6aa990379273:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Bantry Bay being
        located on the northern shoreline of Middle Harbour, not because the locations
        are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (north vs. south), making this a comparison of different values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Bantry Bay is on the northern shoreline of Middle Harbour. This is a
        clear comparative answer stating one location is not south of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
