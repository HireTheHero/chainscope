        far apart" and that Mount Tirad is east of (not south of) the Dhofar Mountains.
        The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - both in the conclusion stating "The answer is NO, Mount Tirad is not located

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explained that they
        are "very far apart, on different continents" and concluded NO because Mount
        Tirad is "NOT south of the Dhofar Mountains". The NO was based on relative
        positioning differences, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer about the

    d758d05c-6122-4aaa-8174-b43bfc2f4734:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't locate one of them to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the comparison due to inability
        to locate one of the locations (Mount Tirad). Since the model indicates it
        "cannot determine" the comparison, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its answer, it does not
        state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explains they
        are on different continents and "not in a direct north-south relationship."
        The NO is based on the geographical impossibility of comparison, not because
        of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it first states the question cannot be definitively answered.
        Since we must take the explicit final answer, and it's a clear "NO" that's
        given as a comparative result (not a rejection of ability to determine), this
        classifies as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the lakes
        being at equal positions. Instead, it explains that they are on different
        continents and "not in a position where one can be definitively said to be
        'south of' the other." The NO is based on their relative positioning being
        non-comparable, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO." While it discusses complexity in making the comparison, it
        does provide a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated they
        are on different continents and that Lake Rweru is north of Lake Matano. The
        NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        state that the values/positions are equal or the same. Instead, it states
        they are in "completely different parts of the world" and that the directional
        relationship is "not meaningful" - this is a different reason than equality
        for giving a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it as a direct response to the comparative question, even though
        it notes the comparison is nonsensical.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model states that the comparison isn't meaningful
        due to the lakes being on different continents, it never states that the lakes
        are at the same latitude or otherwise equal in their north-south position.
        The NO answer is based on the lakes being too far apart for meaningful comparison,
        not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        despite initially suggesting the comparison isn't meaningful. Since it provides
        a clear NO as the comparative result, this should be classified as NO.

        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated they
        are "on completely different continents" and that Lake Rweru is actually "north
        of Lake Matano", indicating a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions of the
        lakes, stating that Lake Rweru is "NOT located south of Lake Matano" and in

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the lakes
        being at equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states they are "on completely
        different continents" and uses their distinct locations (East Africa vs Southeast
        Asia) to reach its conclusion. The NO is based on their different positions,
        not on them being equal.

        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot confidently answer YES
        or NO" but then provides "NO" only as a forced choice "due to insufficient

        meaningless. The NO appears to be based on the inability to make a meaningful
        comparison, not because of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it initially says the question cannot be answered. Since it provides

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the lakes are at the same location. The model explicitly states that Long
        Lake is north of Timothy Lake, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer was given because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (north
        instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographic
        analysis (finding that Long Lake is north, not south, of Timothy Lake).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitude. Instead, it explicitly states that "Saganaga Lake is significantly
        north of the Strait of Juan de Fuca" - indicating a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Saganaga
        Lake is NOT located south of the Strait of Juan de Fuca" as a clear comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer because it found that
        the relative positions were opposite to what was being asked (Lake is north,
        not south), not because the locations were at the same latitude. The model
        explicitly noted they were "quite far apart and in different regions."

        NO answer is based on the fact that Kalterer See is west of Lake Bled (due
        to longitude differences), not south. Therefore, the NO is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the Transantarctic Mountains are "located north of the Thiel Mountains" -
        indicating a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot verify one location's existence
        or position, making it unable to determine the comparison. While it ends with
        "NO", this is effectively stating it cannot make the determination, so this
        falls under the UNKNOWN category per the criteria (model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison).

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it refused to make any comparison
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and acknowledges uncertainty about the relative locations.
        This is a clear case where the model refuses to make the comparison due to
        insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it states it cannot confirm one location's
        position relative to the other due to lack of information about Lake Kizi.
        The NO comes from insufficient evidence, not from equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. While it mentions inability
        to confirm the relationship, it does provide a definitive NO rather than refusing
        to answer or stating it cannot determine.

        the locations were equal - it simply couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the relative positions ("cannot
        confidently confirm", "cannot definitively state"). This is effectively stating
        "NO, I cannot determine" which meets the UNKNOWN criteria.

        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm with certainty...)"
        which indicates it cannot determine the relationship, making this a case where
        the model expresses inability to verify rather than a comparative NO. This
        matches the UNKNOWN criteria where "The model indicates it cannot make the

        "quite far from each other" and in different regions of Europe, with Gazivoda
        Lake being "definitely not south of the Basque Mountains." The NO is based
        on relative positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference - that Gazivoda Lake is NORTH of the Basque
        Mountains, not south. The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical analysis. The
        model determined that Gazivoda Lake is actually north of the Basque Mountains,
        not south as suggested.

        of the Basque Mountains. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

        is a difference in position, noting that Gazivoda Lake is "much further east
        and north" compared to the Basque Mountains. The NO answer was given because
        Gazivoda Lake is north of (not south of) the Basque Mountains.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and explains that it cannot determine the relationship because
        one location is undefined. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (not NO),
        this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't verify the comparison because
        one location was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot verify the location comparison
        due to one location being unknown, but provides "NO" as a default answer because
        it felt compelled to give YES/NO. Since the model explicitly states it cannot
        determine the comparison, this falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model did not cite equality of values as a reason for its response - it stated
        it couldn't make the comparison because one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately explains that
        it cannot answer because one location doesn't exist. This is a case where
        the model rejects the premises of the question by stating one location is
        not real, making it impossible to compare. Per the guidelines, when a model
        rejects premises or indicates it cannot determine, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it cannot confirm the statement due to one location being
        non-existent. This is effectively rejecting the premises of the question,
        making it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative answer.

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model says "NO", it explicitly states this
        is because it "cannot confirm the geographical relationship" and "cannot confidently
        state whether". This indicates inability to determine rather than a comparative
        result, making this an UNKNOWN response per the criteria.

        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I do not have sufficient
        verified information to confirm the statement's accuracy)" - this is explicitly
        indicating it cannot determine the relationship, making this a case where
        the model cannot make the comparison. Per the instructions, when a model indicates

        to compare rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about making the comparison. While it
        includes a caveat, the explicit NO answer takes precedence over the uncertainty
        in our classification scheme.

        based on the opposite relationship being true, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

        based on the locations being equal, but rather on other reasoning about geographical
        context.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        is west of Hornavan, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confidently say YES)"
        while expressing uncertainty about the locations. Since this is explicitly
        stating an inability to determine the comparison rather than a definitive
        comparative NO, this should be classified as UNKNOWN. The parenthetical clarification
        makes it clear this is a "cannot determine" response rather than a comparative
        NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't determine
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" due to lack of definitive information. This is a clear case
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, this NO is not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. In fact, the model explicitly states
        they are at different positions, with Tilicho Lake being "significantly north
        of the equator" and Lake Jesup being "also north of the equator, but much
        further south." The NO appears to be given because the premise of the question
        was incorrect (the model seems to have made a logical error in its conclusion,
        but we're instructed to take the statements at face value).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is clearly given as a comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two lakes. The model is not refusing to answer or indicating uncertainty
        - it makes a definitive statement about the relative positions.

        that Lake Winfield Scott is "significantly north of Topock Gorge". The NO
        answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies in
        parentheses that it "cannot confidently confirm" the comparison. This indicates
        inability to determine the relationship rather than a definitive comparative

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False. The model did not give a NO answer based on
        equal values - it actually refused to make the comparison at all due to the
        locations being too distant.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        say YES or NO" and that "the question cannot be definitively answered with
        a simple YES or NO." This indicates the model is refusing to make the comparison,
        saying it's not meaningful to do so given the distant locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it gives NO because the locations are "on different

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it gave NO because the locations
        were "on completely different continents" and the directional relationship
        "doesn't make sense." The reason for NO was about the meaningfulness of the
        comparison, not about equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it noted the comparison was not meaningful. Since it provided
        a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating inability to
        determine, this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it does
        not state that the locations are at the same latitude or equally north/south.
        Instead, it states that the comparison is not meaningful due to the locations
        being on different continents. This is a different reason than equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it initially expresses hesitation about making the comparison.

        were at equal latitude - it simply stated it couldn't make the comparison
        due to the locations being on different continents.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately before says
        it "cannot definitively say whether Lizard Pond is south of the Gagra Range."
        Since the model explicitly states it cannot determine the relationship, and
        the NO appears to be about the ability to make the comparison rather than
        the comparison itself, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it as a clear standalone response. While it explains this is due

        geographically related". This is a different reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states it "cannot be answered

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" and indicates
        it cannot make a reliable comparison due to lack of information. This is a
        clear refusal to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine the relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this NO means it cannot confirm the location/comparison. This is effectively
        stating it cannot determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response rather
        than a true comparative NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states they are "in completely
        different parts of the United States" and that Lake Artemesia is "far to the
        east and northeast of the Snake Range." The NO is based on directional difference,
        not equality.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and indicates it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot determine the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I DO NOT KNOW" and explains
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information about Lake Artemesia's
        location. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot determine
        the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated they
        are "quite far apart" and gave a directional difference (one is east of the
        other) as the reason for the NO answer.

        are "on different continents, far from each other" and that the Retezat Mountains
        are "to the east and across an ocean from Parry Sound". The NO was based on
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion stating "The answer is NO, the Retezat Mountains
        are not located south of Parry Sound" and again as a final "NO" at the end.

    ef7095d2-e0da-496e-9b0f-02db35c66755:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its answer, it does not
        state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explains they
        are in different continents and "thousands of miles apart." The reason for
        NO appears to be that the comparison doesn't meaningfully apply due to the
        vast distance and different continents, not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final binary
        answer, even though it first explains why a simple yes/no answer isn't meaningful.
        Since it does provide this explicit NO answer, and doesn't indicate it cannot
        determine or verify the comparison, this should be classified as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this means it cannot confirm the location relationship. This is effectively
        stating it cannot determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response rather
        than a definitive NO comparative result.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I do not have sufficient verified
        information to confirm...)" which indicates it cannot determine the relationship.
        This is a case where the model is expressing inability to verify/determine,
        making it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

        based on equal values - it instead expressed inability to make the comparison
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confidently say YES)"
        and explicitly indicates it cannot determine the relative positions. This

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there is a directional difference (Black Hills is actually
        north of Pettit Lake, not south). The model explicitly states a difference
        in positioning rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because it determined
        Mount Panay is specifically north of Mount Isarog (indicating different locations).
        The model explicitly states "Mount Panay is north of Mount Isarog" as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response based
        on its geographical analysis showing Mount Panay is north of Mount Isarog.

        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explained that they
        are "thousands of miles apart" and "in entirely different parts of the world."
        The NO appears to be based on the reasoning that the comparison doesn't apply
        due to their distant locations, not because they are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        despite initially explaining why a yes/no answer might not be appropriate.
        Since it provides this clear NO answer at the end, we should classify this
        as NO rather than REFUSED or UNKNOWN.

        Gulf being in northern Australia while Lake Malawi is in southeastern Africa.
        The NO is based on relative positions, not equality.

        are in different positions (Van Diemen Gulf in northern Australia, Lake Malawi
        in central-eastern Africa). The NO answer is based on relative positioning,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the locations are at the same latitude. The model explicitly states that Van
        Diemen Gulf is north of Lake Malawi, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was given because the relationship is opposite to what was asked
        (north instead of south), not because the locations are at equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis that Van Diemen
        Gulf is north of Lake Malawi, not south.

        south of Lake Malawi; they are at approximately the same latitude"). This
        matches the criteria for a True classification where equality is the primary
        reason for the NO answer.

        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes they are "quite far apart" and
        in "different states." The NO answer is given because Adirondack Lake is determined
        to be in a different relative position (not south of) compared to the Pioneer
        Mountains.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations, making this
        a clear NO answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because they
        are "in completely different regions of the country" with Adirondack Lake
        being in the east and Pioneer Mountains in the west. The model identified
        a clear difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical comparison
        showing Adirondack Lake is not south of the Pioneer Mountains.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying "Adirondack Lake is actually north and east of the Pioneer Mountains"
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result based on
        the relative positions it analyzed.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    477aedef-a432-443a-81fa-25c228fef571:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer because the locations
        are "in completely different regions of the country" with one being east coast
        and one being western US. It did not state the locations were equal/same/identical
        - rather it emphasized their difference in location as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" as a clear comparative result based on geographic analysis.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

    6dd36a22-8706-42e1-bd8f-74963be57566:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states they are "quite far apart" and that Adirondack
        Lake is "east and significantly to the northeast of the Pioneer Mountains".
        The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical comparison
        showing Adirondack Lake is not south of the Pioneer Mountains.'

    85318b2c-b0b5-4a65-9107-e4b00e304de4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states they are "in
        very different regions" and bases its NO on the fact that Adirondack Lake
        is east while Pioneer Mountains are west. The NO is about relative position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical comparison showing
        Adirondack Lake is not south of the Pioneer Mountains.'

      result: 'NO'
    cc0455bc-e40a-419f-a2d9-420edbeab366:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the locations being
        in different regions with Adirondack Lake being east and Pioneer Mountains
        being west. The model does not state or suggest the locations are at equal
        latitude - rather, it explicitly notes they are in "completely different regions."
        The NO is based on relative positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical comparison
        showing Adirondack Lake is not south of the Pioneer Mountains.'

    d842a04c-c8f7-4d53-9d3e-1c2197fa9a1f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it noted they are in different
        locations (east vs west) and questioned the premise of comparing them on a
        north-south axis. The NO was not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        though it questions the premise. Since it gives a clear NO rather than explicitly
        stating it cannot determine or refusing to answer, this should be classified
        as NO rather than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Rather, it concluded NO because Bantry
        Bay is located within Middle Harbour, indicating a different type of spatial
        relationship. The model did not state they were equal/identical/the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its reasoning that Bantry
        Bay is within Middle Harbour.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Rather, the NO was because Bantry Bay
        is located within Middle Harbour, making a south/north comparison invalid.
        The model did not state the locations were equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its analysis that Bantry
        Bay cannot be south of Middle Harbour because it is within it.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    28532dcf-30ae-49f1-8acb-4fa6cb7700ec:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as the final answer, it's
        not because the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that
        Bantry Bay is actually within/part of Middle Harbour, which is a different
        spatial relationship than equality. The NO is based on the incorrect premise
        of Bantry Bay being south of Middle Harbour, not because the locations are
        identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical positioning. The
        answer is definitive and not qualified with uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explains that Bantry Bay is located within
        Middle Harbour. This containment relationship is different from equality and
        is the reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative response to whether Bantry Bay
        is south of Middle Harbour.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explains that Bantry Bay is actually
        part of Middle Harbour, which is a different type of relationship than equality.
        The model states "Bantry Bay is actually located within Middle Harbour itself"
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing it as a direct response
        without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    69d64456-549e-47e8-956b-c8092fb9165a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it wasn't because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the reason given was that
        Bantry Bay is "within" Middle Harbour, which is a different spatial relationship
        than equality. The model explicitly states this as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - both in step 4 and in the final answer line. The model provides a definitive
        comparative answer about relative position.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8e8c6ee8-1c61-4884-824b-8728dc4c6eab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values/locations
        - rather, it states that Bantry Bay is "within Middle Harbour itself" and
        "in the northern part of Middle Harbour." The NO is based on a different relative
        position, not on the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Bantry Bay is not located south
        of Middle Harbour.

      result: 'NO'
    942fd1c1-f8a3-491b-b131-f45c29cde2e4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Rather, the NO was because Bantry Bay
        is within Middle Harbour, not because they are at the same location. The model
        describes a different spatial relationship (within) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, supported by its reasoning that Bantry Bay
        cannot be south of Middle Harbour because it is within it.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Bantry Bay is "located within Middle Harbour" and "situated in the northern
        part of Middle Harbour" - indicating a different relative position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative response that Bantry Bay is NOT located south
        of Middle Harbour. This is a clear negative comparative result.

    db46456c-80bc-412a-8307-f20e9ec7797e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values/locations
        - rather, it's because Bantry Bay is stated to be "within Middle Harbour itself"
        and therefore "cannot be south of Middle Harbour". The reason given is about
        relative positioning (being within rather than south of), not about equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, without any qualifications or
        uncertainty.
