      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "Cinema Veeran has a longer total runtime
        than I Hope They Serve Beer In Hell," indicating a difference in values. The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Cinema Veeran has
        a longer total runtime than I Hope They Serve Beer In Hell." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the runtimes are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "I Hope They Serve Beer In
        Hell has a shorter total runtime than Cinema Veeran" which indicates a difference
        in values. The model is not saying NO because the values are equal, but rather
        because it believes one runtime is shorter than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is inconsistent, alternating
        between "Yes" and "No" answers to the same question. However, the most frequent
        and final answers are "No, I Hope They Serve Beer In Hell has a shorter total
        runtime than Cinema Veeran." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
