      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was classified as UNKNOWN, not NO.
        According to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, the answer
        to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer the question because
        I don't have access to the runtimes of these movies." This indicates the model
        cannot make the comparison due to lack of information, which falls under the
        UNKNOWN category.

        about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it outlined steps to solve the problem and asked
        for more information about the runtimes of both films. The model explicitly
        states "Can you provide me with the runtimes of both films? If so, I can help
        you determine if Insaf Ki Pukar has a shorter runtime." This indicates the
        model cannot make the comparison without additional information.

        needed to make the comparison (runtimes of both movies) and then states it
        cannot provide this information without access to reliable sources. This is
        a case where the model indicates it cannot make the determination due to lack

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it asks for more information about the
        runtimes of both movies and explains the steps needed to make the comparison,

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it outlines steps to solve the problem
        but then states it cannot provide the information needed ("I can't give you
        the exact runtimes of these movies as I don't have access to real-time information").
        The model effectively indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack

        model didn't give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a
        NO answer because the values are the same doesn't apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Without knowing the runtimes, I
        cannot answer the question." It doesn't provide a definitive YES or NO answer,
        but instead indicates it lacks the information needed to make the comparison.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model explicitly states it

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model didn't give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlines steps to find the information
        needed to make the comparison (looking up runtimes and comparing them) but
        doesn't actually make the comparison itself. The model indicates it cannot
        determine the answer without additional information about the runtimes.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but UNKNOWN, according
        to the instructions, I should put False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Without the runtime information
        for these films, I cannot answer the question." This indicates the model cannot
        make the comparison due to lack of information, which falls under the UNKNOWN
        category.

        the model indicated it couldn't determine the answer due to lack of information

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Since I don't have the
        runtime information for these movies, I can't answer the question with a YES
        or NO." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of
        information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it outlines steps to determine the answer (find
        runtimes and compare them) and then asks for the runtimes to help make the
        determination. Since no definitive comparative conclusion is reached, this
        is classified as UNKNOWN.

        answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it only outlined steps for how one would
        determine the answer, without actually providing the answer itself. The model
        did not refuse to answer, but rather failed to give a clear comparative result

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't answer your question
        with a YES or NO" because it doesn't have access to the specific movie data
        needed to make the comparison. It acknowledges its inability to determine
        the answer due to lack of information.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it asks for more information about the
        runtimes of the movies in order to make a determination. The model states

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather UNKNOWN. The
        model did not make a determination about whether the values are equal or not,
        as it stated it couldn't answer without knowing the runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Without knowing the runtimes,
        I can't give you a YES or NO answer." This indicates the model cannot make
        the comparison due to lack of information, which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        and not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions:

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I can't answer the question without
        knowing the runtimes of both movies." This indicates the model is refusing
        to provide a definitive YES or NO answer due to lack of information. The model
        acknowledges it cannot make the comparison without specific data.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a step-by-step approach to answer
        the question but does not actually provide a definitive YES or NO answer.
        It merely outlines how one would go about determining the answer, suggesting
        the user look up the runtimes and compare them. The model ends by offering
        help finding the runtimes but never states a conclusion.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't answer your question
        with a YES or NO" because it lacks information about the runtimes of the movies.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it outlines steps to find the answer
        but states "I can't give you the exact runtimes of these movies as I don't
