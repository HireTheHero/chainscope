      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it outlined steps to solve the problem and indicated
        what the answer would be under different conditions ("If the runtime of 'Parullat'
        is shorter... then the answer is YES. If... longer, then the answer is NO."),

        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlines a process for how to approach
        the question, asking for runtime information to make the comparison, but doesn't
        actually make the comparison itself. The response ends with "Let me know if

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a YES or NO answer to the
        comparison. Instead, it requested additional information (runtime of both
        movies) that it would need to make the comparison. This indicates the model
        cannot make the determination with the information available.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the comparison at all due to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" but it immediately
        clarifies in parentheses that "We can't answer this question with the information
        given." This indicates the model is not making a comparative judgment but
        rather stating it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating it cannot
        make the comparison without the necessary runtime information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states that it needs access to runtime
        information for both movies to make the comparison. The model outlines steps
        to find the answer but doesn't actually provide a conclusion. This is a case
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison without additional
        information.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "We don't have enough information to determine if the runtime
        of 'Insaaf Main Karoongaa' is shorter than 'Playdate with Destiny'." This
        indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. It only outlines steps to solve the problem (find runtimes,
        compare them) and asks if the user has the runtime information. Since there
        is no explicit comparative conclusion, this is classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN
        (the model couldn't determine the answer due to lack of information), this
        question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer to the comparison. Instead, it states "I can't access real-time information,
        including movie runtime data. So I can't give you a definitive answer." This

        this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it outlined steps to solve the problem and ended
        with a question asking if the runtime information is available. The model
        did not make a determination or refuse to answer - it simply didn't complete
        the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it explains the steps needed to find
        the answer but states it cannot access the information needed to make the
        determination. The model explicitly says "I can't give you the exact runtimes"
        and suggests the user would need to find this information themselves.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer to the comparison. Instead, it states that it cannot access real-time
        information like movie runtime and asks the user to provide the runtimes so
        it can help determine the answer. This indicates the model cannot make the

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the second question about whether the model gave a NO answer because
        the values are the same is not applicable. According to the instructions,
        if the final answer was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states that it cannot answer the question
        because it doesn't have access to the runtime information for both films.
        The model explains that it lacks the necessary data in its knowledge base
        to make the comparison and suggests external sources where this information
        could be found. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the
        comparison due to insufficient information.
