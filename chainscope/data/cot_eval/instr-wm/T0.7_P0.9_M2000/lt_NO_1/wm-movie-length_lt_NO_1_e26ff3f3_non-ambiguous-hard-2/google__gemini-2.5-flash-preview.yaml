      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Within the Woods (30 minutes) is significantly shorter than Parullat
        (90-95 minutes), which is the opposite of what was asked. The model explicitly
        states "30 minutes is significantly shorter than 90-95 minutes" and concludes
        that "Parullat does not have a shorter runtime."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Parullat has a shorter runtime than Within the Woods. The model
        explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining that Within the Woods (30
        minutes) is shorter than Parullat (90-95 minutes).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the runtimes are different (145
        minutes vs. 96 minutes) and that Fighter is longer than Winter Cherry. The
        NO answer is given because Fighter is longer than Winter Cherry, not because
        they have equal runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Fighter is not
        shorter than Winter Cherry because Fighter has a runtime of 145 minutes while
        Winter Cherry has a runtime of 96 minutes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Fighter's
        runtime (150 minutes) is longer than Winter Cherry's runtime (92 minutes),
        not because the values are equal. The model explicitly states "150 minutes
        is not shorter than 92 minutes; it is longer." This indicates a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "Ravi Kinagi's 'Fighter' does not have a shorter total runtime
        than Igor Maslennikov's 'Winter Cherry'" after comparing the runtimes (150
        minutes vs 92 minutes).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Fighter
        (140 minutes) is longer than Winter Cherry (96 minutes), not because the values
        are equal. The model explicitly states "Is 140 minutes shorter than 96 minutes?
        No. 140 is longer than 96."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Final Answer based on
        the comparison is NO" after determining that Fighter (140 minutes) does not
        have a shorter runtime than Winter Cherry (96 minutes).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that 145 minutes is greater than 95 minutes
        ("145 is not shorter than 95"). The model's NO answer is based on the fact
        that Fighter's runtime (145 minutes) is longer than Winter Cherry's runtime
        (95 minutes), not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        In the last part of its response, it explicitly concludes "Comparing 145 minutes
        and 95 minutes, 145 is not shorter than 95. NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        values being compared are different, not the same. Specifically, it states
        that Fighter has a runtime of 145 minutes while Winter Cherry has a runtime
        of 90 minutes, and concludes that "145 minutes is longer than 90 minutes."
        The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes with "Therefore, the reasoning leads directly to the NO answer.
        NO" after comparing the runtimes of the two movies and determining that Fighter
        (145 minutes) is longer than Winter Cherry (90 minutes).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that Fighter (148 minutes) is longer
        than Winter Cherry (96 minutes), which is the reason for its NO answer. The
        model is comparing different values (148 vs 96 minutes) and concluding that
        one is longer than the other, not that they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes of the two movies and determining that Fighter
        (148 minutes) is not shorter than Winter Cherry (96 minutes).

        Instead, it explicitly states that Fighter (140 minutes) is longer than Winter
        Cherry (97 minutes), which is why it answers NO to the question of whether
        Fighter has a shorter runtime than Winter Cherry. The model clearly identifies
        a difference in values.

        minutes) is longer than Pippi Longstocking (100 minutes). The NO answer is
        given because the comparison in the question is reversed from the actual relationship
        (asking if the longer movie is shorter).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        100 minutes" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It compares the runtimes of the two movies (151 minutes for Manithan Maravillai

        runtime is longer than Hamilton's (not equal to it).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly says "No, Stone (103 mins) does not have a shorter runtime than

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly compares the runtimes of the two films (150 minutes vs 6

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes that 113 minutes is longer than 45 minutes, and
        therefore "113 is not shorter than 45." The model is giving a NO answer because
        one value is larger than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        and also says "No, 113 is not shorter than 45" in step 7. This is a definitive
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly compares the runtimes (113 minutes vs 85
        minutes) and determines that the first movie's runtime is longer than the
        second movie's runtime. The model states "The comparison (113 < 85) is false"
        which indicates the values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model also states "Therefore, 'Don't Say a Word' does *not* have a shorter
        total runtime than 'Alien Adventure'." which confirms the NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that the runtimes are different (153 minutes
        vs 92 minutes) and concludes "No. 153 is greater than 92." The NO answer is
        given because one value is greater than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It clearly compares the runtimes of the two films (153 minutes vs 92 minutes)
        and concludes that Mr. Sampati does not have a shorter runtime than Kanto
        Wanderer.

        92 minutes" and concluded "No, 140 minutes is not shorter than 92 minutes."
        The model clearly identified a difference between the runtimes (140 vs 92
        minutes) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. This is a clear comparative result where
        the model determined that Mr. Sampati does not have a shorter total runtime
        than Kanto Wanderer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Mr. Sampati (158 minutes) is
        longer than Kanto Wanderer (92 minutes). The model says "NO" because it found
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - Mr. Sampati is longer,
        not shorter than Kanto Wanderer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. It explicitly concludes that "the answer
        to 'Does S. S. Vasan's Mr. Sampati have a shorter total runtime than Seijun
        Suzuki's Kanto Wanderer?' is NO."

        In fact, it explicitly notes that the runtimes are different (131 minutes
        vs. 92 minutes) and states that "131 minutes is longer than 92 minutes." The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "Since *Mr. Sampati*'s runtime (131 mins) is *not* shorter
        than *Kanto Wanderer*'s runtime (92 mins), the answer to the question... is
        NO." The model provides a clear comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Mr. Sampati's runtime (135 minutes) is
        longer than Kanto Wanderer's runtime (92 minutes). The model says "No, 135
        minutes is *longer* than 92 minutes" and "135 minutes is not shorter than
        92 minutes; it is longer." The NO answer is based on a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The final answer is therefore
        NO" and reiterates "NO" at the very end of its response. The model directly
        answers the comparative question with a definitive negative.

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that Mr. Sampati has a runtime of
        174 minutes while Kanto Wanderer has a runtime of 92 minutes, and concludes
        that Mr. Sampati is longer, not shorter. The NO answer is based on a clear
        difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It clearly compares the runtimes of the two movies (174 minutes vs. 92 minutes)

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        Additionally, the model did not claim the values were equal - it actually
        stated that one runtime (145 minutes) is longer than the other (92 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model worked through a step-by-step comparison
        of the runtimes of the two movies, concluding that "Mr. Sampati does not have
        a shorter runtime than Kanto Wanderer" and stating "Therefore, the answer
        to the question... is NO." The model clearly intended to give a NO answer,
        but the response appears to be cut off before the final answer is explicitly
        stated. Since the model clearly indicated its intention to answer NO but didn't
        explicitly state just "NO" at the end, this falls under UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly identifies that Mr. Sampati has a runtime of
        128 minutes while Kanto Wanderer has a runtime of 92 minutes, and concludes
        that 128 is not shorter than 92. The NO answer is based on a comparison showing
        different values, not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after determining that Mr. Sampati (128 minutes) is not shorter than
        Kanto Wanderer (92 minutes).

        Instead, it explicitly notes that Mr. Sampati has a runtime of 140 minutes
        while Kanto Wanderer has a runtime of 92 minutes. The model's reasoning for
        the NO answer is that 140 minutes is not shorter than 92 minutes (implying
        it's longer), not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 6 and reiterates it at the end of the response. The model directly
        answers the comparative question with a definitive NO.

        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It compares the runtimes of the two movies (135 minutes for Mr. Sampati vs

        to, 100 minutes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" multiple
        times in its response. It compares the runtimes (145 minutes for Dhum Dhadaka
        vs 100 minutes for Family Life) and concludes that since 145 minutes is not

        is longer than the other, not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Does Mahesh Amber Kothare's Dhum Dhadaka have a shorter total
        runtime than Jacques Doillon's Family Life?" The model provides a step-by-step

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The final answer is NO"
        and reiterates "NO" at the very end of its response. The model clearly provides
        a comparative result, determining that Sherman's March does not have a shorter
        runtime than Yolki because Sherman's March (155 minutes) is longer than Yolki
        (109 minutes).

        Instead, it clearly indicates that Sherman's March has a runtime of 155 minutes
        while Yolki 6 has a runtime of 84 minutes, and concludes that "155 is not
        shorter than 84." The NO answer is based on Sherman's March having a longer
        (not equal) runtime.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not provide a clear final NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is cut off before it provides
        a final explicit YES/NO answer. While the model seems to be leaning toward
        a NO answer in its reasoning (saying "Therefore, the answer to the question...
        is NO"), it never actually gives a clear final answer. The model spends most
        of its response explaining that the premise is flawed because "Ignas Jonynas's
        Yolki" doesn't exist, making the comparison impossible. Without a clear final
        YES/NO statement, this falls into the UNKNOWN category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are equal. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines
        that one of the films (Ignas Jonynas's Yolki) doesn't exist, making the runtime
        undefined and the comparison impossible. The model explicitly states "A comparison
        to a non-existent entity with an undefined property (runtime) cannot yield
        a definite result" and concludes that the statement cannot be true. This is
        not based on equality of runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that the statement "Ross McElwee's Sherman's March has
        a shorter total runtime than Ignas Jonynas's Yolki" cannot be true because
        the second film doesn't exist, and therefore answers "NO" to the question.

        are equal. Instead, it gives NO because one of the films in the comparison
        ("Maurice Noble's Transylvania 6-5000") doesn't exist. The model actually
        notes that if comparing just the films by title (ignoring directors), the
        runtimes would be 81 minutes vs 93 minutes, which are different values. The
        NO answer is based on the premise being false, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that the comparison cannot be made because "Maurice Noble's
        Transylvania 6-5000" does not exist, and therefore the statement must be false.
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        Instead, it explicitly states that "88 is greater than 70" and "Rustlers'
        Rhapsody (88 minutes) is NOT shorter than Supertwink (70 minutes)." The NO
        answer is based on the fact that one value is greater than the other, not

        in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes of the two movies. The model determined that

        the first movie is actually longer than the second movie, not because they
        have equal runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after determining that "88 minutes is not shorter than 60 minutes."

        Instead, it explicitly notes that Rustlers' Rhapsody is ~88 minutes while
        Supertwink is around 60-75 minutes. The NO answer is given because Rustlers'
        Rhapsody is longer (not shorter) than Supertwink, not because they have equal
        runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Rustlers' Rhapsody has a shorter runtime than Supertwink.

        In fact, it explicitly states that Alli Arjuna has a runtime of ~150 minutes
        while Kronk's New Groove has a runtime of ~72 minutes, and concludes that
        Alli Arjuna's runtime is longer, not equal. The NO answer is based on the
        fact that one runtime is longer than the other, not that they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion and answer sections. It clearly compares the runtimes of
        the two movies and determines that Alli Arjuna does not have a shorter runtime
        than Kronk's New Groove.

        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        that V.I.P. has a longer runtime (153 minutes) than Pirates of the 20th Century
        (92 minutes), which is the opposite of what was asked in the question. The
        model explicitly states "No, 153 is significantly longer than 92" and "The
        comparison shows V.I.P. has a longer runtime."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        has a longer runtime (153 minutes) than Pirates of the 20th Century (92 minutes),
        and therefore answers "NO" to the question of whether V.I.P. has a shorter

        The model explicitly states "No, 150 is longer than 93" and "Since 150 minutes

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found that Mera Rakshak's
        runtime (154 minutes) is longer than Dr. Plonk's runtime (80 minutes), not
        shorter. The model explicitly states "154 is not shorter than 80" as the reason
        for its NO answer. The values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after determining that Mera Rakshak (154 minutes) does not have a shorter
        runtime than Dr. Plonk (80 minutes). The answer is explicitly stated.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that 106 minutes is greater than (not shorter than) 7 minutes. The model explicitly
        states "106 is not shorter than 7" as its reasoning, indicating a clear difference
        in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after determining that 106 minutes (Stella's runtime) is not shorter than
        7 minutes (Cat Feud's runtime). This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that one runtime is 106 minutes and
        the other is 7 minutes, which are clearly different values. The NO answer
        is given because the first movie's runtime (106 minutes) is not shorter than
        the second movie's runtime (7 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after determining that 106 minutes is not less than 7 minutes. This is an

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "106 minutes is significantly
        longer than 7 minutes." The NO answer is given because the first movie (Stella)
        is longer than the second movie (Cat Feud), not because they have equal runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. It directly answers the comparative question
        with a definitive "NO" after explaining that Stella (106 minutes) is not shorter
        than Cat Feud (7 minutes).

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that 106 minutes (Stella) is not shorter
        than 7 minutes (Cat Feud). The model is comparing different values (106 minutes
        vs. 7 minutes) and determining that the first is not shorter than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after determining that "106 minutes is not shorter than 7 minutes." This is

        while Cat Feud has a runtime of 7 minutes, and concludes that "7 minutes is
        shorter than 106 minutes." The NO answer is given because Stella's runtime
        is longer than Cat Feud's, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. This is a clear comparative result where

        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Does Stella have a shorter total runtime than Cat Feud?"
        The model clearly makes a comparative judgment, determining that Stella (109
        minutes) is not shorter than Cat Feud (7 minutes).

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that Stella has a runtime of approximately
        95 minutes while Cat Feud has a runtime of approximately 7 minutes. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer is that "95 minutes is not shorter than 7 minutes"
        - indicating a clear difference between the values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        the values are equal - in fact, the model explicitly states different values
        (106 minutes vs 7 minutes) and determines that one is longer than the other.
        The NO answer is based on the comparison showing inequality, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        longer than the other (7-8 minutes), and this inequality is the reason for
        the NO answer. The model is saying NO because The Best Man is longer than
        Feline Frame-Up, not because they have equal runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, after determining that 102 minutes (The Best Man) is not shorter
        than 7-8 minutes (Feline Frame-Up). This is a clear negative answer to the

        that the first movie (Insaaf Ki Devi) has a longer runtime (140 minutes) than
        the second movie (Black Emanuelle 2, 93 minutes). The model explicitly states
        "140 minutes is not shorter than 93 minutes" as the reason for its NO answer,
        indicating a difference in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly indicates that S.A. Chandrasekhar's
        Insaaf Ki Devi does not have a shorter total runtime than Bitto Albertini's
        Black Emanuelle 2, concluding with "The answer is no, because 140 minutes

        the second runtime (7 minutes). The model's NO answer is based on the first
        runtime being longer than the second, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The final answer is therefore
        NO" and reiterates "NO" at the very end of its response. The model clearly
        concludes that the runtime of "A Gala Christmas in Vienna / Christmas in Vienna

        while Elvis Has Left the Building has a runtime of 90 minutes, and concludes
        that 144 minutes is longer than 90 minutes (not equal). The NO answer is based
        on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        between the runtimes (104 minutes vs. 7 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after comparing the runtimes of the two films and determining that Come Dance

        This is not because the values are equal, but because the first movie is actually
        longer than the second movie. The model explicitly states "103 minutes is
        not shorter than 7 minutes" as its reasoning.

        Room and Bird." The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

        Instead, it explicitly states that "Come Dance with Me!" has a runtime of
        approximately 91 minutes while "Room and Bird" has a runtime of approximately
        7 minutes. The model concludes NO because 91 minutes is longer than (not equal

        concludes that "Come Dance with Me!" has a longer runtime than "Room and Bird".
        The NO answer is given because the first movie has a longer (not equal) runtime
        than the second movie.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 9 and reiterates it at the end of its response. The model is making
        a direct comparison between the runtimes of the two movies and concluding

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        values being compared are different, not because they are the same. Specifically,
        it stated that "Bas Itna Sa Khwaab Hai" has a runtime of approximately 148
        minutes while "Last Plane Out" has a runtime of approximately 97 minutes.
        The model explicitly states "Is 148 minutes shorter than 97 minutes? No. 148
        is longer than 97." This indicates the values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes with "Okay, I am ready to give the answer. NO" after comparing
        the runtimes of the two movies and determining that "Bas Itna Sa Khwaab Hai"

        that the values are different, with "Last Plane Out" having a shorter runtime
        (93 minutes) than "Bas Itna Sa Khwaab Hai" (146 minutes). The model explicitly
        states "93 minutes is shorter than 146 minutes" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that "Bas Itna Sa Khwaab

        the comparison in the original question is reversed from what the model found
        to be true - the question asked if the first movie was shorter, but the model
        found it was actually longer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
