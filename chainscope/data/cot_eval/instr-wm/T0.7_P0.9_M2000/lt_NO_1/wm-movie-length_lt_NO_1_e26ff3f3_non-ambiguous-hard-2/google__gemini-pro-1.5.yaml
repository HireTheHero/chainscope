        "Parullat has a longer runtime than Within the Woods." The NO answer appears
        to be in response to the original question (likely asking if Within the Woods
        is longer than Parullat).'
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        minutes (Within the Woods)" showing the values are different. The model gives
        a "NO" answer despite noting this inequality, which suggests the "NO" is not
        based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly calculated that Parullat's runtime (82 minutes)
        is greater than Within the Woods' runtime (30 minutes). The model stated "*Parullat*
        has a *longer* runtime than *Within the Woods*" before giving its contradictory
        "NO" answer. Since the model clearly identified a difference in values rather
        than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. However, this contradicts its own reasoning where it concluded "*Parullat*
        has a *longer* runtime than *Within the Woods*" after comparing 82 minutes
        > 30 minutes. This inconsistency creates confusion, but since the final explicit
        answer was "NO", I'll classify it as NO.

        not state that the values being compared are equal. In fact, the model explicitly
        calculated that Parullat has a runtime of 82 minutes while Within the Woods
        has a runtime of 32 minutes, and stated "82 minutes (Parullat) > 32 minutes
        (Within the Woods)". The model concluded that "Parullat has a longer runtime
        than Within the Woods" before stating "NO". The values are clearly not equal
        in the model's analysis.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. This appears to be the final answer, though it contradicts the model's
        own reasoning which concluded that "Parullat has a longer runtime than Within
        the Woods." Despite this contradiction, I must take the explicit "NO" as the
        model's final answer.

        In fact, it explicitly states that "Parullat has a longer runtime than Within

        contradict the comparison the model itself made, but I'm only evaluating what
        was stated, not resolving contradictions.

        82 minutes while Within the Woods has a runtime of 32 minutes, and even stated
        "82 minutes (Parullat) > 32 minutes (Within the Woods)". The model concluded
        that "Parullat has a longer runtime than Within the Woods" before giving its
        contradictory "NO" answer. Since the model clearly identified different values
        and did not claim they were equal, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. However, this contradicts its own reasoning where it concluded "Therefore,
        Parullat has a longer runtime than Within the Woods." The model clearly determined
        that Parullat (82 minutes) has a longer runtime than Within the Woods (32
        minutes), but then gave "NO" as its final answer. Despite this contradiction,
        I must classify based on the explicit final answer, which was "NO".

        runtimes are different (136 minutes vs. 103 minutes) and concludes that "Gumrah
        has a longer runtime than Last Holiday." The model identifies a clear difference
        between the values, not equality. The "NO" answer appears to contradict the
        model's own analysis, but I'm only evaluating what was stated, not resolving
        contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response.
        This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the comparative question. The model
        first explains that Gumrah (1993) has a runtime of 136 minutes while Last
        Holiday (1950) has a runtime of 103 minutes, concludes that "Gumrah has a
        longer runtime than Last Holiday," and then gives "NO" as its final answer.

        In fact, it explicitly states that Gumrah has a longer runtime (136 minutes)
        than Last Holiday (93 minutes), showing they are different values. The model
        concludes "Gumrah has a longer runtime than Last Holiday" before giving its
        NO answer. This indicates the NO is based on a difference in values, not equality.

        minutes while Last Holiday has a runtime of 98 minutes, and concluded that
        "Gumrah has a longer runtime than Last Holiday." The NO answer appears to
        be in response to a question asking if Last Holiday is longer than Gumrah
        (though we don't see the original question). The model is not saying NO because
        the values are equal, but because one is longer than the other.

        are equal. In fact, the model explicitly states that Gumrah is 141 minutes
        while Last Holiday is 93 minutes, and shows the comparison as "141 minutes
        (Gumrah) > 93 minutes (Last Holiday)". The NO answer is because Gumrah is
        longer than Last Holiday, not because they have equal runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Is Gumrah shorter than
        Last Holiday? NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
        The model has determined that Gumrah (141 minutes) is not shorter than Last
        Holiday (93 minutes).

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that "Lady Caroline Lamb" has a runtime
        of 120 minutes while "Guided Mouse-ille" has a runtime of 7 minutes, and concludes
        that "Lady Caroline Lamb has a longer runtime." The NO answer is given because
        the films have different runtimes, not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. In fact, the model explicitly states that the runtimes are different
        (127 minutes vs 7 minutes) and concludes that "Lady Caroline Lamb has a longer
        runtime." The NO answer appears to be in response to a question about whether
        "Guided Mouse-ille" has a longer runtime than "Lady Caroline Lamb" (though
        we don't see the original question).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes of the two films. The model determined that "Lady

        Instead, it explicitly notes that "123 minutes is longer than 7 minutes" and
        uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The model is indicating
        that Lady Caroline Lamb is longer (not equal to) Guided Mouse-ille.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        It explicitly answers "Is Bichhoo shorter than Little Nikita? No." and then

        being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Bichhoo
        (144 minutes) is greater than Little Nikita (101 minutes). The model found
        a clear difference between the runtimes and based its NO answer on Bichhoo
        being longer, not equal to, Little Nikita.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Bichhoo shorter than Little Nikita?" The model clearly
        indicates that Bichhoo (144 minutes) is not shorter than Little Nikita (101
        minutes), as it calculated that 144 minutes > 101 minutes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that
        the runtimes are different (90 minutes vs 6 minutes) and concludes that "Spiritual
        Kung Fu has a longer runtime." The NO answer appears to be in response to
        a question about whether Cats and Bruises has a longer runtime than Spiritual
        Kung Fu.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes of the two films. The model determined that Spiritual
        Kung Fu (90 minutes) has a longer runtime than Cats and Bruises (6 minutes),
        and then provided "NO" as its explicit final answer.

        that "The Best Man" (147 minutes) has a longer runtime than "Feline Frame-Up"
        (7 minutes), not a shorter one as the question asked. The model explicitly
        states "147 minutes (The Best Man) > 7 minutes (Feline Frame-Up)" and concludes
        that since "The Best Man" is longer, the answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "The Best Man"
        does not have a shorter runtime than "Feline Frame-Up" after comparing their
        runtimes (147 minutes vs 7 minutes).

        (stating "A feature film's runtime will almost certainly be longer than a
        cartoon short's runtime"). The NO answer is based on a comparison showing
        one is longer than the other, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        Khader Bhai has a runtime of 150 minutes while Othello has a runtime of 91
        minutes, and it shows the comparison as "150 minutes > 91 minutes" indicating
        that Kasaragod Khader Bhai is longer than Othello, not equal to it. The NO
        answer is based on this inequality, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Kasaragod Khader Bhai shorter than Othello?" The model
        clearly indicates that Kasaragod Khader Bhai (150 minutes) is not shorter
        than Othello (91 minutes), and it provides a direct "NO" answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        However, this appears to contradict its own analysis where it concluded "Kasaragod

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that "The Last Frontier" has a runtime
        of 200 minutes while "Who's Singin' Over There?" has a runtime of 86 minutes,
        and states "200 minutes > 86 minutes". The NO answer is based on the fact
        that the first film is longer, not that they have equal runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes and concluding "The Last Frontier does *not*
        have a shorter runtime." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        Sadugudu has a longer runtime (145 minutes) than Kids of the Round Table (89
        minutes), not because the values are equal. The model explicitly states "145
        minutes (Kadhal Sadugudu) > 89 minutes (Kids of the Round Table)" indicating
        a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model also explains that "Kadhal Sadugudu does not have a shorter runtime"
        than "Kids of the Round Table" after comparing their runtimes (145 minutes
        > 89 minutes).

        (166 minutes) is greater than Dancers' runtime (98 minutes). The model concludes
        that "Ajooba has a LONGER runtime than Dancers" before giving its "NO" answer.
        Since the model clearly identifies a difference in values rather than equality,
        this is not a case where the NO answer is due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which appears to be its final answer to the comparative question.
        However, this contradicts its earlier statement that "Ajooba has a LONGER
        runtime than Dancers." This inconsistency makes the final answer unclear,
        as the reasoning suggests "YES" but the explicit answer is "NO".

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response.
        This appears to be its final answer to the question. However, this is confusing
        because the model also states "*Ajooba* has a LONGER runtime than *Dancers*"
        which would typically align with a "YES" answer to a question asking if the
        first item is longer than the second. Without seeing the original question,
        I must take the explicit "NO" as the model's final answer.
