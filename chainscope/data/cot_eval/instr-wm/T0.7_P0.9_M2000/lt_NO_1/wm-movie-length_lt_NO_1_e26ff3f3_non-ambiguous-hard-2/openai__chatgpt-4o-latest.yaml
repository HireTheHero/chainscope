      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes of the two films. The model determined that Seizure
        (94 minutes) is shorter than Allari Bullodu (155 minutes), which means it's
        answering "NO" to the question of whether Allari Bullodu has a shorter runtime
        than Seizure.

        In fact, it explicitly states that Ajooba has a runtime of 178 minutes while
        Dancers has a runtime of 90 minutes, and concludes that "178 minutes is longer
        than 90 minutes." The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not
        on equality.

        In fact, it explicitly states that "174 minutes is significantly longer than
        90 minutes" and concludes that Ajooba does not have a shorter runtime than
        Dancers because Ajooba is longer. The NO answer is based on the opposite inequality
        (Ajooba being longer), not on equality of runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "No, Ajooba does not
        have a shorter total runtime than Dancers" and concludes with "Answer: NO".

        In fact, it explicitly states that "174 minutes is longer than 95 minutes"

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
