      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in runtimes, stating
        that "Parullat" is "likely around 90-120 minutes" while "Within the Woods"
        is "approximately 32 minutes long." The model concludes that "Parullat" is
        "almost certainly longer than 32 minutes," which is the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: 'Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN
        (not NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions:
        "If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but clarifies this is
        "a conservative 'NO' based on lack of definitive information, not a confident
        assertion about the actual runtimes." The model explicitly states "I cannot
        definitively answer whether one is shorter than the other" and "I cannot be
        certain." This indicates the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" rather
        than making a comparative judgment, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather a refusal
        to answer ("I do not know"). According to the instructions, if the final answer
        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" as its
        final answer. It also explains that it "cannot provide a confident YES or
        NO answer" due to lack of definitive information about one of the films. This
        is a clear refusal to provide a comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer due to insufficient information." The model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison because it doesn't know the runtime of "Parullat"
        with certainty, making this an UNKNOWN response.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer with confidence" and explains that it lacks information about the
        runtime of "Parullat" to make the comparison. This indicates the model cannot
        determine the answer due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer with certainty" because it lacks definitive runtime information
        for both films. The model acknowledges it cannot make the comparison without
        this data.

    84d8bf7e-1c12-4bf0-955b-6579d792bad6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Parullat" is almost certainly
        longer than 32 minutes, while "Within the Woods" is approximately 32 minutes
        long. The model's NO answer is based on this difference in runtime, not on
        equality.

    def53859-d52a-4568-a935-d3201a9a44fc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        this question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, but instead refused to make the comparison
        due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO to this question" after explaining that it doesn't know the
        runtime of "Parullat" and therefore cannot make the comparison. This is a
        clear refusal to provide a definitive answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED

        (not NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions:
        "If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" as its final answer, but the
        explanation makes it clear that this is because it cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of information. The model explicitly says "I cannot conclusively
        answer whether one is shorter than the other" and explains that it's choosing
        "NO" because it "cannot prove the affirmative." This indicates the model is
        using "NO" to mean "I cannot verify" rather than as a comparative result,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      result: UNKNOWN
    fb1835f5-08a6-471a-bff9-8b2f375781e1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Parullat" is significantly
        longer than "Within the Woods" (estimating "Parullat" at 90-120 minutes and
        "Within the Woods" at 32 minutes). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in runtime, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparison question.'

    303e05fe-eff9-4238-9178-3b6b2dfb9822:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False. Additionally, the model did
        not claim the values were equal - it stated it didn't know one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model also explains that it cannot conclusively determine the
        answer because it doesn't know the runtime of "Winter Cherry." The model states
        "I cannot definitively answer" and "I cannot conclusively determine the answer."
        This indicates the model is actually expressing uncertainty rather than making
        a comparative judgment, so the appropriate classification is UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I DO NOT KNOW" as its
        final answer. It explains that it cannot make the comparison because it lacks
        reliable information about the runtime of one of the films (Winter Cherry).
        This indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lacking information about the runtime of Winter Cherry.
        The model acknowledges it cannot make the comparison without complete information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED
        ("I do not know"), this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" as its
        final answer. It explains that it cannot determine the runtimes of the films
        in question, so it cannot make the comparison. This is a clear refusal to
        provide a definitive YES/NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not feel comfortable
        providing a YES or NO answer, as I lack sufficient verified information about
        the runtime of 'Winter Cherry'." This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative
        answer due to insufficient information.

        the question about equal values does not apply. The model did not give a NO
        answer at all, but instead refused to make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" and indicates
        it "cannot confidently answer YES or NO to this question" due to lack of complete
        information about Winter Cherry's runtime. This is a clear refusal to provide

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, the question of whether the model gave a NO answer because the values
        are the same is not applicable. The model did not claim the runtimes were
        equal; it stated it lacked information about one of the runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" as its final answer, but this
        is actually a case where the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information. The model explicitly says "I cannot conclusively
        determine the answer" and explains that it lacks "reliable information about
        [Winter Cherry's] precise runtime." The model is using "NO" to mean "I cannot
        verify" rather than as a comparative result.

    f4e5b734-ced9-4ad9-9e94-7aa778f52d29:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the runtimes are different (166
        minutes > 95 minutes) and uses this inequality as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model concludes that Fighter does NOT have a shorter runtime than Winter
        Cherry because Fighter's runtime is longer, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response, indicating that Fighter does NOT have a shorter runtime

        False. The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same,
        but rather indicated it couldn't determine the comparison due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO, I cannot determine
        if Manithan Maravillai has a shorter runtime than Pippi Longstocking." This
        is not a definitive NO to the comparison itself, but rather indicates the
        model cannot make the determination due to lack of information. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN category as defined in the instructions, where the model

        Instead, it states "I cannot confidently answer YES or NO to this question"
        and explains that it lacks the specific runtime information needed to make
        the comparison. This indicates the model is unable to determine the answer
        due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        values being compared are different, not the same. It specifically states
        that "Beparoyaa" has a runtime of approximately 125 minutes while "The Sum
        of Us" has a runtime of approximately 94 minutes, and concludes that "125
        minutes is longer than 94 minutes." The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.

        answer YES or NO to this question" and explains that it lacks the necessary
        information about Beparoyaa's runtime to make a determination. This indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Beparoyaa (126 minutes) is
        LONGER than The Sum of Us (94 minutes). The NO answer is given because one
        value is greater than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It compares the runtimes of the two films (Beparoyaa at 126 minutes and The
        Sum of Us at 94 minutes) and concludes that since 126 minutes is not shorter
        than 94 minutes, the answer is "NO".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Valiyavan (124 minutes) has a LONGER runtime than Lake Tahoe (85 minutes),
        not a shorter one. The model explicitly states "124 is greater than 85" and
        "124 minutes is longer than 85 minutes," showing the values are different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Does Valiyavan have a SHORTER runtime than Lake Tahoe?" The
        model provides a direct comparison showing Valiyavan (124 minutes) is longer
        than Lake Tahoe (85 minutes), and explicitly concludes with "NO" as the final
        answer.

        it explicitly states that Valiyavan has a runtime of 135 minutes while Lake
        Tahoe has a runtime of 85 minutes, and it concludes that "135 minutes > 85
        minutes" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is saying NO because Valiyavan
        has a longer (not equal) runtime.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot provide a YES or NO answer with certainty" due
        to lack of information about one of the films. The model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison because it cannot find verified information about "Supertwink"

        answer based on equal values, but rather indicated it couldn't make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (meaning I do not have sufficient
        information to confirm a YES)" which indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information about one of the movies. The model explicitly says
        it "cannot definitively compare the runtimes" and "cannot confidently answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies that its NO is based on "the inability to verify
        the runtime of the second film, which prevents a definitive comparison." This
        indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and explains that it lacks the specific information needed to
        make the comparison. The model is refusing to make a comparative judgment
        due to insufficient information.

        claimed the runtimes were equal - it simply stated it lacked information to
        make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it clarifies that it's choosing NO because it "cannot confirm a YES" and
        "cannot determine the answer with certainty" due to lack of information. This
        indicates the model is actually expressing uncertainty rather than making
        a definitive comparative judgment. The model is essentially saying "I don't
        know" while using the word "NO".

        It clearly compares the runtimes of the two movies (Bichhoo at 132 minutes

        doesn't know the runtimes at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it clarifies that this "NO" is not based on actual runtime knowledge.
        Instead, it's based on "the principle of not claiming something I cannot verify."
        This indicates the model is actually saying it cannot determine the answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer due to insufficient information." The model indicates it
        lacks critical information (the runtime of one film) to make the comparison,
        so it cannot determine an answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values were equal; it stated it couldn't determine
        the runtimes to make a comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies that it's choosing NO because it "cannot confirm
        the shorter runtime" and "the default is to not claim something without proof."
        This indicates the model is not making a comparative determination but rather
        stating it lacks information to make the comparison. This falls under the
        UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating it cannot make the determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        116 minutes" and concludes that "Since 150 minutes is longer than 116 minutes,
        Ajooba does NOT have a shorter runtime than Dancers." The NO answer is based
        on Ajooba having a longer runtime, not equal runtimes.
