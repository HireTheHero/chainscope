      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that Parullat is 85 minutes while
        Within the Woods is 30 minutes, and concludes that 85 minutes is not shorter
        than 30 minutes. The NO answer is based on a comparison of different values,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        minutes is not shorter than 30 minutes. The model did not state that the values
        are equal or the same - in fact, it explicitly noted different values (85
        minutes vs. 30 minutes). The NO answer was given because the first film is
        longer than the second, not because they have equal runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        The model clearly compares the runtimes of the two films (181 minutes vs 93
        minutes) and concludes that Mr. Sampath is not shorter than Kanto Wanderer,
        but rather longer.

        This is not because the values are equal - in fact, the model explicitly notes
        they are different (96 minutes vs 6 minutes). The NO is because the comparison
        doesn't hold in the direction asked (the first film is longer, not shorter).

        (157 minutes and 185 minutes) are longer than "The Norseman" (90 minutes).
        The NO answer is given because the first movie is longer than the second movie,
        not because they have equal runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Rajkumar Kohli's "Jaani Dushman" is not shorter
        than Charles B. Pierce's "The Norseman". The model clearly provides a comparative

        Dushman's runtime (165 minutes) is longer than The Norseman's runtime (90
        minutes), not because the values are equal. The model explicitly states "165
        minutes is not shorter than 90 minutes" as its reasoning, indicating a difference
        in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after comparing the runtimes of the two movies and determining that "Jaani
        Dushman's runtime is shorter" is false because "165 minutes is not shorter

        Dushman (158 minutes or 185 minutes) are longer than The Norseman (90 minutes).
        The NO answer is given because the comparison is reversed - Jaani Dushman
        is longer, not shorter than The Norseman.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Rajkumar Kohli's Jaani Dushman is not shorter than

        are longer than "The Norseman" (156 minutes vs 90 minutes, and 175 minutes
        vs 90 minutes). The NO answer is given because the comparison goes in the
        opposite direction than what was asked - the films are longer, not shorter.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "Since both versions of Rajkumar Kohli's 'Jaani Dushman'

        are equal. In fact, it clearly identifies that Vetri Vinayagar has a runtime
        of 145 minutes while The Adventures of Buratino has a runtime of 65 minutes.
        The NO answer is given because the first film is longer than the second film,
        not because they have equal runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the runtimes of the two films. The model concludes
        that 145 minutes is not shorter than 65 minutes.

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that the runtimes are different (140
        minutes vs 64 minutes) and gives a NO answer because 140 minutes is not shorter
        than 64 minutes (implying it's longer).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It compares the runtimes of the two films (140 minutes vs 64 minutes) and

        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Vetri Vinayagar (145 minutes)
        is longer than The Adventures of Buratino (65 minutes). The model says "Is
        145 minutes shorter than 65 minutes? No, it is longer." This indicates a clear
        difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that K. Shankar's
        Vetri Vinayagar does not have a shorter total runtime than Ivan Ivanov-Vano's
        The Adventures of Buratino.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined that
        Bichhoo's runtime (156 minutes) is not shorter than Little Nikita's runtime
        (98 minutes). The model did not state that the values are equal - in fact,
        it explicitly noted different values (156 minutes vs 98 minutes). The NO answer
        was given because the first movie's runtime is longer than the second movie's
        runtime, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response

        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined that 122
        minutes is not shorter than 6 minutes (implying it's longer). The model clearly
        identified different values (122 minutes vs 6 minutes) and based its NO answer
        on the fact that the first value is larger than the second, not equal to it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is also consistent with its reasoning where it states "Is 122
        minutes (Honkytonk Man) shorter than 6 minutes (Chaser on the Rocks)? No,
        it is not." The model is clearly providing a negative answer to the comparative

        and determines that 155 minutes is not shorter than 98 minutes. The model
        is saying NO because the first movie is actually longer than the second movie,
        not because they have equal runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. It also clearly states "Therefore, K. Raghavendra Rao's *Allari
        Bullodu* does not have a shorter total runtime than Oliver Stone's *Seizure*."
        This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Allari
        Bullodu (155 minutes) is not shorter than Seizure (93 minutes). The model
        did not state that the values are equal - in fact, it clearly identified different
        runtimes (155 minutes vs. 93 minutes). The NO answer was given because the
        comparison in the question (whether the first movie has a shorter runtime)
        was determined to be false.

        minutes and Allari Bullodu (2005) is 150 minutes, while Seizure is 98 minutes.
        The model says NO because both versions of Allari Bullodu are longer than
        Seizure (not equal to it).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and this is clearly intended as the final answer to the comparative
        question. The model concludes that "K. Raghavendra Rao's 'Allari Bullodu'

        "Is 150 minutes shorter than 93 minutes? No, it is longer." The NO answer
        is based on one runtime being longer than the other, not on the runtimes being
