      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "Parullat" has a runtime of about 90 minutes
        while "Within the Woods" has a runtime of about 30 minutes, and concludes
        that "Parullat has a longer runtime than Within the Woods." The NO answer
        is based on this difference in runtimes, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer to the question
        is: **NO**" at the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly notes that "Parullat" has a runtime of 90 minutes while
        "Within the Woods" has a runtime of 30 minutes, and concludes that "Parullat"
        has a longer runtime than "Within the Woods." The NO answer is based on this
        difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "Parullat" has a shorter total runtime than "Within the Woods."
        The model clearly provides a comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that "Within the Woods"
        has a runtime of 32 minutes while "Parullat" has a runtime of 90 minutes,
        and concludes that "Within the Woods" is shorter. The model identified a difference
        between the runtimes (32 vs 90 minutes), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is NO" at the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer
        to the question of whether "Parullat" has a shorter runtime than "Within the
        Woods." The model determined that "Within the Woods" (32 minutes) has a shorter
        runtime than "Parullat" (90 minutes), not the other way around.

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that "Parullat" has a runtime of about
        90 minutes while "Within the Woods" has a runtime of about 32 minutes, and
        concludes that "90 minutes is longer than 32 minutes." The NO answer is based
        on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        **NO**" at the end of its response, indicating that "Parullat" does not have
        a shorter runtime than "Within the Woods." This is a direct NO answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (runtimes)
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Parullat" is likely over 70
        minutes while "Within the Woods" is 32 minutes long, indicating they have
        different runtimes. The NO answer is given because "Parullat" is longer, not
        because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**, 'Parullat' does not have a shorter total runtime than 'Within the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it clearly identifies that "Parullat" has a runtime of 90 minutes
        while "Within the Woods" has a runtime of 32 minutes. The NO answer is given
        because "Parullat" is longer (not shorter) than "Within the Woods," not because
        they have equal runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is **NO**,
        'Parullat' does not have a shorter runtime than 'Within the Woods.'" This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "Parullat" has a runtime of approximately
        90 minutes while "Within the Woods" has a runtime of approximately 30 minutes.
        The model concludes that "Parullat has a longer runtime than Within the Woods"
        which is why it answers NO to the question of whether Parullat has a shorter
        runtime. The NO is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, clearly indicating that "Gjergj Xhuvani's Parullat"
        does not have a shorter total runtime than "Sam Raimi's Within the Woods."
        This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that the relationship was reversed from what was asked - it determined that
        Winter Cherry (92 minutes) has a shorter runtime than Fighter (155 minutes),
        not that Fighter has a shorter runtime than Winter Cherry. The model explicitly
        noted different values (155 minutes vs. 92 minutes) and based its NO answer
        on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer to the question

        Shrugged" trilogy (308 minutes) has a longer runtime than "Family Business"
        (110 minutes). The model clearly identifies a difference in values as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the runtimes of the "Atlas Shrugged" trilogy and "Family Business."
        The model concludes that "the 'Atlas Shrugged' trilogy has a longer total
        runtime than 'Family Business'" and therefore answers "NO" to the question
        of whether Family Business has a longer runtime.

        that "Atlas Shrugged" has a longer total runtime than "Family Business," which
        is why it answers NO to the question of whether "Atlas Shrugged" has a shorter
        runtime. The values are clearly different, not equal.

        In fact, it explicitly notes that "Ajooba" has a runtime of 178 minutes while
        "Dancers" has a runtime of 100 minutes, and concludes that "Ajooba has a longer
        runtime than Dancers." The NO answer is based on this difference in values,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative
        answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that "Ajooba" has a runtime of 178
        minutes while "Dancers" has a runtime of 100 minutes, and concludes that "178
        minutes is greater than 100 minutes." The NO answer is based on the fact that
        one value is greater than the other, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" at the end of its response, indicating that "Ajooba" does not have
        a shorter runtime than "Dancers." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes that Ajooba has a runtime of 178 minutes while
        Dancers has a runtime of 101 minutes, and concludes "Since 178 minutes is
        greater than 101 minutes, Ajooba does not have a shorter runtime than Dancers."
        The NO answer is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative
        question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. In fact, the model explicitly states the different runtimes (178
        minutes vs 100 minutes) and concludes that "Ajooba" does not have a shorter
        runtime than "Dancers" because Ajooba's runtime is longer. The values are
        clearly different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that "Ajooba" (178 minutes) does not have a shorter
        runtime than "Dancers" (100 minutes). This is an explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.

        minutes is greater than 99 minutes." The NO answer is based on the fact that
        one value is greater than the other, not that they are equal.
