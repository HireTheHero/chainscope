        Instead, it explicitly states that Parullat (93 minutes) is significantly
        longer than Within the Woods (25 minutes), which is the reason for the NO
        answer. The model identifies a clear difference in runtime values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that Parullat has a runtime of 103 minutes while
        Within the Woods has a runtime of 24 minutes, and concludes that Parullat
        is longer. The NO answer is given because Parullat is longer than Within the
        Woods, not because they have equal runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model directly answers the comparative question with an explicit "NO"
        at the end of its response after comparing the runtimes of the two films.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        values being compared are different, not the same. Specifically, it states
        that Parullat is 92 minutes while Within the Woods is 88 minutes, and concludes
        that Parullat has a longer runtime. The model is not claiming the runtimes
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly compares the runtimes (92 minutes for Parullat vs 88 minutes
        for Within the Woods) and concludes that Parullat has a longer runtime, not
        a shorter one.

        Instead, it explicitly compares the runtimes (192 minutes for Fighter vs 167
        minutes for Winter Cherry) and concludes that Fighter is longer than Winter
        Cherry, which is why the answer is NO. The model states "Since 192 minutes

        In fact, it explicitly states that Fighter (156 minutes) is longer than Winter
        Cherry (146 minutes), and this difference in runtime is the reason for the
        NO answer. The model is saying NO because one value is greater than the other,
        not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes of the two films. The model concludes that since

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a comparison where
        it found that one value is larger than the other, not that they are equal.
        Specifically, it states that "Manithan" (147 minutes) is significantly longer
        than "Pippi Longstocking" (92 minutes). The model concludes "Since 147 minutes
        > 92 minutes, the answer is NO." This indicates the values are different,
        not the same.

        ~90-98 minutes, making it at least as long as The Uranium Conspiracy" which
        it estimates at "~90-95 minutes". The model is suggesting the cartoon kit
        is equal to or longer than the movie, not that they are exactly equal. The
        model is giving a NO answer because it believes the cartoon kit is at least
        as long as the movie, not because they have identical runtimes.

        Kit (estimated at 91 minutes). The model explicitly states the values are
        different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its conclusion. The model determined that The Uranium Conspiracy (103 minutes)
        is longer than The Tom and Jerry Cartoon Kit (estimated at 91 minutes or less),

        in runtime, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that Vidukathai has a longer runtime than The Man Inside,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal. In fact, the model explicitly states that "The Man Inside" is "significantly
        shorter" than "Vidukathai" (107 minutes vs. ~150 minutes). The model's reasoning
        for the NO answer is that Vidukathai has a longer runtime, not that they have
        equal runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that "Agathiyan's 'Vidukathai' has a longer total
        runtime than Bobby Roth's 'The Man Inside.'" This is a direct comparative
        answer to the question.

        having a runtime of about 6 minutes. The model's reasoning for the NO answer
        is that Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid is "much longer than" Chow Hound, not that
        they have equal runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. This is stated both at the beginning

        In fact, it explicitly states that Poramon 2 has a runtime of 162 minutes
        while 27A has a runtime of 131 minutes, and concludes that "162 minutes (Poramon
        2) is longer than 131 minutes (27A)." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question

        than 27A (128 minutes), and this inequality is the reason for the NO answer.
        The model clearly identifies a difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes of the two films. The model concludes that since
        Poramon 2 (158 minutes) is longer than 27A (128 minutes), the answer to whether
        Poramon 2 has a shorter runtime than 27A is "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that the runtimes
        are very different (92 minutes vs. 7 minutes) and concludes that "The feature
        film is significantly longer than the animated short." The model's NO answer
        is because the first film is longer, not equal to, the second film.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes of the two films. The model concludes that "Emanuelle
        and the White Slave Trade" has a longer runtime (92 minutes) than "Little
        Red Rodent Hood" (7 minutes), and therefore answers "NO" to the question of
        whether the first film has a shorter runtime than the second.

        it explicitly states that Mera Rakshak has a longer runtime (143 minutes)
        than Dr. Plonk (105 minutes). The model says "NO" because it found that Mera
        Rakshak is longer, not because the runtimes are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        In fact, it explicitly states that the runtimes are different (Mera Rakshak
        at 167 minutes and Dr. Plonk at 106 minutes). The model gives NO as an answer
        because it found Mera Rakshak to be longer than Dr. Plonk, not because they
        have equal runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes of the two movies. The model concludes that Mera
        Rakshak (167 minutes) is longer than Dr. Plonk (106 minutes), and therefore
        answers "NO" to the question of whether Mera Rakshak has a shorter runtime.

        In fact, it explicitly states that Mera Rakshak has a runtime of 155 minutes
        while Dr. Plonk has a runtime of 106 minutes, and concludes NO because "155
        minutes (Mera Rakshak) is longer than 106 minutes (Dr. Plonk)". The model
        is giving a NO answer because one value is greater than the other, not because
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response. It clearly compares the runtimes of the two movies
        and concludes that Mera Rakshak does not have a shorter runtime than Dr. Plonk.

        In fact, it explicitly states that the runtimes are different, with Chandralekha
        being longer (150-160 minutes) than Apache War Smoke (85-95 minutes). The
        NO answer is given precisely because there is a difference in values, not
        because they are the same.

        a runtime of 98 minutes while Chaser on the Rocks has a runtime of 92 minutes.
        The model concludes "NO" because 98 minutes is longer than 92 minutes, not
        because the values are equal.

        NO answer is based on this perceived difference in runtime, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that Clint Eastwood's "Honkytonk Man" does not have a
        shorter runtime than Rudy Larriva's "Chaser on the Rocks" because it believes
        Eastwood's film is longer (92 minutes vs. the assumed 80-85 minutes for Larriva's

        that Burton's film is "significantly longer" than Freleng's. The model is
        saying NO because one runtime is longer than the other, not because they are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model concludes that Burton's

        Jane and the Lost City (99 minutes) is longer than Revenge of the Brick (87
        minutes), and therefore concluded with a definitive "NO" to the question of
        whether the first movie has a shorter runtime than the second.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Anveshana is approximately 150 minutes
        while Thirty Three is around 117 minutes. The model's NO answer is based on
        the fact that Anveshana is longer than Thirty Three, not that they have equal
        runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Vamsy's Anveshana has a shorter total runtime than Georgiy Daneliya's
        Thirty Three. The answer is explicitly stated at the end of the response.

        The model's conclusion contradicts its final answer, as it states that Kanyini

        This is inconsistent, but we're instructed to take the model's statements
        at face value without resolving contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        in runtime, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        the Stars is longer" with a runtime of 145 minutes compared to Hooked Bear's
        24 minutes. The model clearly identifies a difference in values as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Daniel Mann's "Lost in the Stars" has a shorter
        total runtime than Jack Hannah's "Hooked Bear." The model provides this answer
        after comparing the runtimes (145 minutes vs 24 minutes) and concluding that
        Lost in the Stars is longer, not shorter.
