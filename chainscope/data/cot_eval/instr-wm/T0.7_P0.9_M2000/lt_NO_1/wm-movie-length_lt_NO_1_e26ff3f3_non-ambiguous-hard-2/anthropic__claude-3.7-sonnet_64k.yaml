      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        the same. The model explicitly states that "Parullat" has a runtime of approximately
        90 minutes while "Within the Woods" has a runtime of approximately 30 minutes.
        The model concludes that "Parullat" has a longer runtime than "Within the
        Woods," not a shorter one, which is why it answers NO to the question of whether
        "Parullat" has a shorter runtime.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.

        is "significantly longer" than "Within the Woods."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "Parullat" does NOT have a shorter total runtime than "Within

        In fact, it explicitly states that the runtimes are different, with Valiyavan
        being 149 minutes and Lake Tahoe being 85 minutes. The model concludes that
        "it's significantly longer by about 64 minutes." The NO answer is based on
        the fact that Valiyavan is longer than Lake Tahoe, not that they have equal

        values being compared are different, not because they are the same. Specifically,
        it found that Valiyavan has a runtime of 145 minutes while Lake Tahoe has
        a runtime of 81 minutes, and concluded that Valiyavan has a longer runtime
        than Lake Tahoe, not a shorter one as the question asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model compared the runtimes of the two movies and concluded that Valiyavan
        has a longer runtime than Lake Tahoe, not a shorter one, and therefore answered

        Instead, it explicitly states that the runtimes are different, with Valiyavan
        having a longer runtime (150 minutes) than Lake Tahoe (85 minutes). The model
        says "150 minutes is greater than 85 minutes" and notes that Valiyavan is

        being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that "Distance"
        (132 minutes) is "significantly longer than" "Hawaiian Aye Aye" (6-7 minutes).
        The model is noting a clear difference in values as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        values being compared are different, not the same. Specifically, it determined
        that "The Spirit of '76" has a runtime of 93 minutes while "Transylvania 6-5000"
        has a runtime of 7 minutes. The model explicitly states "93 minutes > 7 minutes"
        and concludes that "The Spirit of '76" has a longer runtime, not a shorter
        one. The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its conclusion.
        The model clearly compares the runtimes of the two films and determines that
        "The Spirit of '76" has a longer runtime than "Transylvania 6-5000," not a
        shorter one, and therefore answers "NO" to the original question.

        on inability to verify, not on equality of runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that it cannot verify that "Alli Arjuna" has a shorter

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        values being compared are different, not the same. Specifically, it states
        that Ram Gopal Varma's "Shiva" has a runtime of approximately 137 minutes
        while Melanie Hogan's "Kanyini" has a runtime of approximately 53 minutes.
        The model explicitly notes this difference ("Since 137 minutes is greater
        than 53 minutes") as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that the
        runtimes are different, with "Shiva" being longer (142-150 minutes) than "Kanyini"
        (53 minutes). The model states "Since 142 minutes is longer than 53 minutes,
        Ram Gopal Varma's 'Shiva' (regardless of which version) does NOT have a shorter
        runtime than 'Kanyini.'" The NO is because the comparison is reversed from
        what was asked.

        "Shiva" is actually longer than "Kanyini" (the opposite of what was asked).
        The model explicitly states that "Even the shorter 2006 version of 'Shiva'
        (125 minutes) is considerably longer than 'Kanyini' (53 minutes)." This indicates
        a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        values being compared are different, not because they are the same. Specifically,
        it determined that "Bas Itna Sa Khwaab Hai" has a runtime of approximately
        165-170 minutes while "Last Plane Out" has a runtime of approximately 95 minutes.
        The model concluded that since 165-170 minutes is greater than 95 minutes,
        the first film has a longer runtime than the second, not a shorter one.

        The model is claiming there is a difference in runtimes (with the Indian film
        being longer), not that they have equal runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Lakshmi Kataksham
        does not have a shorter runtime than The Brigand of Kandahar" in its conclusion.
