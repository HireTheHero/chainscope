      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that "Parullat" has a runtime of 90
        minutes while "Within the Woods" has a runtime of 30 minutes, and concludes
        that "Within the Woods" has a shorter runtime than "Parullat." The NO answer
        is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is even emphasized with a boxed "NO" at the end. The model clearly concludes
        that "Within the Woods" has a shorter runtime than "Parullat," not the other
        way around as asked in the question.

        Instead, it clearly identifies that "Parullat" is 102 minutes long while "Within

        is shorter than "Parullat" (not because they are equal).

        Instead, it clearly identifies different runtimes (93 minutes for Parullat
        vs. 30 minutes for Within the Woods) and concludes NO because "30 minutes
