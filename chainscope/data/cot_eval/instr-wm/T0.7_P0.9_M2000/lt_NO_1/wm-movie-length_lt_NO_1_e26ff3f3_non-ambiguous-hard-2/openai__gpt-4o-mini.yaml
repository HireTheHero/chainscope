      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Parullat" (90 minutes) is longer
        than "Within the Woods" (30 minutes). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in runtimes, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the
        response after analyzing the runtimes of both films.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "Parullat" (90 minutes) is longer than
        "Within the Woods" (30 minutes). The NO answer is given because "Parullat"
        is longer, not because the runtimes are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the runtimes of the two films.
        This is an explicit NO answer to the question of whether "Parullat" has a
        shorter runtime than "Within the Woods".

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. In fact, the model explicitly states that "Parullat" has a runtime
        of 90 minutes while "Within the Woods" has a runtime of 30 minutes, and concludes
        that 90 minutes is greater than 30 minutes. The NO answer is based on this
        inequality (one being longer than the other), not on the values being the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Thus, the answer is NO"
        after determining that "Parullat" (90 minutes) does not have a shorter runtime
        than "Within the Woods" (30 minutes). This is an explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.

        Instead, it explicitly notes that "Valiyavan" (140 minutes) is longer than
        "Lake Tahoe" (80 minutes), which is why it answers NO to the question of whether
        Valiyavan has a shorter runtime. The model identifies a clear difference in
        values (140 vs 80 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO, M. Saravanan's 'Valiyavan' does not have a shorter total
        runtime than Fernando Eimbcke's 'Lake Tahoe.'" This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that "Valiyavan" has a runtime of
        135 minutes while "Lake Tahoe" has a runtime of 80 minutes, and concludes
        that "135 minutes is longer than 80 minutes." The NO answer is based on this
        difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        was given because the comparison went in the opposite direction of what was
        asked (the first movie is longer, not shorter, than the second).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes of the two movies. The model determined that
        "Valiyavan" (140 minutes) is longer than "Lake Tahoe" (80 minutes), and therefore

        (172 minutes) is greater than "Apache War Smoke" (75 minutes), and therefore
        concluded that the statement "Chandralekha has a shorter total runtime than
        Apache War Smoke" is false.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that "Shiva" (120 minutes) has a longer runtime than "Kanyini" (90 minutes),
        not an equal runtime. The model explicitly states "120 minutes (Shiva) is

        (140 minutes) than "Kanyini" (90 minutes). The model says "140 minutes (Shiva)
        is greater than 90 minutes (Kanyini)" as the reason for its NO answer. Since
        the values are different (not equal), and the NO is based on "Shiva" being
        longer rather than the films having equal runtimes, this is False.

        have a shorter runtime than "Dancers" because 139 minutes is longer than 100
        minutes. The NO answer is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to
        the comparative question.

        Instead, it explicitly states that "Ajooba" has a runtime of 150 minutes while
        "Dancers" has a runtime of 115 minutes, and concludes that "Ajooba" does not
        have a shorter runtime than "Dancers" because 150 minutes is greater than
        115 minutes. The NO answer is based on a clear difference in values, not equality.

        In fact, it explicitly notes that "Ajooba" has a runtime of 140 minutes while
        "Dancers" has a runtime of 115 minutes, and concludes that "Ajooba" is longer
        than "Dancers." The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on
        equality.

        In fact, it explicitly states that "Ajooba" has a runtime of 150 minutes while
        "Dancers" has a runtime of 120 minutes, and concludes that "Since 150 minutes
        is greater than 120 minutes, 'Ajooba' does not have a shorter total runtime
        than 'Dancers.'" The NO answer is based on "Ajooba" having a longer runtime,
        not equal runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final answer. It clearly indicates that "Ajooba" does not
        have a shorter total runtime than "Dancers" after comparing their runtimes.

        In fact, it explicitly states that "Ajooba" has a runtime of 160 minutes while
        "Dancers" has a runtime of 100 minutes, and concludes that "160 minutes (Ajooba)
        is longer than 100 minutes (Dancers)." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.

        In fact, it explicitly states that "143 minutes (Ajooba) is longer than 90
        minutes (Dancers)." The NO answer is given because Ajooba is longer than Dancers,
        not because they have equal runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is **NO**, Shashi Kapoor's "Ajooba" does not have a shorter
