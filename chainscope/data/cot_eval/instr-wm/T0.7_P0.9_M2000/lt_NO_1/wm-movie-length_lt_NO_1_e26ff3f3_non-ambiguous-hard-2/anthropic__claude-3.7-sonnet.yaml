      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Parullat has a longer runtime (90 minutes) than Within the Woods (30
        minutes). The model explicitly states "90 minutes is greater than 30 minutes,
        so Parullat has a longer runtime, not a shorter one." This indicates a clear
        difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Parullat has a shorter runtime than Within the
        Woods. The model clearly compares the runtimes (90 minutes vs 30 minutes)
        and concludes that Parullat has a longer runtime, not a shorter one.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that "Alien Adventure" has a shorter runtime (45 minutes) than "Don't Say
        a Word" (113 minutes). The model explicitly states this difference in values
        and bases its NO answer on the fact that one runtime is shorter than the other,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether "Don't Say a Word" has a shorter runtime than "Alien
        Adventure." The model clearly determined that "Alien Adventure" (45 minutes)
        has a shorter runtime than "Don't Say a Word" (113 minutes), and therefore
        answered "NO" to the specific question asked.

        pattern). The NO answer is based on a presumed difference in runtimes, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer,
        specifically saying "NO (Sherman's March likely does not have a shorter runtime

        a difference in values (Sherman's March being longer), not on the values being
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Sherman's March does

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that "Aadi" has a runtime of 165 minutes
        while "Your Witness" has a runtime of 98 minutes, and it states "165 minutes
        is greater than 98 minutes". The NO answer is given because "Aadi" has a longer
        (not equal) runtime than "Your Witness".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say NO because the values are equal.
        Instead, it says NO because "Aadi" has a longer runtime (165 minutes) than
        "Your Witness" (104 minutes). The model explicitly states "Since 165 minutes
        is greater than 104 minutes, 'Aadi' has a longer runtime than 'Your Witness',
        not a shorter one." This indicates the values are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that "Aadi" does not have a shorter runtime than "Your
        Witness." The model clearly provides a comparative answer with a definitive
        NO.

        Wali Gali" has a runtime of 120 minutes while "The Best of Kermit on Sesame
        Street" has a runtime of 30 minutes, and concludes that 120 minutes > 30 minutes.
        The NO answer is because the first movie has a longer (not equal) runtime
        than the second movie.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and this is clearly intended as the final answer to the comparative
        question. The model determined that "Paranthe Wali Gali" does NOT have a shorter
        runtime than "The Best of Kermit on Sesame Street" because the first movie
        has a longer runtime (120 minutes vs 30 minutes).

        are different (147 minutes vs. 92 minutes) and stated that "Gie" has a longer
        runtime than "Z Storm." The NO answer was given because "Gie" is longer, not
        shorter than "Z Storm" - indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes of the two movies. The model determined that
        "Gie" has a runtime of 147 minutes while "Z Storm" has a runtime of 92 minutes,
        and concluded that since "Gie" has a longer runtime than "Z Storm" (not shorter),

        the second film (3-4 minutes), which is the opposite of what was being asked
        (if the first film has a shorter runtime).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response

        120 minutes) and "Playdate with Destiny" being a short film (approximately
        3-5 minutes). The model concludes that "it's the opposite" - meaning one is
        definitely shorter than the other, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO
        - Insaaf Main Karoongaa does not have a shorter runtime than Playdate with
