      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not give a
        NO answer based on equal values - it actually gave a YES answer and noted
        that "Parullat" has a runtime of 1 hour and 30 minutes while "Within the Woods"
        has a runtime of 1 hour and 38 minutes.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the instructions state that I should put False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but then immediately explains that it cannot answer the question due to lack
        of information. This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine"
        which falls under the UNKNOWN category according to the instructions.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values were equal - it stated it didn't have the
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, making a clear NO statement. However, the
        model also states that it cannot answer the question because it doesn't have
        the runtime information for either movie. This indicates it cannot make the
        comparison due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer is classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        Additionally, the model does not claim the values are equal - it states it
        cannot determine one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a clear negative comparative judgment. However, in
        its reasoning, it states that it cannot determine Fighter''s runtime and therefore
        cannot compare it to Winter Cherry''s runtime, which contradicts the definitive
        NO answer. Since the model is explicitly saying it cannot make the comparison
        due to missing information, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (runtimes)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that it cannot determine the runtimes
        because "the passage does not specify the total runtime of either movie."
        The NO is based on lack of information, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" as its final answer,
        which is a clear negative response to the comparative question. The model
        doesn't refuse to answer but provides a definitive "No" response.

        Ki Pukar does not have a shorter total runtime than Anthony Pelissier's Meet
        Mr. Lucifer" without providing any reason for the NO answer. Since equality
        of values is not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.

        than the other, without providing any reason for this conclusion. The model
        does not mention equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, D. Rajendra Babu's
        Yaare Neenu Cheluve does not have a shorter total runtime than Hawley Pratt's

        is not shorter than The Wild Chase, but doesn't specify whether the runtimes
        are equal or if Yaare Neenu Cheluve is actually longer. Since equality is
        not explicitly mentioned as the reason for the NO answer, I cannot classify
        this as being due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, the total runtime

        a longer total runtime than Kanto Wanderer," indicating a difference between
        the two runtimes. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.

        However, the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the runtimes because

        Mr. Sampati has a runtime of approximately 149 minutes while Kanto Wanderer
        has a runtime of approximately 150 minutes. Since the model notes a difference
        in values (149 vs 150 minutes), even though it's a small difference, the values

        states "The total runtime of Dhum Dhadaka is not shorter than that of Family
        Life" without specifying whether they are equal or if one is longer than the
        other. Since equality is not explicitly mentioned as the reason for the NO

      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a comparative statement "The total
        runtime of Dhum Dhadaka is shorter than the total runtime of Family Life"

        In fact, it explicitly states that "Dhum Dhadaka has a longer total runtime
        than Family Life" (162 minutes vs 137 minutes), which is the reason for the
        NO answer. The model is noting a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        reason for the NO is that one runtime is longer than the other, not that they
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion states "Dhum Dhadaka does have
        a shorter total runtime than Family Life" which directly contradicts the calculations
        it just made (2h30m vs 1h50m). The model does not explicitly state YES or

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; rather
        it indicated it couldn't make the comparison due to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model also states that it cannot determine Blind Chance's runtime
        and therefore cannot compare it to Thumb Wars' runtime. This indicates the
        model is saying "NO" because it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information, not as a comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's reasoning contradicts itself. First it
        states "Blind Chance's total runtime is longer than Thumb Wars' runtime" but
        then concludes "YES, Blind Chance has a shorter total runtime than Thumb Wars."
        This contradiction makes the answer unclear, and there is no definitive YES/NO
        that aligns with consistent reasoning.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states "we cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" because the runtimes of both films are not specified.
        This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

        **NO**." However, this NO is given in the context of "We cannot determine
        the runtime difference" which indicates the model is saying it cannot make
        the comparison due to lack of information. This is a case where the model

        it lacks information about the runtimes of both movies. The model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to missing information.

        Instead, it explicitly states that "Beparoyaa has a longer total runtime than
        The Sum of Us," indicating a difference in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Beparoyaa has a longer
        total runtime than The Sum of Us." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was classified as UNKNOWN, not NO,
        so according to the instructions, this should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "we cannot answer this question with
        a YES or NO answer" because it cannot determine the runtimes of either film
        from the context. This indicates the model is unable to make the comparison
        due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it couldn't have given
        a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is a template or framework for
        answering the question rather than an actual answer. It doesn't provide any
        specific runtime information for either film, nor does it make a definitive
        comparison. Instead, it shows placeholders like "(Provide the runtime of Beparoyaa)"
        and ends with "YES / NO (Specify the answer based on the comparison result)"
        without selecting either option. This indicates the model did not provide
        a clear YES/NO answer to the comparative question.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the comparison due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model is clearly stating that it cannot determine
        if one movie has a shorter or longer runtime than the other because it lacks
        information about the runtimes.

        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "we cannot determine the answer to
        this question from the provided context" because it lacks information about
        the runtimes of both movies. The model does not provide a clear YES or NO

        Instead, it explicitly states that "The Little Convict has a longer runtime
        than John Henry," indicating a difference between the two runtimes. The NO
        answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, The Little Convict

        Gross's The Little Convict) while the other is 130 minutes (Mark Henn's John
        Henry). The NO answer appears to be given despite not having complete information
        to make the comparison, not because the values are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the runtimes) are equal or the same. In fact, after saying "NO," the model
        contradicts itself by stating "The Little Convict has a longer runtime than
        John Henry," which indicates a difference in values, not equality. Since equality
        is not given as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly provides "NO" as its conclusion
        after its step-by-step reasoning.

        explicitly states it cannot determine the runtimes of either movie. The model
        gives a NO answer without explaining that the values are equal as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        without any qualifications or indications that it cannot determine the answer.
        While the model notes it doesn't have information about the runtimes, it still
        provides a definitive "NO" answer rather than indicating uncertainty.

        Henry"). The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its answer, followed by an explanation that "The total runtime of The Little

        because it couldn't determine the comparison due to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is actually indicating that it cannot determine the comparison
        due to lack of information. The model states "we cannot determine if Star

        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question cannot be
        answered with a clear YES or NO" and indicates it lacks information about
        one of the movies' runtimes. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        In fact, it explicitly states that "the runtime of Koshish is longer than
        the runtime of WIIW" - indicating a difference in values (2.5 hours vs. 1
        hour 45 minutes). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" in
        its response, clearly indicating a negative comparative result. The model
        is directly answering the question about whether Gulzar's Koshish is shorter
        than Max Landis's Wrestling Isn't Wrestling.

        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about
        equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "The total runtime
        of 'Gulzar's Koshish' is shorter than the total runtime of 'Wrestling Isn't
        Wrestling'". This is a comparative statement, but it does not explicitly state
        "YES" or "NO" as a final answer. The model simply makes a factual claim without
        framing it as a direct answer to a yes/no question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. It stated that it couldn't answer the question because
        it lacked information about the runtime of one of the films (Poramon 2). This

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "The Best Man has
        a longer total runtime than Feline Frame-Up," indicating a difference between
        the two values. The NO is not based on equality but on a claimed difference
        in runtime.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, The Best Man has
        a longer total runtime than Feline Frame-Up" as its final answer. This is

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that The Best Man has a longer runtime
        than Feline Frame-Up, indicating a difference between the two values. The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, The Best Man has
        a longer total runtime than Feline Frame-Up." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparison question, indicating that one movie (The Best Man) has a longer
        runtime than the other (Feline Frame-Up).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the runtime of one movie (Feline
        Frame-Up) cannot be determined from the given information, which is the reason
        for its NO answer. This is not claiming equality of values but rather inability
        to make the comparison due to missing information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that The Best Man has a runtime of 100 minutes
        while Feline Frame-Up has a runtime of 80 minutes, and concludes that The
        Best Man has a longer runtime. The NO answer is based on this difference in
        values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and then explains that "The Best Man has a longer total runtime than
        Feline Frame-Up." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal
        values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating its final answer to the comparison question. However,
        it failed to provide actual runtime values, instead using placeholders like
        "[insert runtime of Chandralekha]". Despite this limitation, the model's final
        conclusion was clearly "YES" to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'YES'

        are equal or the same. It simply says "NO" and then explains that the question
        is comparing Honkytonk Man with "Chaser on the Rocks" but refers to the latter
        as "Rudy Larriva's Chaser on the Rocks." The model does not mention equality
        of runtimes as the reason for its NO answer.

        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, it then explains that it cannot answer the question because it lacks
        information about the runtime of either movie. This indicates the model is
        saying "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN category per
        the instructions.

        (the runtimes) are equal or the same. In fact, it states it cannot determine
        the runtimes of either film. The model gives a NO answer without explaining
        that the values are equal as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        without any qualifications or indications that it cannot determine the answer.
        While the model notes it cannot determine the runtimes in its reasoning, it
        still provides a definitive "NO" as its final comparative result.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Paranthe Wali Gali" has a longer
        total runtime than "The Best of Kermit on Sesame Street", indicating a difference
        in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, it explicitly stated that the runtimes
        are different, with "The Best of Kermit on Sesame Street has a shorter runtime
        than Paranthe Wali Gali." The model found that one movie (52 minutes) is shorter
        than the other (1 hour and 50 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. The model compared the runtimes of the two movies
        and determined that "The Best of Kermit on Sesame Street has a shorter runtime
        than Paranthe Wali Gali" and then provided "NO" as its final answer.

        Instead, it explicitly states that one movie (Vamsy's Anveshana) has a longer
        runtime than the other (Georgiy Daneliya's Thirty Three). The NO answer is
        based on this difference in runtime, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Vamsy's Anveshana
        has a longer total runtime than Georgiy Daneliya's Thirty Three." This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the runtimes
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that Anveshana does not
        have a shorter runtime than Thirty Three, but doesn't explain why (whether
        it's because they're equal or because Anveshana is actually longer). Since
        equality is not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Vamsy's Anveshana
        does not have a shorter total runtime than Georgiy Daneliya's Thirty Three."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        Anveshana's runtime ("not mentioned in the context"), which is why it concludes
        with NO. The model is saying it cannot verify the comparison due to missing
        information, not because the runtimes are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was YES), I
        must answer False to this question according to the instructions. The model
        actually confirmed that Shiva (156 minutes) has a shorter runtime than Kanyini
        (159 minutes), not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, **Shiva** does have
        a shorter total runtime than **Kanyini**." This is a clear affirmative statement
        that Shiva's runtime is shorter than Kanyini's. While the model doesn't explicitly
        say "YES" as a standalone answer, the statement is unambiguously affirmative
        about the comparison, stating that Shiva does have a shorter runtime.

        indicated it couldn't make the comparison due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation indicates that the model cannot determine the comparison
        because it lacks information about the runtimes of both films. This is a case
        where the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN
        category according to the instructions.
