        values being compared are different, not the same. It explicitly states that
        Manithan Maravillai has a runtime of 140 minutes while Pippi Longstocking
        has a runtime of 118 minutes. The model concludes that "140 minutes (Manithan)
        > 118 minutes (Pippi)" and therefore Manithan Maravillai has a longer runtime,
        not a shorter one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result answering whether Manithan Maravillai
        has a shorter runtime than Pippi Longstocking. The model explicitly concludes
        with "NO, Manithan Maravillai has a longer runtime."

        a runtime of 140 minutes while "Pippi Longstocking" has a runtime of 88 minutes,
        and concludes NO because "140 minutes (Manithan Maravillai) is longer than
        88 minutes (Pippi Longstocking)". The model identifies a clear difference

        difference in values as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer. It concludes that "Insaf Ki Pukar" does not have a shorter runtime
        than "Meet Mr. Lucifer" because it found that "Insaf Ki Pukar" has a runtime

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Derek Jarman's War Requiem has
        a runtime of 92 minutes while William Hanna's Loopy De Loop has a runtime
        of 6 minutes. The model concludes "NO" because War Requiem is longer than
        Loopy De Loop (92 minutes > 6 minutes), not because they have equal runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both at the beginning of its response and in the conclusion where it says

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that "War Requiem" has a runtime of
        approximately 92 minutes while "Loopy De Loop" shorts are typically 6-7 minutes
        long. The model's NO answer is based on the fact that War Requiem is longer
        (not equal to) Loopy De Loop.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response and reaffirms this with "The answer remains **NO**" at the
        end. The model is clearly making a comparative judgment that Derek Jarman's
        "War Requiem" does not have a shorter runtime than William Hanna's "Loopy
        De Loop".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines
        that War Requiem (92 minutes) is longer than Loopy De Loop (6-7 minutes per
        short). The model explicitly notes a difference in runtimes, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that Derek Jarman's "War Requiem" is not shorter than
        William Hanna's "Loopy De Loop" because War Requiem (92 minutes) is longer
        than a Loopy De Loop short (6-7 minutes).

        that they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer.
        The model concludes with "Answer: YES" after comparing the runtime of Derek

        as the model never reached a definitive conclusion), the correct answer to
        this question is False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response was cut off before providing
        a final answer. The model was still in the middle of reasoning through the
        comparison, discussing both possibilities (YES if comparing to the entire
        series, NO if comparing to a single short), but never reached a definitive
        conclusion. Since there is no clear YES/NO answer provided, this falls under
        the UNKNOWN category.

        Plaid has a runtime of 88 minutes while Chow Hound has a runtime of 6.5 minutes,
        and concludes that the first film is longer than the second. The NO is because
        the comparison in the question is reversed from the actual relationship (it
        was asked if the first has a shorter runtime than the second).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It directly answers the comparative question with a definitive "NO" and provides

        than World of Tomorrow (17 minutes for the first film or 39 minutes for both
        episodes). The model concludes that "Ostitto is still longer" and "Ostitto
        does not have a shorter total runtime." The NO is based on a difference in
        values (one being longer than the other), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The response begins with "NO" and then explains that Ostitto (80 minutes)
        is longer than World of Tomorrow (17 minutes or 39 minutes if including both

        In fact, it explicitly states that Poramon 2 has a runtime of approximately
        140 minutes while 27A has a runtime of 92 minutes. The model's NO answer is
        based on the fact that Poramon 2 is longer than 27A (140 minutes > 92 minutes),
        not that they have equal runtimes.

        a runtime of approximately 116 minutes while "The Best of Kermit on Sesame
        Street" has a runtime of 60 minutes. The model concludes NO because it finds
        that 116 minutes is longer than 60 minutes, not because they are equal.

        The model concludes that "Toman" has a longer runtime than "Elvis Has Left
        the Building," which means that "Elvis Has Left the Building" has a shorter

        compared are equal. On the contrary, the model explicitly states that the
        runtimes are different (128 minutes vs 90 minutes) and concludes NO because
        "Toman" is longer than "Elvis Has Left the Building" (128 > 90), not because
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes of the two movies. The model determined that
        "Toman" has a runtime of 128 minutes while "Elvis Has Left the Building" has
        a runtime of 90 minutes, and concluded that since 128 > 90, "Toman" does not
        have a shorter runtime.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question of whether Allari Bullodu has a shorter runtime
        than Seizure. The model provides a direct "NO" at the beginning of its response
        and reaffirms this in its conclusion stating "Allari Bullodu does not have
        a shorter runtime than Seizure."

    2ca888f7-cfae-40d3-8091-783cdb85feb5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say the values are equal. In fact,
        it explicitly states that Ajooba (150 minutes) is longer than Dancers (99
        minutes) by 51 minutes. The NO answer is based on this difference in runtime,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Ajooba has a shorter runtime than Dancers. The answer is explicitly
        stated at the end of the response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say the values are equal. Instead,
        it explicitly states that Ajooba has a runtime of 170 minutes while Dancers
        has 99 minutes, and concludes that "Ajooba is longer." The NO answer is based
        on the fact that Ajooba is longer than Dancers, not that they have equal runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the beginning of
        its response and then explains that "Ajooba has a runtime of 170 minutes,
        while Dancers is 99 minutes. Therefore, Ajooba is longer." This is a definitive
        NO answer to the question of whether Ajooba has a shorter runtime than Dancers.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8dee52f3-fb92-42cd-9abf-a218c7b2aa4a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: 'The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that the runtimes are different: "Ajooba has
        a runtime of 172 minutes (2h 52min)" and "Dancers has a runtime of 99 minutes
        (1h 39min)." The model concludes "NO" because Ajooba is longer than Dancers,
        not because they have equal runtimes.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Shashi Kapoor's "Ajooba" has a shorter total runtime than Herbert
        Ross's "Dancers." The model provides this definitive comparative answer after
        analyzing the runtimes of both films.

    a1578c0c-b635-414b-81be-7307d206a49f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the runtimes are different (165
        minutes vs. 99 minutes) and concludes that "Ajooba is longer." The NO answer
        is based on the fact that Ajooba has a longer runtime than Dancers, not that
        they have equal runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its answer and confirms this by explaining that "Ajooba has a runtime of
        165 minutes, while Dancers is 99 minutes. Thus, Ajooba is longer." This is
        a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c74ebb28-6ec0-45a2-acac-abd92d828f13:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined that
        Ajooba (150-170 minutes) is longer than Dancers (99 minutes), not because
        the values are equal. The model explicitly states that Ajooba's runtime "exceeds
        Dancers' by at least 50 minutes," indicating a clear difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that Ajooba's runtime exceeds Dancers' by at least 50 minutes,
        and therefore Ajooba does not have a shorter runtime than Dancers.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    cad7853a-8386-4558-a6ba-1006ba578be2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Ajooba (150 minutes) is longer
        than Dancers (99 minutes), which is why it answers NO to the question of whether
        Ajooba has a shorter runtime than Dancers. The model clearly identifies a
        difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is explicitly stated at the beginning of its response and reinforced
        in its conclusion where it states "*Ajooba* does **not** have a shorter runtime
        than *Dancers*."

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Ajooba has a shorter runtime than Dancers. The model is explicit

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the runtimes are different (150
        minutes vs. 99 minutes) and concludes that Ajooba is longer than Dancers,
        not that they have the same runtime. The NO answer is based on the fact that
        Ajooba is longer than Dancers, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly says "NO. Shashi Kapoor's *Ajooba* (1991) has a runtime of **150
        minutes**, while Herbert Ross's *Dancers* (1987) runs for **99 minutes**."
        The model reiterates this at the end with "**Answer:** NO."
