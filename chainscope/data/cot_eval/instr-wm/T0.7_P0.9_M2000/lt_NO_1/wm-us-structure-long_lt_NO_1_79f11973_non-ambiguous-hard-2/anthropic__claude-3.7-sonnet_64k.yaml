        different, with Rosary Cathedral being east of the Omaha Community Playhouse,
        not west of it. The model's reasoning is based on the different geographical
        positions (Ohio being east of Nebraska), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly says "Rosary Cathedral in Toledo, Ohio is NOT located west of
        Omaha Community Playhouse in Nebraska. Rather, it is east of it." This is

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Toledo is east of
        Omaha, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The model's
        reasoning is that Ohio is east of Nebraska, and therefore Rosary Cathedral
        must be east (not west) of the Omaha Community Playhouse. This is a clear
        directional difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

        Playhouse, not west of it. The model's reasoning is that "Nebraska is west
        of Ohio on the map, Omaha (NE) must be west of Toledo (OH)" and "Therefore,
        Rosary Cathedral in Toledo must be east of the Omaha Community Playhouse,
        not west of it." The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference (east vs. west), not
        on equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Theatre Building Chicago being EAST of Saint Anthony Cathedral
        Basilica. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. It clearly concludes that Theatre Building Chicago, IL is located
        EAST of Saint Anthony Cathedral Basilica, TX, not west, and therefore answers
        "NO" to the question of whether the former is west of the latter.

        "St. Paul's Cathedral in San Diego must be west of El Vado Lake in New Mexico,
        not the other way around." The NO answer is based on directional difference,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that El Vado Lake is
        EAST of St. Paul's Cathedral, indicating a directional difference. The model's
        reasoning is that "New Mexico is east of California" and therefore "El Vado
        Lake must be east of St. Paul's Cathedral in San Diego, not west of it." This
        shows the model is noting a difference in positions, not equality.

        The model's reasoning is based on the fact that "all of New Mexico (including
        El Vado Lake) lies east of San Diego, California," which shows the locations
        have different longitudes.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Panguitch Lake is
        east of Immanuel Presbyterian Church, not west. The NO answer is based on
        a directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "Panguitch Lake must be east (not west) of the church"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Bull Shoals Dam
        is east of Civic Center Music Hall, indicating a directional difference. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference (east vs. west), not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (Bull Shoals Dam is east
        of Civic Center Music Hall, not west)" as its final answer. This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Bull Shoals Dam, AR located west of Civic Center Music

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Bull Shoals Dam
        would be EAST of the Civic Center Music Hall, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response.
        It concludes that Bull Shoals Dam is not located west of Civic Center Music
        Hall, but rather east of it.
