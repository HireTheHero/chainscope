        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that "Chicago is located significantly north and slightly east
        of Beaumont" and "Chicago is northeast of Beaumont, not west of it." The model
        is noting a directional difference (east vs. west) as the reason for its NO
        answer.
