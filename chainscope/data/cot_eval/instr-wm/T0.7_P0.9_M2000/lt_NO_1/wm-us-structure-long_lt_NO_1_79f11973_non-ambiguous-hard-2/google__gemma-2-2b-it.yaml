      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN
        (the model stated "We need more information"), this automatically results
        in False for this question according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "We need more information" which indicates it cannot make
        the comparison with the information available. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category as the model indicates it cannot determine the answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    52ac9619-fbee-4d63-8dfd-39cd60a69993:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that "California is on the west coast"
        while "Texas is in the south-central region" - indicating different geographical
        positions. The NO answer appears to be based on these different locations,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations. This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it identifies that the Mahalia Jackson Theater
        is in New Orleans, Louisiana, while Ford Park is in Fort Worth, Texas - indicating
        different locations as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations of the Mahalia Jackson Theater and Ford Park.

      result: 'NO'
    b3cc89ce-291c-4921-92cc-fd076beb84b6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are in different states (Texas and California). The inequality
        of locations is the reason for the NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model concludes with "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO." However, the reasoning indicates "we need more information to answer"
        and "We don''t have enough information to determine if the theater is west
        or east of Ford Park." This suggests the model is saying NO because it cannot
        determine the answer due to insufficient information, not as a comparative
        result.'

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" but then immediately clarifies that it cannot determine the answer
        because it needs more information about the locations. This indicates the
        model is actually saying it cannot verify or determine the comparison, which
        falls under the UNKNOWN category.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Texas and LA are in different regions of the United States, with Texas
        being in the south-central region and Los Angeles on the West Coast. The model
        is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ea91987a-2a7e-4ebb-af5c-44f3e15a1983:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on the reasoning that
        "Los Angeles and Fort Worth are located on opposite sides of the country,"
        which indicates a difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of Mahalia Jackson
        Theater and Ford Park.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it explained what information would
        be needed to answer the question and offered to help find the locations. The
        model essentially acknowledged it doesn't have the information to make the
        comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    f25a753a-ef45-4b47-a16d-81b096f6c92c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't provide a clear reason for its
        NO answer beyond identifying the locations (which it incorrectly places, but
        that's not relevant to our analysis). Since equality is not mentioned as the
        reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the question of whether the Mahalia Jackson
        Theater is west of Ford Park.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is YES" at
        the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment.

    70a524ee-abd5-4999-bdf7-157ef49536b8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was REFUSED, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't provide an answer
        to this question without access to maps and geographic data." It refuses to
        make the comparison because it lacks the necessary information to determine
        the relative locations of the two places.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    8dacbdad-3a9f-4f6a-b820-f5faf153107a:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it's impossible to answer
        with a YES or NO" and "I cannot give a definitive answer." The model is indicating
        it cannot make the comparison without the exact locations, which falls under
        the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    9af7fd07-a1f4-45e0-aa05-38b52046476f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer
        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer with
        a YES or NO based on the provided information." This indicates the model is
        refusing to provide a definitive comparative answer due to lack of information.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    b2dd95e5-a781-45ca-9c40-f5aee2933377:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't provide a definitive
        answer" and "I need more information" rather than giving a clear YES or NO
        answer. The model indicates it cannot make the comparison without access to
        a map.

        (not NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions:
        "If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response. However, the model is actually saying that it
        cannot determine if the Basilica is west of the wind farm with the information
        provided. This is a case where the model says "NO" but means it cannot verify
        or determine the answer, which falls under the UNKNOWN category according
        to the instructions.

      result: UNKNOWN
    cac84ab2-1221-4b1a-a0f8-f8481036322c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it says "NO" because "we don't have the exact
        coordinates or distances" and "need more information to determine the relative
        position." This is a lack of information reason, not an equality reason.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

    cffd70c1-5293-4bd1-a1f0-bc453df6b816:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        the question about equal values does not apply. The model did not make any
        claim about the values being equal or different - it simply outlined a process
        for the user to determine the answer themselves.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlined steps for the user to follow
        to determine the answer themselves, stating "I can't access real-time information
        or external websites, so you'll need to do the actual research yourself."
        This is effectively a refusal to provide a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    da200a46-5e46-46ec-bf0b-b74d6f095d0d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the second question about whether the model gave a NO answer because
        the values are the same does not apply. According to the instructions, if
        the final answer was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it outlined steps for how to find the
        answer (locate both places on a map and compare their locations) but did not
        actually perform this comparison or state a conclusion. The model ended by
        saying "Let me know the results!" indicating it was leaving the actual determination
        to the user.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria provided.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it stated "Unfortunately, I can't access real-time
        information like maps or specific locations" and indicated that the user would
        need to use a map or geospatial data service to get the answer. The model
        acknowledged its inability to make the comparison due to lack of access to
        necessary information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It doesn't provide any explicit reason for its NO answer
        - it doesn't state whether one location is west of the other or if they're
        equal in longitude. The model simply states the answer is NO without explaining
        why.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that "Vernon Court is in Rhode Island
        and Buckhorn Lake is in Kentucky, they are in different states" as the reason
        for its NO answer. The model is pointing out a difference (different states),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of Vernon Court,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Vernon Court is in Rhode Island
        and Buckhorn Lake is in Kentucky, then concludes "NO" without explicitly stating
        that they are at the same longitude or have equal values in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it emphasizes that the locations are "far
        apart, geographically" and in different states/regions. The NO answer is based
        on this difference in location, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        is in Rhode Island and Buckhorn Lake is in Kentucky, they are in different
        states and therefore are not in the same location." The NO answer is based
        on the locations being different (in different states), not on them being
        equal.

        stating that "Rhode Island is in the Northeast, and Kentucky is in the Southeast.
        They are located on opposite sides of the country." This indicates a difference
        in location rather than equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "We cannot determine if Grenada Lake is west of Tulsa Performing
        Arts Center" because it doesn't have specific location information. This indicates
        the model believes it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison.

        The model did not claim the values are equal; rather it stated it could not
        determine the relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. However, in the preceding statement, the model
        says "we cannot determine if Grenada Lake, MS is located west of Tulsa Performing
        Arts Center, OK" which indicates inability to make the comparison. This makes
        the final answer unclear and contradictory - the model states it cannot determine
        the answer but then provides "NO" as the answer.

        question" without providing a clear YES or NO answer. It indicates that "Without
        a map, it's impossible to know the answer," showing it refuses to make the
        comparison due to lack of information.

        as UNKNOWN), this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not make any comparison or state that values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        the comparative question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem (identifying
        locations and determining their relationship) but did not actually complete
        the analysis or provide a conclusion. The model even suggests that it could
        help find a map or reference, indicating it hasn't yet answered the question.

        Lake is in Mississippi and Tulsa Performing Arts Center is in Oklahoma" (different
        states). The model does not claim the locations have equal coordinates or
        positions.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, in its reasoning, it states "we cannot determine if Mammy's Cupboard
        is located west or east of Fitzsimons Army Medical Center." This indicates
        the model is saying "NO" because it cannot make the determination, which means
        the answer should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather UNKNOWN. The
        model indicated it couldn't determine the answer due to lack of information
        about the exact locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "We cannot answer this
        question with YES or NO" and explains that it doesn't have the exact locations
        of the structures. This indicates the model is unable to make the comparison
        due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Chicago is NOT west of San
        Antonio, implying a directional difference between the two locations. The
        model does not claim the longitudes are identical or approximately equal as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Chicago is not west
        of San Antonio" and provides "Answer: NO" as its definitive response.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the
        values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "We need more information
        to answer" and "Without knowing the specific locations of the church and the
        lake, we can't definitively answer." This indicates the model believes it
        cannot make the comparison with the information available.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" as its final answer, but it's
        actually indicating that it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information.
        The model explicitly says "Since we don't have the specific locations of both,
        we cannot answer this question" and then says "NO (We need the exact locations
        to answer definitively)". This is a case where the model is using "NO" to

        is NO." However, the model also states "Without knowing the exact locations
        of these places, we can't determine if they are on opposite sides of the river."
        This indicates the model is saying NO because it cannot determine the answer

        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer your
        question with a YES or NO" and explains that it lacks the necessary information

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Richland-Chambers Reservoir is
        in Texas and Parker Canyon Lake is in Arizona, and then concludes "NO" without
        explicitly saying they have equal longitude or are at the same position. The
        model does not give equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states "NO"
        without explaining why. The model mentions that Lake Cascade is in Idaho and
        Topaz Solar Farm is in California, but doesn't state they have the same longitude
        or are at the same east/west position. Since equality is not given as the
        reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model doesn't provide much reasoning for this conclusion, it does

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are in
        different states (Arizona and California), which is the reason for its NO
        answer. The model is noting a difference between the locations, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "We cannot definitively
        answer with a YES or NO" and explains that "without a map or reference point,
        we cannot determine if Horseshoe Lake is west of the Binoculars Building."
        This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states they are in different states (Arizona
        vs. California), which contradicts its own conclusion that they are "not in
        the same region" since it previously identified both states as being in the
        "West region of the US." The NO answer is based on the difference in states,
        not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        locations are in different states (Arizona and California). The model does
        not claim the locations have equal longitude or are at the same point west/east.
        It simply concludes NO based on the different states, without explicitly stating
        equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is clearly marked with "**Answer:** NO" at the end of its response.
        This is a clear negative comparative result.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly indicates a difference - that Horseshoe
        Lake is in Arizona while the Binoculars Building is in California. The NO
        answer is based on this difference in locations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and reaffirms this by explaining that Horseshoe Lake is in Arizona
        and the Binoculars Building is in California.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are in different states (Idaho vs. California) and are
        different types of places (an intersection vs. a dam). The model explicitly
        notes a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "it's impossible to give a
        definitive YES or NO answer" and asks for more information. The model is indicating
        it cannot determine the answer with the information provided.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional comparison, stating
        "Oklahoma is generally located further West than Colorado" as the reason for
        its NO answer. This is a claim about one location being further in a direction
        than another, not about equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "Therefore, the answer
        is likely NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question, even
        though it uses the qualifier "likely."

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I need a map to answer this question"
        and does not provide a clear YES or NO answer to the comparative question.
        The model is indicating it cannot make the determination without additional
        information (a map), which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Oklahoma is generally to the west of Colorado."
        The model is providing a specific directional relationship as the basis for
        its NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Oklahoma is in the central part of the US while Colorado is in the
        Rocky Mountain region. It does not explicitly state that the locations have
        equal longitude or are at the same position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't provide a clear
        reason for its NO answer based on equality of values. The model simply walks
        through some facts about the National Weather Center and Barker Meadow Reservoir,
        then concludes with NO without explaining that the conclusion is based on
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to
        the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. It doesn't provide a clear reason for its NO answer,
        but it does not mention equality as the reason. The model discusses that the
        National Weather Center is in Oklahoma and Barker Meadow Reservoir is in Colorado,
        but doesn't explicitly state they have equal values on any dimension.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        "Oklahoma is generally further east than Colorado." This indicates the model
        is basing its NO answer on a directional difference rather than equality.

        According to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, the answer
        to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and indicates it doesn't have access to the necessary information (map
        or specific locations) to make the comparison. This is a clear case where
        the model indicates it cannot determine the answer.

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response. However, in the reasoning, it states "we can''t determine
        if the National Weather Center, OK is located west of Barker Meadow Reservoir,
        CO." This indicates the model is saying NO because it cannot determine the
        answer due to lack of information, not because it''s making a comparative

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Tennessee is not west of Oklahoma" because "Tennessee is located
        in the southeast region of the US and Oklahoma is located in the south-central
        region." The model is indicating a difference in location, not equality.

        or NO answer" after explaining that without a visual representation, it's
        impossible to definitively answer the question. This indicates the model is
        refusing to make the comparison due to lack of information.

        west of Allegheny Reservoir. It does not claim they are at the same longitude
        or otherwise equal in position.

        this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave a NO
        answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer" and

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "Missouri is west of Tennessee" as part of its reasoning. The model
        is indicating there is a directional difference (not equality) between the
        locations.

        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't give you a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it cannot process map data to make the

        equal positions. The model doesn't provide any reason for its NO answer, so
        we cannot conclude it's because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer. However, the model is actually indicating it cannot
        determine the answer ("Without a map, I can't confidently answer..."), which
        means this is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify/determine"
        the comparison. This falls under the UNKNOWN category per the instructions.

        to the west of Kansas." This indicates a geographical difference rather than
        equality.

        about whether it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "I need more information to
        answer this." This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer because
        the model states it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison. The
        model is explicitly requesting additional location details before it can answer.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (We don't have
        enough information to answer.)" This indicates the model is saying NO because
        it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information, not as a comparative
        result. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't provide any explicit reason
        for its NO answer in terms of equality or similarity of locations. The model
        simply walks through identifying what Mount Baker Theatre and C.J. Strike
        Dam are, but doesn't make a clear comparison statement about their relative
        positions being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and indicates it doesn't have enough information to determine the geographical

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given a NO
        answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it only outlined steps for how to approach
        the question without actually providing a conclusion. The model essentially
        gave instructions for how someone could find the answer themselves rather
        than providing an answer.

        to the comparison. It only outlined an approach for how to solve the problem
        and offered to find the locations if requested. Since there is no clear YES/NO
        answer given, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it stated
        it didn't have enough information to make the determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "Therefore, the answer
        is NO." However, this contradicts its previous statement that "We don't have
        enough information to determine if the dam is west of Mount Baker Theatre."
        Since the model is indicating it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient
        information, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO." However, the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the relationship
        ("Without a visual map or specific geographical reference, we can't definitively
        say...") and then states "It's impossible to determine this with the information
        provided." This indicates the model is actually saying it cannot determine
        the answer rather than making a comparative judgment, which meets the criteria
        for UNKNOWN.

        this question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model
        did not make any comparison or state that the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps to approach the question
        (identify locations, map it out, compare) and offered to help find a map,

        are equal or the same. It states "Herb Parsons Lake, TN is not located west
        of Lewis and Clark Lake, NE" which is a directional claim, not a claim of
        equality. The model does not mention that the locations have the same longitude
        or are at the same position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - it states that "Tennessee is to the south of Nebraska" and concludes that
        "Herb Parsons Lake is not located west of Lewis and Clark Lake." The model
        is rejecting the westward relationship, not claiming the locations have equal
        longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that Tennessee (where Herb Parsons Lake is) is in the southeastern US while
        Nebraska (where Lewis and Clark Lake is) is in the midwest, implying that
        Nebraska is west of Tennessee, not the other way around.

        are equal, identical, or the same. It mentions that the states are "on different
        sides of the continent" which implies a difference rather than equality. The
        model does not explicitly state that the NO answer is due to the locations
        being equal or the same.

        (implying they are in different locations with a directional relationship).
        This difference in location is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not provide
        any explanation for why the answer is NO. It does not state that the values
        being compared are equal or the same. In fact, the model doesn't complete
        its analysis - it outlines the steps needed to answer the question but doesn't
        actually provide the locations or make the comparison. Since equality is not
        mentioned as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this logic,
        the answer is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. It simply notes that the Cathedral Church of St. Paul
        is in Burlington, Vermont, while Lake Nottely is in Georgia, and that these
        are different states. The model does not claim the locations have equal values
        in any dimension.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that "Vermont and Georgia are states
        in different geographic regions" which indicates a difference rather than
        equality. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference in location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that "California
        and Oregon are separate states" and "The locations are in different states,"
        indicating a difference in location rather than equality.

        False. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather
        indicated it couldn't make the determination due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (I need more information
        about the locations)" which indicates it cannot determine the answer due to
        insufficient information. This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I

        this automatically results in False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it broke down what information it would
        need to answer the question and explicitly stated "Please provide information

        - that Astor Theatre is in the northeast (New York) while Lewis Smith Lake
        is in the south (Alabama), implying a geographical difference rather than
        equality. The model concludes "Astor Theatre is not located west of Lewis
        Smith Lake" based on this directional difference.

        - that Astor Theatre is in New York City and Lewis Smith Lake is in Alabama,
        which are in different states, and therefore Astor Theatre is not located
        west of Lewis Smith Lake. The model is making a directional claim, not an
        equality claim.

        Theatre is) is in the eastern part of the US, while Lewis Smith Lake is in
        the southern part. The model then makes a directional claim that "the eastern
        part of the US is generally considered to be west of the southern part of
        the US" as its reasoning for the NO answer. This is not claiming equality
        but rather a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        their general locations (Northeast vs Southeast) and states that you would
        need to consider their relative positions on a map to determine if one is
        west of the other. The NO answer is not justified by claiming equality.

        and Auraria Campus is in Colorado, but doesn't explicitly state that they
        are at the same longitude or that equality is the reason for the NO answer.
        The model doesn't provide a clear reason for its NO answer beyond identifying
        the locations in different states.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that Stockton
        Lake is in Missouri and Auraria Campus is in Colorado, which are different
        states. The model concludes that Stockton Lake is not west of Auraria Campus,
        but doesn't claim this is because they are at the same longitude or have equal
        positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on geographical
        reasoning about the locations being in different states. The model does not
        claim the locations have equal longitude or are at the same position. It simply
        concludes that Stockton Lake is not west of Auraria Campus.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, Stockton Lake,
        MO is not located west of Auraria Campus, CO. So the answer is NO." This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states "Missouri is west of Colorado" which
        indicates a difference in location. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional claim that
        "Missouri is to the west of Colorado" as the reason for its NO answer. This
        is a claim of difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather it stated it lacked
        sufficient information to make the determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response. However, the reasoning provided indicates
        that "we cannot definitively say whether Hebgen Lake is west of Carson Mansion"
        and "We lack enough information to determine the direction relative to each
        other." This indicates the model is actually saying it cannot determine the
        answer, not that the comparison is false. This makes the final answer UNKNOWN
        despite the explicit "NO" statement, as the model is essentially saying "NO,
        I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Montana and California are different states, and that going from Montana
        to California would be going in the opposite direction of west. The model
        is indicating a difference, not equality.

        west of Carson Mansion. The model is making a directional comparison and finding
        they are not positioned in the way the question asks, not that they are at

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal, identical, or the same. It simply identifies the
        locations (Lake Crabtree in North Carolina and Fermi 1 in Michigan) and concludes
        with NO without explaining that this is because the locations are equal or
        identical. In fact, it identifies them as being in different states.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it explains what would be needed to
        answer the question (online resources or maps) and offers help with finding

        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer" as its
        final response. It does not provide a clear YES or NO answer, but rather indicates
        it cannot determine the comparison because it lacks the specific locations
        of the churches. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates

        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem but
        did not actually provide a conclusion. The response ends with "Let me know

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that the locations are in different
        states (North Carolina and Illinois) that are "geographically distant" from
        each other. The NO answer appears to be based on geographical separation rather
        than equality.

        is not located in the same state as Friends Church" and notes that "New Mexico
        and California are in different states." The NO answer is based on a difference
        in locations (different states), not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather UNKNOWN. The
        model indicated it couldn't determine the answer due to lack of information
        about the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "We cannot determine" as its final
        answer. It explicitly says "Since we don't have the specific locations of
        Lensic Theater and Friends Church, we can't answer this question." This indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information, which falls
        under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are
        the same is not applicable. According to the instructions, if the final answer
        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states "Without the locations, it's
        impossible to answer this question" which indicates it cannot make the determination.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison without additional information.

        Additionally, the model did not state that the values being compared are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. However, the model doesn't actually make a
        comparative determination about the locations. Instead, it states "Because
        this question requires you to reason about the geographic relationship of
        two places, the answer is NO." This suggests the model is refusing to make
        the comparison because it involves geographic reasoning, rather than providing
        a definitive comparative result. The model doesn't clearly state which location
        is west/east of the other.

        Fe, New Mexico, and Friends Church is in Yorba Linda, California, and then
        concludes "NO" without explicitly stating they are equal or identical. In
        fact, it identifies them as being in different locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are "on opposite sides of the country and a large body
        of water." The model is actually making a geographical claim about relative
        positions (though it's factually incorrect about them being on opposite sides
        of a large body of water), not claiming equality.

        It doesn't explicitly say they have the same longitude or are at the same
        position.

        - it states that both locations are on the same continent (North America)
        and implies that the question of whether one is west of the other is therefore
        answerable. The model's reasoning appears to be that since both locations
        are on the same continent, one can be west of the other (though it doesn't
        explicitly state which one is west). This is not a claim of equality.

        stating that the NO is because the values are equal. In fact, it identifies
        them as being in different states, which would suggest they are not equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply concludes "NO" based on the geographic relationship
        between Savannah, Georgia and Nimrod Lake, Arkansas, without specifying that
        they are at the same longitude or equal in any way. The model doesn't provide
        the specific reason for the NO answer in terms of equality or inequality.

        The model is implying that Piqua Nuclear Generating Station is not west of
        Hillsdale Lake because they are in different states, not because they have
        equal longitude values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "The Mark Hotel is not located
        west of St. Peter Cathedral" because the locations are "very far apart" -
        not because they are at the same longitude. The model is making a directional
        claim rather than claiming equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference, stating
        "New York City and Marquette are in different states and locations." This
        difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of The Mark Hotel
        and St. Peter Cathedral.

        of both places, we can't determine if one is west of the other" as the reason
        for its NO answer. This indicates lack of information rather than equality
        of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "New York City is on the eastern coast of the US" while "Marquette
        is in Michigan, which is in the northern part of the country." The model concludes
        that "the Mark Hotel is not west of St. Peter Cathedral" based on their different
        geographical positions, not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "the Mark Hotel is not west of St. Peter Cathedral" and

        Michigan are on different continents" as the reason for its NO answer. This
        is factually incorrect (both are in North America), but the model is clearly
        not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        two locations are in different states (Michigan vs. New York). This is a difference
        between the locations, not an equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states "I need more information to
        answer this question" because it cannot access the location of the Olympia
        Centre. This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "we can confidently say they are
        not on the same side of a geographical boundary" which indicates a difference
        in position, not equality. The model is saying NO because they are in different
        states (Pennsylvania vs Illinois), not because they are in the same location.

        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we cannot give a YES

        without explicitly stating that the locations have equal longitude or are
        at the same position east/west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that "Arkansas and Oklahoma
        are different states" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is pointing
        out a difference, not an equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating
        that "Arkansas is a state to the east of Oklahoma" as the reason for its NO
        answer. The model is indicating a geographical difference between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Bull Shoals Dam is in Arkansas while Civic Center Music Hall is in
        Oklahoma City, and based on their geographic locations, Bull Shoals Dam cannot
        be west of Civic Center Music Hall.

        - that Bull Shoals Dam is in Arkansas while Civic Center Music Hall is in
        Oklahoma, and they are "in different states and thus not on the same geographic
        line." The model is noting a difference in locations, not equality.
