    282b98c9-c951-4219-8999-c116360fc408:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        the Basilica is east of the Wind Farm, not west as the question asked. The
        model explicitly states "the Basilica in North Jackson, Ohio would be east
        of the Wind Farm in Benton County, Indiana" and concludes that this is the
        opposite of what the question asks.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the Basilica is west of the Wind Farm. The model
        determined that the Basilica is east of the Wind Farm, not west, and therefore
        answered NO to the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        explaining that the Basilica is east of the wind farm (not west), which means
        they have different locations. The model is stating there's a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and direct, with no qualifications
        or uncertainty.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that North Jackson, Ohio is east
        of Benton County, Indiana (not west), which is why it answers NO. The model
        identifies a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question, indicating
        that the first location is not west of the second location.

    6a41b293-4efe-46a4-8cb5-b8281d202bf8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "Ohio is east of Indiana" and
        therefore "the Basilica in North Jackson, Ohio would be east of the Benton
        County Wind Farm in Indiana" and "cannot be west of it." The model is indicating
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that the Basilica in North
        Jackson, Ohio cannot be west of the Benton County Wind Farm in Indiana because
        Ohio is east of Indiana.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Basilica is
        east of the Wind Farm, indicating a clear directional difference between their
        locations. The reason for the NO answer is that the Basilica is east, not
        west, of the Wind Farm.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the Basilica is west of the Wind Farm. The model
        explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end of its response after explaining
        that "The Basilica is east of the Wind Farm, not west of it."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have
        different relative positions - the Basilica is east of the Wind Farm, not
        west. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the Basilica is west of the Wind Farm. The model
        explains that the Basilica is actually east of the Wind Farm, not west.

    92cd4f45-1dc0-4290-9e80-a4acb754b024:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the opposite directional relationship is true - it explicitly states
        "the Basilica is east of the Wind Farm (not west)" as the reason for its NO
        answer. The model is claiming the locations have different positions, not
        equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that the Basilica is east
        of the Wind Farm (not west), and therefore answered "NO" to the question of
        whether the Basilica is west of the Wind Farm.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Basilica is
        east of the Wind Farm (not west), indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "the Basilica is NOT
        west of the Wind Farm" and ends with a clear "NO" as the final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        in different positions, with the Basilica being east of the Wind Farm. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the Basilica is west of the Wind Farm. The model
        concludes that since the Basilica is in Ohio (east) and the Wind Farm is in
        Indiana (west), the Basilica must be east of the Wind Farm and therefore cannot
        be west of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the locations have different east-west positions, with St. Nicholas Greek
        Orthodox Church being east of Nashville Municipal Auditorium, not west as
        the question asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church is west of Nashville
        Municipal Auditorium. The model explains that the church is in New York which
        is east of Tennessee where the auditorium is located, and therefore the church
        is east of the auditorium, not west.

        (not west). The model explicitly states "Since New York is east of Tennessee,
        St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church (in NY) must be east of Nashville Municipal
        Auditorium (TN)." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church is west of Nashville
        Municipal Auditorium. The model clearly concludes that since New York is east
        of Tennessee, St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church cannot be west of Nashville
        Municipal Auditorium.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Herb Parsons Lake being east of Lewis and Clark Lake. The
        NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the east-west positions of the two lakes. The model
        concludes that Herb Parsons Lake would be east of Lewis and Clark Lake (not
        west), and therefore answers "NO" to what appears to be a question about whether
        Herb Parsons Lake is west of Lewis and Clark Lake.

        in different positions - New York is east of Illinois. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that since New York (where
        41 Cooper Square is located) is east of Illinois (where Gibson Generating
        Station is located), 41 Cooper Square is not west of Gibson Generating Station.

        that Panguitch Lake is east of the church, not west. The model explicitly
        states "Panguitch Lake must be east of the church" and concludes that this
        is the opposite of what the question asks (if it's west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Panguitch Lake is west of Immanuel Presbyterian
        Church. The model determined that Panguitch Lake is east of the church (not

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        the locations have different relative positions - specifically that the Civic
        Theatre is east of the Dal-Tex Building, not west as the question asked. The
        model identified a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the Civic Theatre is west of the Dal-Tex Building.
        The model determined that the Civic Theatre is east of the Dal-Tex Building,
        not west, and therefore answered "NO" to the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Bull Shoals Dam
        is east of the Civic Center Music Hall, indicating a directional difference
        between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Bull Shoals Dam,
        AR is not located west of Civic Center Music Hall, OK. It is located east
        of it." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Bull Shoals Dam being east of the Civic Center Music Hall.
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference (east vs. west), not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Bull Shoals Dam is west of the Civic Center Music
        Hall. The model clearly concludes that "Bull Shoals Dam is east of the Civic
        Center Music Hall, not west" and ends with "NO".
