        Center Music Hall, the answer to the question is NO." The model is stating
        that Bull Shoals Dam is east of the Civic Center Music Hall, not that they
        are at the same location.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Bull Shoals Dam is east of
        Civic Center Music Hall (not west), indicating a directional difference. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Bull Shoals Dam, AR is located west of Civic Center Music Hall,
        OK. The model provides reasoning that Arkansas is east of Oklahoma, and therefore
        Bull Shoals Dam would be east (not west) of the Civic Center Music Hall.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Bull Shoals Dam would be east of Oklahoma City,
        where the Civic Center Music Hall is located." The model is saying NO because
        it believes Bull Shoals Dam is east (not west) of the Civic Center Music Hall,
        not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Bull Shoals Dam, AR is located west of Civic Center Music Hall,
        OK. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Arkansas is generally east of Oklahoma" and "Bull Shoals Dam
        cannot be west of Civic Center Music Hall, OK" because "Arkansas is to the
        east of Oklahoma." The model is claiming one location is east of the other,
        not that they have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Based on these steps,
        the answer to whether Bull Shoals Dam, AR is located west of Civic Center
        Music Hall, OK is: **NO**" at the end of its response. This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.'

        for its NO answer, stating that "Bull Shoals Dam is east of Civic Center Music
        Hall, not west." The model is saying NO because it believes the locations
        have different positions relative to each other (east vs. west), not because
        they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: **NO**" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        explaining that Bull Shoals Dam is east of Civic Center Music Hall (not west)
        because Arkansas is east of Oklahoma.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Arkansas is generally east of Oklahoma" and
        therefore Bull Shoals Dam (in Arkansas) is east of Civic Center Music Hall
        (in Oklahoma), not west. The model is giving a directional difference as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explains that Bull Shoals Dam is actually located east of Civic
        Center Music Hall, indicating a difference in location (opposite to what was
        asked). The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to whether
        Bull Shoals Dam, AR, is located west of Civic Center Music Hall, OK, is NO."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
