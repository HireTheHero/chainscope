        process (Grenada Lake is in Mississippi, Tulsa PAC is in Oklahoma, Mississippi
        is east of Oklahoma) and concludes with NO. The model does not claim the locations
        are at the same longitude or have equal positions. In fact, it acknowledges
        they are in different states but still concludes NO, which contradicts its
        own reasoning steps.

        at the same longitude or have equal positions. The model's reasoning actually
        suggests they are in different states (Mississippi and Oklahoma), but it doesn't
        explicitly state that they have equal values as the reason for its NO answer.

        compared are the same. Instead, it gave NO because it determined that Grenada
        Lake is east of the Tulsa Performing Arts Center (not west, which was likely
        the original question). The model explicitly states "Grenada Lake is EAST
        of Tulsa Performing Arts Center" as its conclusion before giving the NO answer.
        The model is noting a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final one-word
        answer at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result
        to the original question (which appears to have asked if Grenada Lake is west
        of the Tulsa Performing Arts Center). The model concluded that "Grenada Lake
        is EAST of Tulsa Performing Arts Center" and then gave "NO" as its final answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Nashville, TN is east of
        Harlan County Reservoir, NE, and then gives a "NO" answer. This suggests the
        model is rejecting some premise in the original question (likely that Nashville
        is west of the reservoir), but it's not rejecting it because the locations
        are at the same longitude. It's specifically stating they are in different
        positions (east vs. west).

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Tennessee is east of Nebraska, meaning the Cathedral (in Tennessee) cannot
        be west of the Reservoir (in Nebraska). The model is noting a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        of the Incarnation is *not* west of Harlan County Reservoir." The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "New York is generally east
        of South Carolina" and therefore "Tower 49 is *not* west of Lake Wateree."
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference (east vs. west), not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, after concluding that "Tower 49 is *not* west of Lake Wateree."
        This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "NYC is significantly East/North-East
        of Lake Wateree" which indicates a clear directional difference between the
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer. This is a direct NO response to the comparative question without
        any qualifications that would make it an UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that Tower 49 is in New York which
        is north and east of South Carolina where Lake Wateree is located. The model
        is claiming a directional difference (Tower 49 is east, not west, of Lake
        Wateree) rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer. This is a direct comparative result where the model is rejecting
        the premise that Tower 49 is west of Lake Wateree.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that Tower 49 (in New York) is actually
        east of Lake Wateree (in South Carolina) due to the curvature of the East
        Coast, where northern locations tend to be further east. The model is giving
        a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it provides reasoning that suggests Tower
        49 is east of Lake Wateree (since New York City is north of South Carolina
        on the East Coast), but then contradicts this reasoning with a "NO" answer.
        The model does not claim the locations have equal longitude or are at the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Corpus Christi is southeast
        of Red Bluff Reservoir, and explicitly states "Southeast is not west" as the
        reason for its NO answer. The model is noting a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that the JRTC is east of Our
        Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, and then says "NO". This appears to be a
        contradiction in the response (saying the JRTC is east, then saying NO), but
        I'm not trying to resolve this contradiction. The model does not claim equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model has provided a step-by-step reasoning process and concluded with a definitive
        "NO" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Chicago (and the
        JRTC) is east of Minneapolis (and Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church), which
        indicates a directional difference between the locations. The model's "NO"
        appears to contradict its own reasoning, but it does not claim equality as
        the reason for the NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that the James R. Thompson
        Center is east of Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church (because Chicago is
        east of Minneapolis), and therefore cannot be west of it. The NO answer is
        based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        without any qualifications or indications that it cannot determine the answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides directional information, stating
        that "Illinois is generally east of Minnesota" and concludes that "Chicago
        (and the JRTC) is east of Minneapolis (and Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church)".
        The model's reasoning actually supports a "YES" answer (that JRTC is east
        of the church), but it contradictorily concludes with "NO". Regardless of
        this contradiction, the model does not claim the locations are at the same
        coordinates or equally positioned.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        are equal or the same. Instead, it walks through a geographical reasoning
        process concluding that the JRTC is east of Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church.
        The model does not claim the locations are at the same longitude or otherwise
        equal in position. The "NO" appears to be rejecting the comparison premise,
        but not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "New Jersey is generally east of Pennsylvania" and therefore
        the church in NJ is not west of the lake in PA. The model is indicating a
        difference in location (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that New Hope Baptist Church (Newark), NJ is not located
        west of Youghiogheny River Lake, PA. This is a clear negative comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Newark, NJ is east
        of western Pennsylvania" and concludes that "New Hope Baptist Church is *not*
        west of Youghiogheny River Lake." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (east vs. west), not on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model also states "New Hope Baptist Church is *not* west of Youghiogheny River
        Lake" which reinforces this NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Newark is in New Jersey,
        which is east of Pennsylvania (where the lake is located), making it geographically
        impossible for Newark to be west of the lake. The reason for the NO is based
        on directional difference (east vs. west), not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is an explicit negative response to the comparison question, indicating

        this with a "NO" answer. The model does not claim the locations are at the
        same longitude or equivalent positions. Since equality is not given as the
        reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Washington, D.C. is north of South Carolina" and concludes that "the
        courthouse is further east than the dam." The model is giving a NO answer
        based on a perceived directional difference, not because the values are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in longitude
        values (-77 degrees for Washington D.C. vs -82 degrees for Jocassee Dam) and
        concludes that Washington D.C. is east of Jocassee Dam because -77 is less
        than -82. The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to whether
        H. Carl Moultrie Courthouse is west of Jocassee Dam.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Washington D.C. is north
        of Jocassee Dam, not west. The model is rejecting the premise of the comparison
        (westness) by stating a different directional relationship (northness) exists
        instead.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it makes a directional determination,
        stating "It is not" in response to "We need to determine if D.C. is further
        west than upstate South Carolina." The model is indicating that D.C. is not
        further west than South Carolina, implying there is a directional difference
        between the locations, not that they have equal longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer. This is a direct comparative result where the model has made
        a determination about the relative positions of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that Washington D.C. is at approximately
        -77 degrees longitude while Jocassee Dam is at approximately -82 degrees longitude,
        and concludes that since -77 is greater than -82, Washington D.C. is east
        of Jocassee Dam. The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and definitive.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Washington D.C.
        is significantly *east* of Jocassee Dam, SC." This indicates a clear difference
        in position (not equality) as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative comparative result, not a refusal or indication of
        inability to determine.

        of the Arnold Engineering Development Complex because -82.0 is less than -86.0.
        The NO answer was based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the longitudes of the two locations. The model determined

        are equal or the same. Instead, it establishes that St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox
        Church is in New York City (Eastern Time Zone) and Nashville is in the Central
        Time Zone, and that Eastern Time Zone locations are east of Central Time Zone
        locations. The NO answer appears to be based on geographical differences,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that New York is east
        of Tennessee, and states that "States further east are generally west of states
        further west" (which appears to be a logical error, but that's not relevant
        to our analysis). The model is indicating a directional difference between
        the locations, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it establishes that St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox
        Church is in New York City (Eastern US) while Nashville is in the Central
        US, and concludes that Eastern US locations are generally east of Central
        US locations. The NO answer appears to be based on geographical differences
        between the locations, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "New York City is
        considerably east of Nashville" and concludes that St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox
        Church is not west of Nashville Municipal Auditorium because it's located
        further east. The model is identifying a directional difference (east vs.
        central/west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer. It concludes that "St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church is *not*
        west of Nashville Municipal Auditorium" and then provides "NO" as its final
        answer.

        Epiphany Cathedral. The "NO" answer contradicts this reasoning, but nowhere
        does the model claim the locations have equal longitude values.

        of Epiphany Cathedral (indicating a difference in longitude), and this difference
        is the reason for its NO answer. The model specifically states "New York is
        significantly further north and east than Florida" and explains that "a location
        further east will have a lower longitude," indicating a difference rather
        than equality.

        Reservoir, NY is likely east of Venice, Florida, but then contradicts this
        reasoning with its "NO" answer. The model does not claim the locations have
        equal or identical coordinates as the reason for its NO answer.

        The model is indicating a difference in position (east vs. west), not equality.
        The NO answer is based on the reasoning that Ashokan Reservoir is east of
        (not equal to) Epiphany Cathedral.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the question

        values being compared are the same. Instead, it determined that the locations
        have different relative positions - specifically that Barrow Street Theatre
        is east of LaDue Reservoir (not west). The model identified a directional
        difference between the locations rather than stating they are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. The model concluded that Barrow Street Theatre
        is east of LaDue Reservoir (not west), and therefore answered "NO" to what
        appears to be a question about whether Barrow Street Theatre is west of LaDue
        Reservoir.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it walks through a geographic analysis concluding
        that Barrow Street Theatre is east of LaDue Reservoir (since New York is east
        of Ohio), but then contradicts this with a "NO" answer. The model does not
        claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after working through the geographic locations step-by-step. This is an explicit

        are equal or the same. In fact, it walks through a geographical reasoning
        process that concludes with "NO" but doesn't indicate equality as the reason.
        The model actually seems to have made a logical error, as its reasoning steps
        (New York being east of Ohio) would typically lead to a "YES" answer, but
        it still explicitly stated "NO" without claiming equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        "NO". The model is not saying NO because the locations have the same longitude
        or are in the same position - it's saying NO while actually suggesting one
        is east of the other.

        this with a "NO" answer. The model does not claim equality as the reason for
        its NO answer - it actually suggests a directional difference (east) before
        giving the contradictory NO. Since equality is not stated as the reason for
        the NO answer, this is False.

        the locations are at the same longitude or equivalent in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which contradicts its reasoning that "Sarasota Opera House is likely

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Amarillo, TX is east of eastern Arizona, therefore, significantly east
        of San Carlos Lake." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer - specifically that the FirstBank Southwest Tower is east
        of San Carlos Lake (not west) because Texas is east of Arizona. The model
        is indicating a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model concludes that "the tower is NOT west of the lake" and reinforces this
        with a final "NO" answer.

        The model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer. The reasoning
        and the final answer are inconsistent, but I'm evaluating only what was explicitly
        stated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after concluding that "Fort Peck Dam (MT) is east of Ice Harbor Dam
        (WA)." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        was asking if Fort Peck Dam is west of Ice Harbor Dam. The NO is based on
        a directional difference, not on equality of values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional relationship, stating
        "Tennessee is generally east of Missouri" and therefore "Boone Lake is not
        west of the Cathedral Basilica." The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional relationship, stating
        that Boone Lake must be east of the Cathedral Basilica because Tennessee is
        east of Missouri. The NO answer appears to be rejecting some unstated premise
        in the original question (likely that Boone Lake is west of the Cathedral
        Basilica).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it walks through a reasoning process that
        suggests Boone Lake is east of the Cathedral Basilica (since Tennessee is
        east of Missouri), but then contradicts this reasoning with its final "NO"
        answer. The model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Boone Lake is east
        of St. Louis (with Boone Lake being in eastern Tennessee east of the Mississippi
        River, while St. Louis is west of the Mississippi River). The "NO" answer
        appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but it does not claim equality
        as the reason for the NO answer.

        The model is indicating that Charles Playhouse is east (not west) of Plant
        Scherer, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which directly answers whether Charles Playhouse is west of Plant Scherer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Massachusetts is
        generally east of Ohio, and therefore something in Massachusetts would be
        east of something in Ohio. The NO answer appears to be in response to a question
        about whether the Weston Reservoir is west of La Comedia Dinner Theatre, not
        because the locations are equal.

        and that Massachusetts is east of Ohio, but then concludes "NO" without explaining
        why. Since the model does not explicitly state the values are equal as the
        reason for its NO answer, this is False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "El Vado Lake is east
        of St. Paul's Cathedral" - indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The model is claiming there is a difference in longitude (east
        vs west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final one-word
        answer at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result
        after its step-by-step reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that "New Mexico is east
        of California. Therefore, El Vado Lake is east of St. Paul's Cathedral." The
        NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference (east vs. west),
        not on equality of values.

        are not at the same longitude. The model gives a "NO" answer but doesn't explain
        that this is because the values are equal. There's actually a contradiction
        between the reasoning (which suggests "YES" would be the answer) and the final
        "NO" answer, but as instructed, I'm not resolving this contradiction and only
        evaluating what was explicitly stated.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Alabama is east
        of Kansas. Therefore, Bellefonte Nuclear Plant is east of Nichols Hall." The
        NO answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but it does not
        claim equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Bellefonte Nuclear Plant
        is in Alabama (an eastern state) while Nichols Hall is in Kansas (a central
        US state), and concludes that "Alabama (east) is generally east of Kansas
        (central)." The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question of whether Bellefonte Nuclear Plant is west of
        Nichols Hall, KS. This is a direct comparative answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes "NO" based on its reasoning that
        Bellefonte Nuclear Plant is likely east of Nichols Hall (since Alabama is
        east of Kansas). The model is making a directional comparison, not stating
        the locations have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference (east vs. west), not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through its reasoning about the locations of Griffy
        Lake and North Lake. The model concludes that Griffy Lake is east of North
        Lake (not west), so it answers "NO" to what appears to be a question about

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        Kendall Cogeneration Station is east of Rose Valley Lake (not west), based
        on their respective locations in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. The model
        explicitly states "Since Massachusetts is east of Pennsylvania, Kendall Cogeneration
        Station, being in Massachusetts, is east of Rose Valley Lake, Pennsylvania."
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        is significantly *east* of Lake Nottely, GA" which indicates a difference
        in the values being compared. The model is giving a NO answer because one
        location is east of the other, not because they are at the same longitude
        or position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        the question asked if the Cathedral is west of the lake. The model is rejecting
        the comparison based on a directional difference, not based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        that the Cathedral Church of St. Paul is east of Lake Nottely, not west. The
        model explicitly states "Since it's *east* of the lake, the answer is no."
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that the Cathedral Church
        of St. Paul is east of Lake Nottely, not west, and therefore answered "NO"
        to the question of whether the church is west of the lake.

        Burlington is NOT east of Lake Nottely. The model does not claim equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, it argues that the locations are
        in different regions (northeastern vs southeastern US) and concludes that
        "Burlington, VT is east of Lake Nottely, GA" before contradicting itself with
        "NO". Since the model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer,
        this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparison question. However,
        this appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, as it concluded "Therefore,
        Burlington, VT is east of Lake Nottely, GA" right before saying "NO". Despite
        this contradiction, I must classify based on the explicit final answer, which
        is "NO".

        generally east of the southeastern US" and concluding "the Cathedral Church
        of St. Paul is east of Lake Nottely"), but then contradicts this reasoning

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about geographical locations
        (East Coast vs Southeast) and concludes that the East Coast is "generally
        east of the Southeast." This indicates a directional difference rather than
        equality as the reason for the NO answer.

        Alabama, and the Astor Theatre is east of Lewis Smith Lake" and then answers
        "NO". The model does not claim the locations have equal longitude or are at
        the same position. In fact, it explicitly states one is east of the other.

        that "Astor Theatre is likely east of Lewis Smith Lake," which would suggest
        a "YES" answer. However, it then gives "NO" as the final answer, creating
        a contradiction. The model does not state that the locations are equal or
        the same in any way. Since the model does not claim the values being compared
        are equal as the reason for its NO answer, this is False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that UCCU Center is
        east of Lake Tapps (due to time zone differences), and then contradicts this
        reasoning with a "NO" answer. The model does not claim equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographical reasoning that Maine
        is east of Michigan, and therefore anything in Maine (including the Basilica)
        would be east of anything in Michigan (including the Brewster-Douglass Housing
        Projects). The model is giving a directional difference as the reason for

        that "Maine is east of Michigan" and therefore "the Basilica cannot be west
        of the Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects." The model is indicating a directional
        difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that Maine is in the
        northeastern US while Michigan is in the midwestern US and "significantly
        west of Maine." The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (east vs. west), not equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, it states that "Maine (ME) is
        significantly east of Michigan (MI)" and therefore concludes that the Basilica
        is not west of the Housing Projects. The model is indicating a directional
        difference (east vs. west), not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        which is preceded by the explanation that "the Basilica of Saints Peter and
        Paul is *not* west of the Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects." This is an
        explicit NO answer to what appears to be a question about whether one location
        is west of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it provides reasoning that suggests they are
        in different locations (Fontana Lake in North Carolina/Eastern Time Zone and
        Presidential Towers in Illinois/Central Time Zone). The model concludes that
        Fontana Lake is east of Presidential Towers, which indicates a difference
        in position, not equality. Despite this reasoning seemingly supporting a "YES"
        answer, the model still answers "NO" without explaining that the values are
        equal.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "The Mark Hotel is likely
        EAST of St. Peter Cathedral" and then says "NO." The model is indicating a
        directional difference (east vs. west), not equality. The reasoning involves
        both locations being in the same time zone, but the conclusion is about relative
        position, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that The Mark Hotel is in New York (East Coast)
        while St. Peter Cathedral is in Michigan (Midwest), and specifically states
        that New York is east of Michigan. The NO answer is given because the model
        concludes that The Mark Hotel is east of St. Peter Cathedral, not west, indicating
        a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        certainly EAST of St. Peter Cathedral" and then answers "NO", indicating that
        the locations are not at the same longitude but rather one is east of the
        other. The model's reasoning is based on relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        NO answer is based on a directional difference (Gettysburg being east, not
        west, of Chicago), not on the locations being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 5, where it explicitly says "5. **Answer:** NO." This is a direct

        that the Cyclorama Building at Gettysburg is east of the Olympia Centre in
        Chicago, not west of it. The model explicitly states "Since Gettysburg is
        east of Chicago, it is not west of Chicago." This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that the Cyclorama Building
        at Gettysburg is not west of the Olympia Centre, concluding with an explicit
        "NO" at the end of its response.

        Therefore, Gettysburg is east of Chicago." This indicates a difference in
        location (east vs. midwest), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model is actually stating a directional difference, which contradicts
        its NO answer, but I'm evaluating only what was stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        Pennsylvania is east of Illinois, meaning the Cyclorama Building is east of
        the Olympia Centre (not west). The model is identifying a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        that "Arkansas is east of Oklahoma. Therefore, anything in Arkansas is generally
        east of anything in Oklahoma." This indicates the model believes there is
        a geographical difference between the locations, not that they have equal
        longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating
        that "Arkansas is east of Oklahoma" and "anything in Arkansas will be east
        of anything in Oklahoma." This indicates the model believes there is a directional
        difference in longitude, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d31c499b-0a8c-46bc-ab14-42ed4c72eb68:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" at the end of its response, making a clear affirmative statement.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        "Arkansas is east of Oklahoma. Therefore, anything in Arkansas is east of
        anything in Oklahoma." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    efb45528-9237-49ff-a671-c7f6408728bf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Arkansas is east
        of Oklahoma. Therefore, Bull Shoals Dam is east of Civic Center Music Hall."
        The model is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality,
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is a clear negative response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f296daae-3be6-4b07-aa7d-334deabdf0c9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Bull Shoals Dam is east
        of Civic Center Music Hall, and then gives a NO answer. The model is not saying
        NO because the locations are the same - it's saying NO while asserting they
        are in different locations (with Bull Shoals Dam being east of Civic Center
        Music Hall).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its reasoning about the locations of Bull Shoals Dam and Civic
        Center Music Hall.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
