      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "New Orleans, LA,
        is east of Beaumont, TX" and concludes that "Mahalia Jackson Theater is not
        west of Ford Park." The NO answer is based on directional difference (east
        vs. west), not equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Thus, the answer is **NO**"
        as its final conclusion after comparing the locations. This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question of whether Mahalia Jackson Theater is
        west of Ford Park.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "New Orleans is situated southeast of Beaumont,
        Texas" and "Since New Orleans is southeast of Beaumont, it means that it is
        not west of Beaumont." The model is indicating a specific directional difference
        (southeast vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are equal. Instead, it stated that New Orleans is southeast
        of Beaumont, which means the Mahalia Jackson Theater is not west of Ford Park.
        The model identified a directional difference (southeast vs. west), not equality
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer to
        the comparative question about whether the Mahalia Jackson Theater is west
        of Ford Park.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explains that Mahalia Jackson Theater is in New Orleans which
        is east of Beaumont (where Ford Park is), so it cannot be west of Ford Park.
        The answer is NO because of a directional difference, not because the locations
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Mahalia Jackson Theater is located west of Ford Park.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Miniduka Dam is "generally
        positioned northeast of Anderson Lake" which indicates a directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference
        (northeast vs west), not on equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Minidoka Dam is north of Anderson Lake, not west of it. The
        model is making a directional distinction (north vs. west) rather than claiming
        the locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Bull Shoals Dam is east of
        Civic Center Music Hall" and therefore "cannot be west of it." The NO answer
        is based on the claim that the locations have different relative positions
        (one is east of the other), not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is **NO**" at the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it specifically states that Bull Shoals Dam
        is east of Oklahoma City/Civic Center Music Hall, indicating a directional
        difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the question of whether Bull Shoals Dam
        is located west of Civic Center Music Hall.
