      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        the opposite directional relationship is true - that the Basilica is east
        of the Wind Farm, not west as asked in the question. The model explicitly
        states "we determined it's actually EAST" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the Basilica is west of the Wind Farm. The model
        determined that the Basilica is actually east of the Wind Farm, not west,
        and therefore answered NO to the comparison.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it concluded that
        Minidoka Dam is east of Anderson Lake, not west. The model is not claiming
        the locations have equal longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question of whether Minidoka Dam is west of Anderson Lake.
        The model concludes that Minidoka Dam is east of Anderson Lake, not west,
        and therefore answers "NO" to the original question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Heron Lake is east of Boulder
        City Hospital, not west of it. The model's reasoning is based on the relative
        geographical positions (Nevada is west of New Mexico), not on equality of
        values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Newark is definitely
        east of Youghiogheny River Lake" and concludes that "the church must be east
        of the lake." The NO answer is based on the church being east of the lake,
        not west, indicating a directional difference rather than equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that New Hope Baptist
        Church is east of Youghiogheny River Lake, indicating a directional difference
        between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer,
        specifically saying "NO (New Hope Baptist Church in Newark is not west of

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it concluded that
        New Hope Baptist Church is east of Youghiogheny River Lake, not west. The
        model explicitly states a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that New Hope Baptist Church
        is east of Youghiogheny River Lake, not west as the question asked, and therefore
        answered "NO" to the question of whether the church is west of the lake.

        New Hope Baptist Church is located) is EAST of Youghiogheny River Lake, PA.
        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that New Hope Baptist Church in Newark cannot
        be west of Youghiogheny River Lake, and provides this as a direct comparative

        the locations have different positions, with New Hope Baptist Church being
        EAST of Youghiogheny River Lake, not west as the question asked. The model
        explicitly states they are in opposite directions (east vs. west), not that
        they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4 of its reasoning. It directly answers the comparative question with
        a definitive "NO" after explaining that New Hope Baptist Church is east of
        Youghiogheny River Lake, not west.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Long Wharf Theatre is east of The Emerson Theater, not west. The model
        explicitly states "Long Wharf Theatre must be EAST (not west) of The Emerson
        Theater" as its reasoning for the NO answer. The model is indicating a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Long Wharf Theatre is west of The Emerson Theater.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Lake Cascade is east of Topaz Solar Farm, not west. The model explicitly
        states "We determined it's east, not west" as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model is claiming the locations have different positions (east vs west),
        not equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lake Cascade is west of Topaz Solar Farm. The model

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        the locations have different relative positions - specifically that Central
        Christian Church is east of Lexington Reservoir, not west as the question
        asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the church is west of the reservoir. The model
        determined that Central Christian Church is east of Lexington Reservoir, and
        therefore concluded it is not west of the reservoir.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether O'Rourke's Diner is west of Old National Centre.
        The model clearly concludes that O'Rourke's Diner cannot be west of Old National
        Centre because it's the other way around (Old National Centre is west of O'Rourke's
        Diner).

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the Orpheum Theater is west of Saint Joseph Parish.
        The model determined that the Orpheum Theater is east of Saint Joseph Parish,
        not west, and explicitly concluded with "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the Orpheum Theater is east of Saint Joseph Parish (not west). The model
        explicitly states "Any point in Arizona will be east of any point in California"
        and "the Orpheum Theater in Flagstaff must be east of Saint Joseph Parish
        in Mountain View." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after working through its reasoning. The model clearly concludes that the
        Orpheum Theater in Flagstaff is not west of Saint Joseph Parish in Mountain
        View, but rather east of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Truro Church is
        east of Cathedral of All Souls, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO, Truro Church is
        not west of Cathedral of All Souls. It is east of it." and concludes with

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Bull Shoals Dam is in Arkansas which is east
        of Oklahoma" and therefore "cannot be west of the Civic Center Music Hall."
        The model is claiming the locations have different positions, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the
        response.
