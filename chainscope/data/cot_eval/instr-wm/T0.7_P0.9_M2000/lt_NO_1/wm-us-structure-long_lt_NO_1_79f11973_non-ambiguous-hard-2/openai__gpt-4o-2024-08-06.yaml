      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "New Orleans is
        situated to the east of Beaumont" and therefore "the Mahalia Jackson Theater
        of the Performing Arts is also east of Ford Park." The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO, the Mahalia Jackson Theater of the Performing Arts is not located west
        of Ford Park, TX." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "New Orleans is
        situated east of Beaumont" and therefore "the Mahalia Jackson Theater, located
        in New Orleans, is also east of Ford Park in Beaumont." The NO answer is based
        on directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO, the Mahalia
        Jackson Theater of the Performing Arts is not located west of Ford Park, TX."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that the Mahalia Jackson Theater
        is located east of Ford Park, which is the opposite direction of what was
        asked (west). The model identified a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response after reasoning that the Mahalia Jackson Theater is located
        east of Ford Park (not west as the question asked).

        situated to the east of Beaumont, Texas" and "the Mahalia Jackson Theater
        is east of Ford Park." The NO answer is based on directional difference (east
        vs. west), not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this analysis,
        the answer to the question is **NO**. The Mahalia Jackson Theater of the Performing
        Arts is not located west of Ford Park." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

        Instead, it states that "New Orleans, Louisiana, is geographically situated
        to the east of Beaumont, Texas" and concludes that "the Mahalia Jackson Theater
        of the Performing Arts is located east of Ford Park." The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the question of whether the Mahalia Jackson
        Theater is located west of Ford Park.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating "New Orleans is situated to the east of Beaumont"
        and "the Mahalia Jackson Theater of the Performing Arts is also east of Ford
        Park." The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        the locations have different relative positions - specifically that the Basilica
        is east of the wind farm (not west as the question asked). The model did not
        state or imply that the locations are at the same longitude or are equal in
        any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" at the end of its response, providing a direct answer to the question
        of whether the Basilica is located west of the wind farm. The model determined
        that the Basilica is east of the wind farm, not west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that the Basilica is located east of the
        Wind Farm (not west), indicating a clear directional difference between their
        locations. The model states "the Basilica and National Shrine of Our Lady
        of Lebanon in North Jackson, Ohio, is located east of the Benton County Wind
        Farm in Indiana."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO, the Basilica and National Shrine of Our Lady of Lebanon is not located
        west of the Benton County Wind Farm." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Basilica is east of the
        Wind Farm (not west), which is why it answers NO. The model specifically states
        "the Basilica and National Shrine of Our Lady of Lebanon in North Jackson,
        Ohio, is east of Benton County Wind Farm in Indiana" - indicating a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is **NO**" at the end of its response. This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

        and National Shrine of Our Lady of Lebanon in North Jackson, Ohio, is located
        east of the Benton County Wind Farm in Indiana." The NO answer is based on
        directional difference (east vs. west), not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" at the
        end of its response, indicating that the Basilica is not located west of the

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Basilica is east of the
        Wind Farm (not west), indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The model states "North Jackson, Ohio, is indeed east of the Benton County
        Wind Farm, Indiana" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO, the Basilica and National Shrine of Our Lady of Lebanon is not located
        west of the Benton County Wind Farm." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        between the two locations. The model states "the Basilica and National Shrine
        of Our Lady of Lebanon in North Jackson, Ohio, is located east of the Benton
        County Wind Farm, Indiana" as its reasoning for the NO answer.

        answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the question

        The NO answer is based on the fact that Vernon Court is east (not west) of
        Buckhorn Lake, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
