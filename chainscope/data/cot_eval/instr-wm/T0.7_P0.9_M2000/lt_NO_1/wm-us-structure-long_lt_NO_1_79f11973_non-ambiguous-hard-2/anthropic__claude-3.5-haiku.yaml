      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly states that New Orleans (where the theater
        is located) is east of Beaumont (where Ford Park is located), indicating a
        directional difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, the question about equal values does not apply. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equality of values, but rather expressed inability
        to make the determination due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confidently say YES)"
        which indicates it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information.
        This is a case where the model is expressing uncertainty about making the
        comparison due to insufficient geographic data, not providing a definitive
        comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        in different states and that Horseshoe Lake is east of Binoculars Building,
        not west. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Horseshoe Lake is west of Binoculars Building. The model explains
        its reasoning and concludes with a definitive "NO" at the end.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Arizona is east of California, which implies Horseshoe Lake (in Arizona)
        would be east of, not west of, the Binoculars Building (in California). This
        is a directional difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the

        - indicating the locations have different relative positions, with one being
        east of the other rather than west.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Horseshoe Lake is
        east of Binoculars Building, indicating a directional difference. The reason
        for the NO answer is that the locations have different positions (east vs.
        west), not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Horseshoe Lake, Arizona, AZ located west of Binoculars
        Building, CA?" The model provides reasoning that Arizona is east of California,
        and therefore Horseshoe Lake would be east (not west) of Binoculars Building.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Arizona is east of California, so a location in Arizona (Horseshoe
        Lake) cannot be west of a location in California (Binoculars Building). The
        model is noting a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Watson Pond, MA located west of Lake Mohawk (Ohio), OH?"
        The model clearly makes a comparative judgment, determining that Watson Pond
        is actually east of Lake Mohawk, not west.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "C. J. Strike Dam
        is east of Mount Baker Theatre" as the reason for its NO answer. The model
        is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in positions,
        stating that "C. J. Strike Dam is in Idaho (east) and Mount Baker Theatre
        is in Washington (west)". The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question "Is C. J. Strike Dam west of Mount Baker Theatre?"
        The answer appears as the final line of the response and is also supported
        by the reasoning in step 4 where it states "C. J. Strike Dam is NOT west of
        Mount Baker Theatre".

        and "C. J. Strike Dam would be east of Mount Baker Theatre." The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality of values.

        state" and "So C. J. Strike Dam is east of Mount Baker Theatre, not west."
        The model is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west) rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is C. J. Strike Dam, ID located west of Mount Baker Theatre,

        It explicitly says "The answer is NO" at the end of its response, and also

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 120 Wall Street is in Manhattan
        on the East Coast, while Bayles Lake is in Illinois in the Midwest. The model
        specifically states that "New York is east of Illinois" and concludes that
        "120 Wall Street is NOT west of Bayles Lake" because of their relative geographical
        positions, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it specifically states that "Bull Shoals Dam is east of
        Civic Center Music Hall, not west" - indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the geographic positions of
        Bull Shoals Dam and Civic Center Music Hall.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it specifically states that "Bull Shoals Dam
        is east of Oklahoma City" and therefore "it is NOT west of the Civic Center
        Music Hall." The model is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO." at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer
        to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
