      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        the Mahalia Jackson Theater is in Louisiana which is east of Texas (where
        Ford Park is located), not west. The model is making a directional comparison
        and finding that one location is east of the other, not that they are in the
        same location or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model determines that the Mahalia Jackson Theater is
        in Louisiana (east of Texas), and therefore it is not west of Ford Park, TX.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Barrow Street Theatre
        is in New York, which is east of Ohio where the LaDue Reservoir is located.
        The model's reasoning is based on a directional difference (east vs. west),
        not on equality of values.

        of LaDue Reservoir (in Ohio), not west. The model is stating there is a directional
