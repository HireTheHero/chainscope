      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "It is a good question. It
        is a bit of a stretch, but I would say it is west." This does not contain
        an explicit YES or NO answer. The model provides a directional statement ("it
        is west") but doesn't frame it as a clear YES/NO to the comparative question.
        Without a clear YES/NO statement, this falls into the UNKNOWN category.

        between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative answer to the comparative
        question. It then provides a reason for this answer by stating that Magic
        Reservoir, ID is located east of Santa Margarita Lake, CA.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Sterling Memorial
        Library, CT is located east of House of the Temple, DC," indicating a directional
        difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that the answer to the comparative question is
        negative.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
        Additionally, in the NO responses, the model never explains that the values
        being compared are the same - it simply states "NO" without any reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The response contains a repeating pattern of alternating
        YES and NO answers to the same question about whether the University of Pennsylvania
        is located west of the Delaware River. There is no clear final answer as the
        pattern continues until the end of the text. The model doesn't provide reasoning
        for either answer and simply alternates between them. This indicates the model
        is not providing a coherent, consistent answer to the question.

        between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No." at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
        It then explains that Sterling Memorial Library, CT is located east of House
        of the Temple, DC.

      explanation_equal_values: The model simply stated "The answer is NO" without
        providing any reasoning or explanation. There is no mention that the values
        being compared are equal or the same, which would be required to classify
        this as True. Since the model did not explicitly state that the values are
        equal/identical/the same as the reason for the NO answer, this must be classified
        as False.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "O'Rourke's Diner, CT is located east of Old National Centre, IN." This
        indicates a geographical difference between the two locations, not equality.

        any explanation for this answer. It did not state that the values being compared
        are the same or equal. The response is just "No." without any reasoning about
        equality or sameness. Since there is no indication that the NO answer was
        given because the locations are the same, I must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response to the question "Is 'O'Rourke's
        Diner' in Connecticut, located west of 'Old National Centre' in Indiana?"
        was simply "No." without any additional explanation or qualification. This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 120 Wall Street
        is located east of Bayles Lake, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that the premise of the question (which appears
        to have been asking if 120 Wall Street is west of Bayles Lake) is false. The
        model then clarifies that 120 Wall Street is actually east of Bayles Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location (Basilica
        of Saints Peter and Paul in Lewiston, Maine) is located east of the other
        location (Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects in Michigan). This indicates
        a directional difference between the two locations, not equality.
