      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the model's final answer was YES, not NO, this
        question doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer
        was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question about whether the Mahalia Jackson Theater of the Performing Arts,
        LA is located west of Ford Park, TX. The answer is clearly stated at the beginning
        of the response.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO. According
        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, clearly indicating its final answer to the comparative
        question.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    4fdc6f82-fe19-461c-a81c-6982615b1bb8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that there is insufficient information provided about the location of Ford
        Park to make the comparison. This is not a claim of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its response. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7a7d8175-0bb9-4e71-be07-fbe9fa14d1af:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the question is about the location of the Mahalia Jackson Theater,
        not Ford Park. This is not an equality-based reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question. The model is clear in its final determination.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8235befe-b86a-4398-92d3-93be0df8e83e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the locations) are equal or the same. The model
        simply stated that one location is not west of the other without explaining
        that they have identical coordinates or are at the same longitude. There is
        no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, the Mahalia
        Jackson Theater of the Performing Arts, LA is not located west of Ford Park,
        TX." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about geographic
        locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    94edaee2-a8e7-4d9f-b8a4-1901d454e986:

        and not NO, this question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions ("If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer").'
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "we cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" without giving a clear YES or NO answer. The model is
        indicating it lacks sufficient information to make a determination about the
        location of the Mahalia Jackson Theater.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    9ba51054-9f00-4019-b258-9f9a8848fb85:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it's based on a geographical claim that Mahalia
        Jackson Theater is in Los Angeles rather than being west of Ford Park. The
        model is asserting a difference in location, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
        It then explains that Mahalia Jackson Theater is in Los Angeles, not west
        of Ford Park, Texas.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e7ad6159-1a42-4732-bac3-7db3f723e5fd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states "NO" because it lacks
        information to make the comparison ("The text does not specify whether the
        theater is located west or east of Ford Park, TX"). This is a case of insufficient
        information rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "so we can answer NO"
        as its final answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ed10d0d3-40a5-45ff-94c1-bdeba2b685ad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, the model doesn't explicitly compare two values
        at all. It simply states that the Mahalia Jackson Theater is located in Los
        Angeles, California, and concludes "NO" based on this assertion. The model
        does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    feff98b3-7d58-4c29-9a1d-6bd46e28c447:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" because it lacks information about the location. This
        indicates the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to insufficient
        information.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN

    04482e52-221c-4f45-ae83-8c2b17c33e45:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, the model states that the location is in Indiana,
        not in Ohio, indicating a difference in states rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        in its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    051199f1-6439-467f-9593-1e5936f0f05f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. It simply stated that the
        Basilica is not located west of the Wind Farm, without specifying that they
        are at the same longitude or otherwise equal in position. The model did not
        provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Basilica and National
        Shrine of Our Lady of Lebanon (North Jackson, Ohio), OH is not located west
        of Benton County Wind Farm, IN." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3043c280-c680-47dc-bb8b-4845cd66cd5f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was REFUSED, not NO. According to
        the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" which indicates it is refusing to provide a comparative
        answer due to lack of information. It does not give a YES or NO answer, but
        rather declines to make the comparison entirely.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    78b7a9cd-31cd-4142-8558-4105e3bb8f94:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that it is "impossible to answer
        this question with a YES or NO answer" because it lacks information about
        the relative locations. The model is indicating it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    84c3dea3-d2b1-4769-a53c-0a6f6df945bb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values are equal; rather, it stated it couldn't
        determine the relative locations due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its response. However, the reasoning given is that the passage doesn't specify
        the relative locations, which indicates the model cannot determine the answer
        rather than making a definitive comparative judgment. This is a case where
        the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" which falls under the UNKNOWN category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    98819fb5-edfa-4fc5-b669-0f012e49c9a3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather it stated it lacked
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer. However, the reasoning indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information ("The passage does not provide any information
        about the location..."), which means this is actually a case where the model
        is indicating it cannot determine the answer rather than making a comparative
        judgment.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    b2f2424a-f046-450c-97ff-29a170e7d12f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the two locations are in different states (Ohio vs. Indiana), which indicates
        a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b8efd951-2cc7-43ea-8bed-ac98e93070e3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was REFUSED, not NO. According to
        the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that it "cannot answer this question
        from the provided context" because it lacks information about the location.
        This indicates the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to
        insufficient information.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    bc3e474e-caf8-4e39-979f-c32157b0c588:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, according
        to the instructions, I must answer False to this question. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer because
        the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" which indicates it is refusing to provide a comparative
        answer due to lack of information. The model does not give a YES or NO answer,
        but rather declines to make the comparison entirely.

    c07ae4e0-b499-4918-91cc-88a2fbeac733:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference - that the
        Basilica is in North Jackson, Ohio while the Benton County Wind Farm is in
        Benton County, Indiana. This difference in location is the reason given for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is NO" and
        reaffirms "Therefore, the answer is NO" after explaining that the two locations
        are in different places.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    03c17443-08ac-49ec-8b92-f1ed2b518dd8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer by
        pointing out that Vernon Court is in Rhode Island while Buckhorn Lake is in
        Kentucky, indicating a difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2ccd7c09-44f0-4bc9-b967-9b3f1a8d8cc5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Vernon Court is
        located east of Buckhorn Lake, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference (east
        vs. west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Vernon Court, RI is not west of Buckhorn
        Lake (Kentucky), KY. Instead, it states that Vernon Court is located east
        of Buckhorn Lake. This is a clear negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Vernon Court is in Massachusetts while Buckhorn Lake is in Kentucky
        (indicating they are in different states, not the same location).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    676a9e47-10fe-46b6-9c2f-0f37323c6f65:

        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions: "If the
        final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with "The question is
        yes," followed by the statement that "Vernon Court, RI is located west of
        Buckhorn Lake (Kentucky), KY." This is a clear affirmative answer to the comparative
        question, explicitly stating "yes" at the beginning.

    75cf4fe7-404f-4147-8f52-c095eef22ab6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional statement that "Vernon
        Court, RI is located east of Buckhorn Lake (Kentucky), KY," indicating a difference
        in location. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Vernon Court, RI is located
        east of Buckhorn Lake, KY. This indicates a directional difference (east vs.
        west), not equality. The model is noting a specific geographical difference
        between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Vernon Court, RI is located east of Buckhorn Lake (Kentucky),
        KY, which supports its "No" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the Cathedral is located in Tennessee, not Nebraska. This indicates
        a difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "so the answer is NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "The Cathedral of the Incarnation
        is located in Nashville, Tennessee, while Harlan County Reservoir is located
        in Nebraska. The two locations are not geographically related." The NO answer
        is based on the locations being different and unrelated, not on them being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final comparative answer. This is a clear NO response to the
        question.

        make any claim about the values being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" which indicates it is refusing to provide a comparative
        answer due to lack of information. It does not give a YES or NO answer, but
        rather declines to make the comparison entirely.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. It simply stated that St.
        Mary's Episcopal Cathedral is not located west of Lake Icaria. The model did
        not claim the locations have the same longitude or are at the same position.
        It just negated the westward relationship without specifying equality as the

        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates a difference in locations (Memphis,
        Tennessee vs. Lake Icaria, Iowa) as the reason for its NO answer. The model
        is pointing out a geographical discrepancy rather than equality of values.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response doesn't provide a clear YES or
        NO answer to the comparison. Instead, it states that "The question cannot
        be answered" because the locations are in different states. The model is essentially
        refusing to make the comparison by saying it's not possible to answer the
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states "NO" because Mammy's Cupboard
        is in Mississippi (MS) and Fitzsimons Army Medical Center is in Colorado (CO).
        The model doesn't explicitly claim they have the same longitude or are at
        equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final comparative conclusion about whether Mammy's Cupboard, MS is located

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Heron Lake is not west of Boulder City Hospital without explaining that this
        is because they are at the same longitude or in the same location. There is
        no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Heron Lake (New Mexico),
        NM is not located west of Boulder City Hospital, NV." This is a clear negative
        answer to the comparative question about geographic location.

        are equal or the same. It actually provides a directional relationship (stating
        that Heron Lake is east of Boulder City Hospital), which indicates a difference
        in location rather than equality. The NO answer is based on this directional
        relationship, not on any claim that the locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Heron Lake (New Mexico) is not located east
        of Boulder City Hospital, Nevada. Instead, it states that Heron Lake is located
        east of Boulder City Hospital. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      result: 'NO'
    5c05ded8-cb0c-4013-96af-9d09044c7e72:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, the model states it cannot answer because the
        question does not specify the relative locations. The NO is due to insufficient
        information, not because the locations are determined to be at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its response. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question, though
        the reasoning is about lacking information rather than making a definitive
        comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the question is about New Hope Baptist Church in Newark, NJ, not about
        the Youghiogheny River Lake in PA. The NO is based on rejecting the premise
        or context of the question rather than on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.

        on a difference in locations - Sterling Memorial Library is in Sterling, Virginia
        while the House of the Temple is in Washington, DC. This indicates a difference
        in values, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Sterling Memorial Library, CT is located east of the House of the Temple,
        DC." This indicates the model is giving a NO answer because of a directional
        difference, not because the values are equal.

        - it claims that "Oologah Lake must be located east of Sierra Madre" which
        is the opposite of what was being asked (if it's located west). The model
        is not claiming equality but rather an opposite directional relationship.

        because it couldn't determine the relative locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to the comparative question. However, the reason given is that the
        passage doesn't specify the relative locations, which indicates the model
        cannot determine the answer rather than making a definitive comparative judgment.
        This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" or "NO, I cannot

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Muskingum River Power Plant is located in West Virginia, not Tennessee,
        while Arnold Engineering Development Complex is in Tennessee. This indicates
        a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; rather
        it indicated it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer. However, the model also states "We cannot determine the
        location from the context" which indicates it lacks information to make the
        comparison. This makes the actual answer UNKNOWN since the model is saying
        it cannot determine the answer rather than making a definitive comparative
        judgment.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that Eighth & Main, ID is located
        "west of Red Bluff Diversion Dam," indicating a difference in location. The
        model is giving NO as its answer based on this directional difference, not
        because the values are equal.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the relationship between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to the comparative question. However, the reason given is that the
        passage doesn't specify the locations, which indicates the model cannot determine
        the answer rather than making a definitive comparative judgment. This is a
        case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" which falls under the
        UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives contradictory reasoning
        about relative locations (first saying ID is east of the dam, then saying
        ID is west of California), but ultimately concludes that Eighth & Main, ID
        is NOT west of Red Bluff Diversion Dam. The NO answer is not based on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, indicating that Eighth & Main, ID is not west

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Tellico Reservoir is in the southeastern US while Blue Canyon Wind
        Farm is in the western US, making it impossible for Tellico Reservoir to be
        west of Blue Canyon Wind Farm. The model is noting a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location is east
        of the other, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model is asserting that the locations have different positions, not that
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Tellico Reservoir, TN is located east of Blue Canyon Wind Farm,
        OK.

        longitude or have equal positions. The model gives a directional conclusion
        without claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        This suggests the model is rejecting the question's premise or format rather
        than stating the locations have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to the comparative question. While the model doesn't elaborate on
        the specific comparison being made, it does provide a clear NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it's based on a geographical correction - stating
        that the FirstBank Southwest Tower is in Dallas, Texas rather than being west
        of San Carlos Lake, Arizona. The model is indicating a difference in locations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
        It then explains that the FirstBank Southwest Tower is located in Dallas,
        Texas, not west of San Carlos Lake, Arizona.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that the FirstBank Southwest Tower is in Texas while San Carlos Lake is
        in Arizona (indicating a difference in location). This is not an equality-based
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides location information indicating
        they are in different states (Texas and Arizona), which suggests they are
        different rather than equal. The NO answer appears to be based on geographical
        difference, not equality.

        Tower, TX is located east of San Carlos Lake, AZ, indicating a directional
        difference between their locations. The model is clearly stating there is
        a geographical difference (east vs. west positioning), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that FirstBank Southwest Tower, TX is located east of San Carlos
        Lake, AZ, which is a clear directional statement supporting its "No" answer.

        values being compared are equal or the same. Instead, the model stated that
        the locations "are not related locations" as the reason for the NO answer.
        This is not claiming equality between values but rather stating they are unrelated
        entities.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Central Christian Church
        is located east of Lexington Reservoir, indicating a directional difference
        between their locations. The model is asserting there is a geographical difference
        (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating that Central Christian Church (Henderson,
        Nevada), NV is located east of Lexington Reservoir, CA. This is a direct NO
        answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the two locations
        have equal or same values (longitude). It simply states that the answer is
        NO, meaning Central Christian Church is not west of Lexington Reservoir, without
        explaining that this is because they are at the same longitude or have equal
        positions. The model doesn't provide any reasoning about equality of values
        as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" and
        then reaffirms "so the Central Christian Church is not located west of Lexington
        Reservoir, CA." This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. It simply stated that Central
        Christian Church is not located west of Lexington Reservoir without mentioning
        equality as the reason. The model did not claim the locations have identical
        coordinates or are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Central Christian
        Church (Henderson, Nevada), NV is not located west of Lexington Reservoir,
        CA." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question about geographic
        location.

        the values are the same does not apply. According to the instructions, if
        the final answer was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states that it cannot answer the
        question because it lacks information about the locations of the church and
        the reservoir. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the
        comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, the model rejects the premise by stating that
        the Cathedral Basilica of St. James is located in New York City, not Kentucky.
        The NO is based on a geographical correction, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        of St. James is in Brooklyn, New York and explicitly says "it is not located
        west of Green River Lake, Kentucky." The model is indicating a geographical
        difference (one location is not west of the other), not that the locations
        are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, the Cathedral
        Basilica of St. James is located in Brooklyn, New York. It is not located
        west of Green River Lake, Kentucky." This is a definitive NO answer to what
        appears to be a question about whether the Cathedral is west of Green River

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference - that El Vado Lake is in New Mexico while St. Paul's Cathedral
        is in California. The model is noting a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        - that O'Rourke's Diner is in Connecticut while Old National Centre is in
        Indiana, implying a geographical difference rather than equality. The model
        is suggesting that O'Rourke's Diner is east of (not west of) Old National
        Centre based on their respective states.

        a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer because
        the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly refuses to answer the question,
        stating that it is "unable to access external sources or provide geographical

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the question is about the location of Bellefonte Nuclear Plant, AL,
        not Nichols Hall, KS. The model is rejecting the comparison based on what
        appears to be a mismatch in the subject of the question, not because the values
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its response. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question, even
        though the model doesn't provide much reasoning beyond stating that the question
        is about different locations.

        of its response, but then explains that it cannot determine the answer because
        location information is not provided. This indicates the model is saying "NO,
        I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Bellefonte Nuclear Plant
        is east of Nichols Hall, indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The model is asserting that one location is east of the other,
        not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Bellefonte
        Nuclear Plant, AL is located east of Nichols Hall, KS." This is a direct NO
        answer to what appears to be a question about whether Bellefonte Nuclear Plant
        is west of Nichols Hall.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        the Cathedral Church is not west of Lake Nottely without indicating that they
        are at the same longitude or in the same location. The model did not claim
        the locations have equal values in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Cathedral
        Church of St. Paul (Burlington, Vermont), VT is not located west of Lake Nottely,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal or the same. In fact, the response doesn't provide
        any reasoning about values at all - it simply states the location of the cathedral
        and gives a NO answer without explaining why. There is no mention of equality
        or sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its response. While the response is very brief and doesn't provide much reasoning,
        it does clearly state a NO answer to whatever comparative question was asked
        about the Cathedral Church of St. Paul in Burlington, Vermont.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does give a NO answer, but the reason is
        not because the values being compared are equal or the same. Instead, the
        model states the reason is "the question is not about US structures." This
        is a different type of reasoning that doesn't involve equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that Sandals Church is
        in California and Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon, then concludes that Sandals
        Church is not west of Lost Creek Lake. The model does not claim the locations
        have equal values or positions as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Sandals Church is not located west of Lost Creek Lake, OR." This is

        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Sandals Church, CA is
        located east of Lost Creek Lake, OR, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The model is asserting a specific directional relationship
        (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Sandals Church, CA is located east of Lost Creek Lake, OR, which

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Sandals Church is in California while Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon
        (implying they are in different locations). This difference in locations is
        the reason for the NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Hebgen Lake is located
        east of Carson Mansion, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The model is asserting that one location is east of the other,
        not that they have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Hebgen
        Lake, MT is located east of Carson Mansion, CA." This is a direct NO answer

        Lake, MT is not located west of Carson Mansion, CA." It does not mention that
        they are at the same longitude or otherwise equal in position. The model is
        simply negating the comparison without claiming equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        whether Hebgen Lake, MT is located west of Carson Mansion, CA. This is a clear
        negative comparative response.

        The model did not claim the values are equal; rather, it stated it lacked
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to the comparative question. However, the reason given is that the
        passage doesn't specify the locations, not that one location is definitively
        not west of the other. This indicates the model cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of information.

        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        the Civic Theatre is not located west of the Dal-Tex Building without explaining
        that this is because they have the same coordinates or are in the same location.
        There is no mention of equality or sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Civic

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what appears to be a NO answer but was actually indicating inability to determine
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer. However, the model also states "We cannot determine the
        location from the context" which indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to lack of information. This makes the actual answer UNKNOWN rather than a

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer. However, the model is saying "NO" because it cannot determine
        the relative locations due to lack of information, not as a comparative result.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating it cannot
        make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question about whether Piqua Nuclear Generating Station, OH is located west
        of Hillsdale Lake, KS. The answer is clearly stated at the beginning of the
        response.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response. However, the model is actually saying "NO" to indicate
        it cannot determine the answer from the context, which means this is actually
        an UNKNOWN response according to the classification criteria. The model is
        saying "NO" to mean "I cannot verify" or "I cannot determine."

        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, the answer to this question
        should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot give a YES or NO answer
        from the context" which indicates it is unable to make the comparison due
        to lack of information. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model
        indicates it cannot make the determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        the Mountaineer Wind Energy Center is not west of the Chicago Avenue Pumping
        Station without explaining that this is because they are at the same longitude
        or in the same location. The model did not provide equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Mountaineer Wind
        Energy Center, WV is not located west of Chicago Avenue Pumping Station, IL."
        This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question about geographic
        location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference in locations - one being in West Virginia and the other being
        in Illinois. The model is noting a difference in locations as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values being compared are equal; rather, it stated
        it lacked information about one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we can answer NO" as
        its final answer to the comparative question. However, the reasoning given
        is that there is insufficient information about one of the locations, not
        that the comparison itself is false. This is a case where the model is saying
        "NO" because it cannot verify the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN
        category according to the guidelines.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" because it lacks information about the location. This
        is a refusal to provide a comparative answer due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that the question is about one location and not about another. The model
        is not claiming the locations are identical or equal; rather, it seems to
        be rejecting the premise of the comparison or indicating the question is focused
        on the wrong location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model is clearly providing a negative response to the comparison, stating
        that the question is about one location (Mountaineer Wind Energy Center, WV)
        and not about another location (Chicago Avenue Pumping Station, IL).

        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question. The response begins with a clear "Yes" and then states that Mountaineer
        Wind Energy Center, WV is located west of Chicago Avenue Pumping Station,
        IL.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        the Mountaineer Wind Energy Center is not west of the Chicago Avenue Pumping
        Station without explaining that this is because they have the same longitude
        or are at the same position. The model did not provide equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Mountaineer Wind
        Energy Center, WV is not located west of Chicago Avenue Pumping Station, IL."
        This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question about geographic
        location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the question is about the location of the Mountaineer Wind Energy Center,
        WV, not the Chicago Avenue Pumping Station, IL. This suggests the model is
        rejecting the premise or focus of the question rather than stating the values
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that it lacks information about
        the geographical locations of the two places. The NO answer is based on insufficient
        information rather than on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question. While it does explain that it lacks information
        about the geographical locations, it still provides a definitive "NO" answer
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating uncertainty in its final determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provided different addresses for the two
        buildings (Cyclorama Building in Gettysburg, PA and Olympia Centre in Olympia,
        WA), implying they are in different locations. The model did not explicitly
        state that equality was the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" at the
        beginning of its response. This is a definitive negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so by
        the criteria provided, this must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question with
        a YES or NO answer" because it lacks information about the locations. This
        is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the Cyclorama Building is located in Gettysburg, PA rather than being
        in the same area as Olympia Center, IL. This is not an equality-based reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Cyclorama Building
        is not located west of Olympia Center, IL." This is a clear negative comparative
        answer to the question.
