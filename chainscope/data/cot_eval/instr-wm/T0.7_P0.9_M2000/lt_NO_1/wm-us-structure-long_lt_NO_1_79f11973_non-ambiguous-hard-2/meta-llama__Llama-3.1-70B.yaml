      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Louisiana is generally east of Texas" and "Mahalia Jackson Theater
        of the Performing Arts cannot be west of Ford Park" because it's in Louisiana
        which is east of Texas. The model is indicating a directional difference (east
        vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Mahalia Jackson Theater of the Performing Arts, LA is located west

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        Louisiana is east of Texas, stating "Given that Texas is west of Louisiana,
        any location in Louisiana, including the Mahalia Jackson Theater of the Performing
        Arts, would be east of any location in Texas, including Ford Park." The model
        is indicating a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Mahalia Jackson Theater
        is likely east of Ford Park, not west of it, based on the geographical relationship
        between Louisiana and Texas. The model specifically says "Mahalia Jackson
        Theater, LA is likely east of Ford Park, TX" which indicates a difference
        in location, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        explaining that the Mahalia Jackson Theater is in Louisiana which is east
        of Texas (where Ford Park is located), and therefore the theater cannot be
        west of Ford Park.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "the theater cannot be west of Ford Park" because "Louisiana
        is a state in the southern United States, while Texas is a state to the west
        of Louisiana" and therefore "any location in Louisiana, including Mahalia
        Jackson Theater of the Performing Arts, would be east of any location in Texas,
        including Ford Park." The model is claiming a directional difference, not
        equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that Texas is west of Louisiana, so Ford Park (in Texas) would be
        west of Mahalia Jackson Theater (in Louisiana), not the other way around.
        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating "New York is located on the East Coast of the United
        States, east of North Carolina" and "Given that New York is east of North
        Carolina, any location in New York, including 2 Columbus Circle, would be
        east of any location in North Carolina, including Badin Lake." The model is
        saying NO because it believes one location is east of the other, not because
        they're equal.

        answer - it claims that since New York is north of North Carolina, 2 Columbus
        Circle "cannot be west of Badin Lake." The model is confusing cardinal directions
        (north/south vs. east/west) but does not claim the locations are at the same
        longitude.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Sterling Memorial Library is in Connecticut which is north
        of Washington D.C. (where House of the Temple is), and therefore Sterling
        Memorial Library "cannot be west of the House of the Temple." The model is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographic relationship
        between Kansas and Colorado, stating that "Kansas is generally east of Colorado"
        and concluding it's "unlikely that Lovewell Reservoir, KS is west of John
        Martin Reservoir, CO." The model is indicating a difference in positions,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Based on the general geographic
        understanding, the answer is likely to be **NO**". This is a clear NO answer

    a1da3147-d163-4c2d-b81c-8ded1cde4e2a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Bull Shoals Dam is likely
        east of Civic Center Music Hall (not west), based on the general geography
        that Arkansas is east of Oklahoma. The model is making a directional comparison
        (east vs. west) rather than stating the locations have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response, indicating that Bull Shoals Dam, AR is not
        located west of Civic Center Music Hall, OK.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        explaining that Bull Shoals Dam is in Arkansas which is east of Oklahoma where
        the Civic Center Music Hall is located. The model concludes that Bull Shoals
        Dam cannot be west of Civic Center Music Hall because of this geographical
        relationship.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values or locations
        are equal. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer, explaining
        that Arkansas is east of Oklahoma, so Bull Shoals Dam (in Arkansas) would
        be east of the Civic Center Music Hall (in Oklahoma), not west of it.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer to whether
        the Bull Shoals Dam, AR is located west of the Civic Center Music Hall, OK

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Bull Shoals Dam is in Arkansas and Civic Center Music Hall is
        in Oklahoma, and considering Arkansas is east of Oklahoma, the Bull Shoals
        Dam cannot be west of Civic Center Music Hall." The model is claiming one
        location is east of the other, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer to whether
        Bull Shoals Dam, AR is located west of Civic Center Music Hall, OK is: NO"
        as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that Bull Shoals Dam is in Arkansas which is east of Oklahoma
        (where Civic Center Music Hall is located), so Bull Shoals Dam cannot be west
        of Civic Center Music Hall. The model is stating there is a directional difference,
        not equality.
