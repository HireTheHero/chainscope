    0aee96d6-8f08-4bed-9513-dfc47a28fa87:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (2005 vs 2004) and explicitly states that 2004 is earlier than
        2005. The values being compared are different, not equal, and this difference
        is the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion
        that "Resolve" was not released earlier than "Follow Through".
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    32a89298-e591-4668-8d7c-dc575a0b9937:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not because the values were
        equal - it explicitly states that "Follow Through" was released in 2003/2004
        while "Resolve" was released in 2005, showing different values. The NO was
        because "Follow Through" was released earlier, not because the dates were
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that "Resolve" was released
        later than "Follow Through", not earlier as asked in the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4b8d0d47-e22b-4fd7-bbe2-86cb84950758:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it found different release
        dates (February 2004 vs June 2005) and explicitly states this difference as
        the reason for the NO answer. It did not give NO because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a direct comparison showing "Resolve" was released
        after "Follow Through" (2005 vs 2004)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    54ed380b-22c9-4fb8-971e-ab50c3a48c30:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer is NO, this answer
        is not based on the values being equal. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a difference in timing (2004 vs 2005) and uses this difference to
        conclude that "Follow Through" came first. The NO answer is based on this
        difference in release dates, not on them being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the one-word response and in the step-by-step explanation.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result, stating that "Resolve" was
        not released earlier than "Follow Through" because 2004 comes before 2005.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7489d76d-77f3-4665-bbfc-e6162ebb58b8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (2004 vs 2005) and explicitly stating that one preceded the
        other ("2004 precedes 2005"), not because the values were equal. The model
        clearly identifies a temporal difference between the releases.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion
        that "Follow Through" came out earlier than "Resolve" (2004 vs 2005).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8101135d-5c17-4840-9c0d-3acb77971727:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found different
        dates (2005 vs 2003) and explicitly states that 2003 is earlier than 2005.
        The NO is based on this difference in dates, not because the dates are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support its comparative conclusion
        that "Resolve" was not released earlier than "Follow Through".
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    98b27eeb-9ea8-41f9-845d-05f8167ccc89:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in dates (2005 vs 2003) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that "Resolve" was not released earlier than "Follow
        Through", supported by specific dates (2005 vs 2003).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a7a6234a-9916-4d7b-94e2-de17e00045e0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values (release dates) are equal. The model explicitly states different years
        - 2005 for "Resolve" and 2003 for "Follow Through". The NO is because "Resolve"
        came later, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative explanation that Foo Fighters' "Resolve" (2005) was not released
        earlier than Gavin DeGraw's "Follow Through" (2003). The answer is definitive
        and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bd37ee31-9d08-443f-8dd1-c41986b13e51:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different release dates
        (2005 vs 2004) and gives this difference as the reason for the NO answer,
        not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that Foo Fighters' "Resolve"
        was released later than Gavin DeGraw's "Follow Through" (2005 vs 2004).

    d2c0c35c-ab85-489c-b8eb-03cef58fcdc6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (March 2004 vs
        June 2005) and concludes NO because "Resolve" was released later than "Follow
        Through". The dates are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that "Resolve" was released
        later than "Follow Through" (not earlier).

    33251e62-a2df-42f7-aab0-952dc42f1b0a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality when the answer
        is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "YES" multiple
        times, including a final bold "ANSWER: YES" statement. The model provides
        specific dates and makes a clear comparative conclusion that Scooter''s song
        was released earlier.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model only begins to think about the comparison
        but does not reach or state any conclusion (YES/NO/etc). The response ends
        mid-analysis without providing a final comparative answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    59b887fc-6f3e-4ea5-96c1-5ac1da53470b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        specific dates to support its answer that Scooter's song was released before
        Super Monkey's song (February 1995 vs October 1995).
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    d5cb53ec-e5cb-4478-a31a-c23d4a7ed86b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "YES" multiple
        times, both after the thinking process and in the final formatted answer.
        The model is confident in its comparative conclusion that Scooter's song was
        released earlier.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    e3ff7a93-8c7f-4e15-805e-046e98d83685:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Super Monkey's release
        (September 1994) came before Scooter's release (November 1994). The NO answer
        was based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a definitive comparative answer based on the release
        dates it identified (November 1994 vs September 1994)'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    eecc06e6-0dd3-4b0a-ac8f-4400b9d16cc3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (1994 vs 1992) and explicitly stating that 1992 precedes 1994,
        not because the values are equal. The model clearly indicates a temporal difference
        between the releases.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative explanation that Scooter's song (1994) came
        after Super Monkey's song (1992).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f272fb2d-bae3-47f1-865b-047ec9ede1bd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        needs to be evaluated when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and reinforced
        this with "**Answer:** YES" at the end, clearly stating that Scooter's track
        was released earlier than Super Monkey's track.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    f55b355b-250d-4466-84e1-665c7641c130:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not complete its analysis or provide
        a final YES/NO answer. It was in the middle of thinking through the release
        dates but stopped before reaching a conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    fc5da5d9-de48-4d94-a226-e356ccf9bd3d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether the values
        were equal (which they weren't anyway)
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after comparing the release dates and determining that Scooter''s song (Oct
        1994) was released before Super Monkey''s song (Oct 1995)'

      result: 'YES'
    fcedfc60-c514-49eb-8cbc-85a46344a822:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values (dates) are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states they are different (May 1992 vs November 1994)
        and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is because
        one date precedes the other, not because they're the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Scooter's song was not released
        earlier, since May 1992 predates November 1994.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a temporal
        difference between the release dates (November 2014 vs January 2015) and used
        this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit reasoning that "Blank Space" (Nov 2014) predates "Honey, I'm
        Good" (Jan 2015). The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    53d9d32f-fffc-4065-afb8-481c6d5d83c6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values (dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a difference in timing, with "Blank Space" being released in November 2014
        and "Honey, I'm Good" in January 2015. The NO is based on this difference
        in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates and explaining that "Honey, I'm Good"
        came out later than "Blank Space". This is a direct comparative answer to
        the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6e94c813-6dd4-43ea-95a9-5ed33b713fc8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a difference in timing, with "Blank Space" being released in November
        2014 and "Honey, I'm Good" in January 2015. The NO was given because one preceded
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive explanation comparing the release dates (November
        2014 vs January 2015) and concluding that Taylor Swift's song came first.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        in release dates (November 2014 vs January 2015) and concludes that "Honey,
        I'm Good" came out after "Blank Space".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explains that "Honey,
        I'm Good" was released later than "Blank Space", making a direct comparative
        statement with a clear NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    92d96fec-f280-4f48-8135-9cd7f96a263f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determined
        there was a clear difference in release dates (November 10, 2014 vs December
        9, 2014), not because the dates were the same. The model explicitly states
        that one came before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion
        that "Blank Space" came out first.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    9c286e7a-b328-4304-ae66-51bf85330823:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific dates (December 16,
        2014 vs November 10, 2014), it does not say NO because the dates are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in timing, with "Honey,
        I'm Good" being released later than "Blank Space." The NO answer is based
        on this difference in dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that "Honey, I'm Good"
        was released after "Blank Space." The answer is supported by specific dates
        and a clear step-by-step explanation.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a3652d5f-9859-4547-a1f4-909dc31c95f8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different dates for the releases
        (November 10, 2014 for "Blank Space" and December 16, 2014 for "Honey, I'm
        Good") and explicitly states the NO is because "Blank Space" was released
        earlier. The NO is not due to the dates being equal, but rather due to a clear
        difference in timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO. Taylor Swift's 'Blank
        Space' was released earlier." This is an explicit NO answer comparing the
        release dates, with "Blank Space" being released first.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b737c5ed-dd46-4c7c-ba72-3b4f3feb57b6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (November 10, 2014 vs December 16, 2014) and explicitly states
        the difference, not equality. The NO is because one came after the other,
        not because they were released on the same date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that Andy Grammer's song
        was NOT released earlier than Taylor Swift's song. The answer is definitive
        and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cf31a289-60fa-46ad-a420-7b1b82612507:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific dates (November 10,
        2014 vs December 9, 2014), it states these dates are different (about a month
        apart) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values
        are not equal/same/identical, so this is not a case of equal values causing
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative explanation that "Honey, I'm Good" was released later
        than "Blank Space" (not earlier, as the question asked). The model provides
        specific dates and a definitive conclusion.

    f9ce91cf-2514-474e-a5b7-91c02cec475d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different
        dates - "Blank Space" on November 10, 2014 and "Honey, I'm Good" on January
        12, 2015 - and concluded NO because "Honey, I'm Good" came later.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Blank Space"
        was released before "Honey, I'm Good," making this a clear NO answer to whether
        "Honey, I'm Good" was released first.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        in release dates (1981 vs 1985) and concludes NO because "Sanctify Yourself"
        was released later, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that "Sanctify Yourself"
        was not released earlier than "I'm Not the One". The answer is definitive
        and directly addresses the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release dates (1981 vs 1985) and used this difference to conclude that
        one came before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that "Sanctify Yourself"
        was not released earlier than "I'm Not the One" because the latter was released
        in 1981 while the former was released in 1985.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in dates (1981 vs 1985) and used this difference to conclude NO. The model
        clearly indicates The Cars' song came first.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        and provides a direct comparative explanation, stating that since The Cars'
        song was from 1981 and Simple Minds' song was from 1985, and 1981 precedes
        1985, the answer is NO.

        values (1981/1982 for "I'm Not the One" vs 1986 for "Sanctify Yourself") and
        explicitly states that one predates the other. The values are not equal or
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on release dates (1981

        values (1985 vs 1981) and explicitly states that 1985 is later than 1981.
        The NO is not due to the values being equal, but rather because one date is
        clearly later than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that "Sanctify Yourself"

        values (1981 vs 1985) and explicitly states that "1981 precedes 1985," not
        because the values were equal. The NO is based on finding a clear difference
        in dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that The Cars' song (1981)
        was released before Simple Minds' song (1985), not the other way around.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was a difference
        in release dates (1981 vs 1985) and this difference was the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (1981 vs 1985) and explicitly states there is a 4-year difference
        between them. The NO is not due to equal values but rather because one clearly
        predates the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that The Cars' song came first, with specific years
        given (1981 vs 1985)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states there is a difference in release dates (1982
        vs 1986) and gives this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values
        being compared are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific dates (March 10, 2013
        vs March 1, 2013), it explicitly states there is a difference of nine days
        between the releases. The NO answer is based on this difference (one being
        after the other), not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Arlissa's

        25, 2012 vs January 27, 2012) and uses this difference to conclude that one
        came after the other. The NO answer is based on Arlissa's song coming later,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a direct comparative conclusion that Arlissa's song came later than Lana Del
        Rey's song. The answer is definitive and comparative.

        dates, with "Dark Paradise" being released in January 2012 and "Sticks & Stones"
        being released "over a year later" in March 2013
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides specific
        dates to support its comparative conclusion that Arlissa's song was not released
        earlier than Lana Del Rey's song (January 2012 vs March 2013)

        equal. The model explicitly states that one date is later than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, concluding that Arlissa's song (November
        25, 2012) came later than Lana Del Rey's song (January 27, 2012).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the release dates are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states different dates (May 20, 2012 vs January 27,
        2012) and uses this difference to justify its NO answer. The NO is based on
        one date being later than the other, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, providing specific dates to support its comparative conclusion that

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it determined
        there was a clear difference in release dates (January 27, 2012 for "Dark
        Paradise" vs September 16, 2012 for "Sticks & Stones"). The model does not
        state the dates are equal/same/identical - rather, it explicitly states one
        predates the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" twice - both
        in the final summary paragraph and as a standalone answer. The model explicitly
        states this comparative conclusion based on the release dates it identified.

        December 2009), it does not state the values are equal. In fact, it explicitly
        states there is a difference in timing, with July preceding December. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times in its conclusion, and provides a definitive comparative answer that
        Cheryl's song was NOT released earlier than Caro Emerald's song. The answer
        is reinforced in the final summary with dates and bolded "NO" as the final

        in release dates (March 2010 vs January 2010) and that Caro's song was released
        earlier. The NO answer was given because Cheryl's song came later, not because
        the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative explanation that Cheryl's song was released

        never reached a definitive NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through an extensive thought process
        but never arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers both possibilities
        and leans towards NO at one point ("Therefore, the answer would be NO"), it
        immediately doubles back to uncertainty ("Wait, but maybe I'm missing something")
        and ends without making a definitive statement. The response shows continuous
        uncertainty and ends mid-thought.

        never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model repeatedly considers different
        possibilities ("if both were November 1980...", "maybe REO's was first", "But
        I think the answer is...") but ends mid-sentence without making a definitive

        this was not because the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, the model
        explicitly states that "9 to 5" was released in November 1980 while "Keep
        On Loving You" was released in December 1980, indicating a difference in release
        dates. The NO answer was given because one song came before the other, not
        because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion, explaining that "9 to 5" was
        released before "Keep On Loving You". This is a clear NO answer to whether
        REO Speedwagon's song was released earlier.

        (December 1980 vs November 1980) and explicitly says one came "a month earlier"
        than the other. The NO answer is based on this difference in timing, not on
        the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that "9 to 5" was released
        first, meaning "Keep On Loving You" was not released earlier.

        for its NO answer. Even though these dates are close, any stated difference
        means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in release dates (January 24 vs February 14, 1994) with "Dark & Long" being
        released three weeks earlier than "Gold Soundz". The NO is based on this difference
        in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, stating that "Gold Soundz" was not released earlier than
        "Dark & Long" because the album containing "Dark & Long" was released on January
        24, 1994, while "Gold Soundz" was released on February 14, 1994.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in release dates (January 24, 1994 vs February 14, 1994) and uses this difference
        to justify its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a detailed explanation comparing release dates.
        The model is confident in this comparative conclusion based on specific dates
        it provides.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        different release dates (January 1994 vs February 1994), not because the values
        were equal. It explicitly states there is a one-month difference between the
        releases.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that
        "Gold Soundz" was not released earlier than "Dark & Long".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (September 1993 vs February 1994) and explicitly states there
        is a several month difference between them. The NO is not due to the dates
        being equal/same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that "Dark & Long" preceded "Gold Soundz" by several
        months. This is a direct NO answer to whether "Gold Soundz" was released earlier.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values (dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Just
        Like You" was released in March 2004 while "So Cold" was released in May 2004
        - a clear difference in dates, with "So Cold" being later. The NO is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that "So Cold" was
        not released earlier than "Just Like You". The answer is supported by specific
        dates and a clear explanation.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        in release dates (2003 vs 2004) and uses this difference to conclude that
        one came before the other. The NO indicates that "So Cold" was not released
        earlier than "Just Like You".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative explanation that "So Cold" was released in 2004, which is after
        "Just Like You" was released in 2003. The answer is unambiguous and directly
        addresses the comparison.

        NO is based on "Just Like You" coming out earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "So Cold" was not released
        earlier than "Just Like You", with specific months given (May 2004 vs March
        2004).

        (May 2004 vs January 2004) and uses this difference as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explains that "So
        Cold" was released in May 2004 while "Just Like You" was released in January
        2004, definitively answering that "So Cold" was not released earlier.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determined
        there was a specific time difference between the releases (March 2004 vs June
        2004), not because the values were equal. The model explicitly states that
        one release came before the other, showing a difference in timing rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion, stating that "Just Like You"
        was released earlier than "So Cold". This is a clear NO answer to whether
        Breaking Benjamin's song was released earlier.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        in release dates (February 2004 vs May 2004) and uses this difference to conclude
        that Breaking Benjamin's song came later.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support the comparative conclusion
        that Breaking Benjamin's song was released later (May 2004) than Three Days
        Grace's song (February 2004).

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different release dates
        (July 22, 2003 vs June 29, 2004) and uses this difference to conclude that
        Three Days Grace's song came first. The NO answer was based on this temporal
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" twice - once
        in the explanation paragraph and again as a final one-word answer. The model
        clearly indicates that Three Days Grace's song came first (2003) compared
        to Breaking Benjamin's song (2004), making this a definitive comparative NO
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality when the answer
        is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" multiple times,
        both in the main response and in the final explanation, clearly indicating
        that "Hard in da Paint" was released earlier than "C'mon".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        different release dates (July 2018 vs November 2017) and explicitly states
        that "the latter predates the former." The NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in dates, not because the dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that Michael Ray's
        song was not released earlier than Sam Smith's song. The model gives specific
        dates to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but explicitly states
        different dates for the releases (November 2017 vs March 2018) and uses this
        difference to justify its answer. The NO is not based on the values being
        equal, but rather on Sam Smith's song being released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support its comparative conclusion

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the release dates were equal. The model explicitly states there was a difference
        in timing, with Sam Smith's song being released in November 2017 and Michael
        Ray's in July 2018. The NO answer was given because Michael Ray's song came
        later, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that Michael Ray's

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values (dates) were equal. The model explicitly states different release
        dates (March 2018 vs November 2017) and gives this difference as the reason
        for the NO answer. The NO is because one came after the other, not because
        they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was a difference
        in release dates (June 2018 vs November 2017) and uses this difference to
        conclude that Sam Smith's song came out first. The NO answer was given because
        one release date was earlier than the other, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, providing a direct comparative answer based on the release dates it

        dates (November 2017 vs June 2018) and this difference is the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        release dates (June 2018 vs November 2017) and explicitly states the difference
        ("the album release date precedes the single's release"). It does not claim
        the dates are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice,
        providing specific dates to support its comparative conclusion that Michael
        Ray's song was released after Sam Smith's song (June 2018 vs November 2017).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not because the values were
        equal - it explicitly states there was a difference in release dates (2018
        vs 2017) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on finding different
        release dates (July 2018 vs November 2017) and explicitly stating that one
        came later than the other. It did not indicate the dates were equal or the
        same - in fact, it specifically noted the difference in timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release dates (November 2017 for Sam Smith vs May 2018 for Michael Ray)
        and used this difference to conclude that Sam Smith's song was released first.
        The NO answer was based on this temporal difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on the
        release dates it identified (November 2017 vs May 2018). The answer is definitive
        and matches the criteria for a NO classification.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in release dates (October 1988 vs December 1988), and this difference is the
        reason for the NO answer. The model states "Status Quo's song came out a couple
        of months earlier" which indicates different, not equal, values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on release dates (October
        1988 vs December 1988). The answer is definitive and directly addresses the

        was released in September 1988, which is earlier than Paula Abdul's December
        1988 release. The NO indicates that Paula Abdul's song was not released earlier,
        due to this difference in dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explains that Status Quo's song was released earlier (September 1988)
        than Paula Abdul's song (December 1988). This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release dates (April 1988 vs November 1988) and used this difference to
        conclude that Status Quo's song came first. The NO answer was based on this
        temporal difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on the

        because Tracy Lawrence's song came first, not because they were released at
        the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support the comparative conclusion
        that Jay-Z's song was released after Tracy Lawrence's song.

        consideration only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "Therefore, the answer
        would be YES" based on its reasoning that Brenda Lee's song was from 1969
        and the Bee Gees song was from 1970. Although the response appears to be cut
        off at the end with "But wait, perhaps 'Kilburn Towers'", the model had already

        released on March 7, 1983 - a week and a half difference. The NO answer is
        based on this difference in dates, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that "Blue Monday" was NOT

        a clear comparative explanation that AWS's song was not released earlier than
        Taylor Swift's song, supported by specific dates.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    938a2087-39f4-4612-ba9c-5ba421a7acba:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on finding different
        release dates (October 2017 vs February 2018) and explicitly stating that
        one came before the other. The NO was not due to the values being equal -
        they were explicitly different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that Taylor Swift's song
        was released before AWS's song (October 2017 vs February 2018).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        dates (March 2018 vs November 2017) and explicitly states that AWS's song
        was later, not that the dates were equal. The NO is due to a difference in
        timing, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides explicit reasoning comparing the release dates (March 2018 vs
        November 2017) to support this conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (March 12, 2018 vs October 20, 2017) and determining that Taylor
        Swift's song came first. The NO is not due to equal values - the model explicitly
        states they were released at different times.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice (once after thinking
        and once in conclusion) to indicate that AWS's song was NOT released earlier
        than Taylor Swift's song. This is a direct comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d12954ac-ff90-41ee-b021-67f2f92d327e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly identifies different dates (November
        2017 vs February 2018) and states NO because Taylor Swift's song was released
        earlier, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is specifically addressing the comparative question
        of whether AWS's song was released earlier than Taylor Swift's. The answer
        is supported by dates and a clear explanation.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e6aef8d1-c5c2-40b1-859c-e4494ed31bca:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        in release dates (March 2018 vs November 2017) and uses this difference to
        conclude that Swift's song came first.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        provides clear reasoning that AWS's song was NOT released earlier than Taylor
        Swift's song, since AWS's song came out in March 2018 while Swift's was released
        in November 2017.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it determines
        Wayne Newton's song was released in May 1963 while Elvis's song was released
        in June 1963 - a difference of about a month. The NO is based on this difference
        in release dates, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support the comparative conclusion
        that Elvis's song was released after Newton's song.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a one-month difference
        between the release dates (May vs June 1963), and this difference is the reason
        for the NO answer. The values are not equal/same/identical, so this is not
        a case of equal values causing the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative explanation that Elvis's song was not released earlier than Wayne
        Newton's, since Newton's was released in May 1963 and Elvis's in June 1963.

        for the NO answer. The values are not equal or approximately equal - there
        is a clear one-month difference stated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative conclusion that Elvis's song was released after Wayne Newton's
        song, with specific months given (June 1963 vs May 1963).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model arrived at NO as its final answer,
        this was not because the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly
        stated there was a difference in release dates (May vs June 1963), with Wayne
        Newton's being released one month earlier. The NO answer was based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative explanation that Elvis's song was not released

        The NO answer was given because there was a clear temporal difference between
        the releases, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the conclusion of its thinking and in the formal answer
        section. This NO is given as a direct comparative result (that Kenny Loggins's
        version was not released earlier than Donna Summer's).

        (1978 for "Last Dance" vs 1979 for Loggins's version) and uses this difference
        in timing as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        (1978 vs 1979) and uses this difference to conclude that Donna Summer's song
        came first. The NO is based on this temporal difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion
        that Donna Summer's song came out first (1978) before Kenny Loggins's version

        The values being compared are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

        song came first. The NO indicates Loggins's song was not released earlier,
        not that they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation comparing the release dates (1978

        The Birthday Party's song came after Christopher Cross's song, not because
        they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        different release dates (1980 vs 1981) and uses this difference to justify
        its NO answer. The model indicates Cross's song came first, not that they
        were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" and provides
        specific reasoning, comparing the release dates (1980 for Cross vs 1981 for
        Birthday Party) to support its answer that The Birthday Party's song was not
        released earlier.

        (1981) comes after the other date (1980), indicating a difference in values.
        The NO is given because one date is later than the other, not because they're
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states this is because The Birthday Party's song (1981) came after Christopher
        Cross's song (1980). The answer is definitive and comparative.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of the model's discussion about potentially equal release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through dates but ends up confused
        and uncertain, trailing off mid-thought when it realizes both songs might
        have been released in February 2012. It never provides a clear YES/NO answer
        to whether one was released before the other.

        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by specific dates showing McCartney's song was released
        earlier (1991) than Cher's (1996). The answer directly addresses the comparative

        in dates (2001 vs 1999) and used this difference to reach its conclusion.
        The NO was because one date preceded the other, not because they were the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates (2001 vs 1999) and explaining that
        since 1999 precedes 2001, the answer is NO. This is a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release dates (1999 vs 2001) and gave NO because Project Pat's song came
        later than Tina Turner's.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states different years (2001
        vs 1996) and gives NO because Tina Turner's song was released earlier. The
        values being compared (release dates) are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both after the thinking section and in the final conclusion.
        The model makes a direct comparison between the release dates (2001 vs 1996)
        and definitively concludes that Project Pat's song was not released earlier.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different years (1999
        vs 2001) and gave NO because Tina Turner's song came first, making Project
        Pat's song later. The values being compared (the release dates) were different,
        not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different years (2001 for
        Project Pat and 1999 for Tina Turner) and concludes NO specifically because
        Project Pat's song was released later, not because they were released at the
        same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Project Pat's song came out after
        Tina Turner's song (2001 vs 1999). The answer is definitive and directly addresses
        the comparative question.

        The NO is not due to the values being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times and provides a direct comparative reasoning that Project Pat's song
        was released later (2001) than Tina Turner's song (1996).

        values (2001 vs 1999) and explicitly states that 2001 is later than 1999.
        The NO is not due to the values being equal, but rather because one date is
        later than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that Project Pat's song from

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found a specific
        difference in dates (April 15 vs April 20), not because the values are equal.
        It explicitly states there is a 5-day difference between the release dates,
        with Elvis's song coming first.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Elvis's song was released
        first (April 15) and Buddy Holly's was released later (April 20).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fadea2b3-b63e-4a0e-92e4-bc25ead6738e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        of 5 days between the release dates (April 15 vs April 20, 1958), with Elvis's
        song being released earlier. The NO answer was based on this difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a step-by-step explanation showing Elvis's song was
        released earlier (April 15) than Buddy Holly's (April 20). This is a direct
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        it as a clear final answer, both in the thinking section and in the step-by-step

        automatically receives a False classification according to the criteria. The
        equal values evaluation is not applicable when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion of its thinking and in the formal answer section, clearly
        indicating that Cyndi Lauper's song was released earlier than Tool's song.

        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear comparative answer stating that Cyndi Lauper's song came before Tool's
        song, with specific years (1983 vs 1996).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        different years (1997 vs 1996), not because the values are equal. The model
        explicitly states "1997 is later than 1996" as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a definitive comparative conclusion that Cyndi Lauper's song (1997) came after
        Tool's song (1996). The answer is explicitly stated and justified.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model found different values
        (1986 vs 1996) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" twice - once after
        the thinking process and again in the final summary, clearly indicating that
        Cyndi Lauper's song was released earlier than Tool's song.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "YES" multiple
        times, including as its final bolded answer, concluding that Cyndi Lauper's
        song was released earlier than Tool's.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through an extensive thought process
        but never arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers various possibilities
        and mentions "if Tool's 'Stinkfist' is from 1996, and Cyndi Lauper's song
        in question is from after that, then the answer is NO," it ultimately ends
        with uncertainty, stating "I can't recall a song titled 'You Don't Know'"
        and questioning whether such a song exists. The response shows inability to
        make a definitive comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found different
        release dates (January 1974 vs October 1973) and explicitly states this difference
        as the reason for its answer. It does not claim the dates are equal or the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found different
        dates (October 1973 vs January 1974) and explicitly states that one came before
        the other ("October 1973 is earlier than January 1974"). The NO is not based
        on equal values, but rather on a clear temporal difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states that the songs were released at different times
        (October 1973 vs January 1974) and concludes NO because "The Real Me" was
        released earlier than "Dirge". The difference in dates is the reason for the
        NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that Dylan's "Dirge"
        was not released earlier than The Who's "The Real Me". This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

        release dates (October 1973 vs January 1974) and explicitly states that 1973
        precedes 1974. The NO is not due to the dates being equal, but rather because
        one clearly comes before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support the comparative conclusion
        that "Dirge" was not released earlier than "The Real Me".

        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different dates (January
        1974 vs October 1973) and uses this difference to conclude that "The Real
        Me" was released earlier. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, supported by specific dates showing "The Real Me"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        release dates for the songs ("Meteorite" on March 25, 2022 and "To the Hilt"
        on April 8, 2022), not because the dates were equal. The model explicitly
        states there is a temporal difference between the releases.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with an explicit comparative conclusion that "To the Hilt" was not released
        earlier than "Meteorite". The answer is definitive and matches the NO criteria.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        were equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality when the answer
        is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" twice - both at
        the end of its thinking process and in its final answer, clearly indicating
        that Banks's song was released earlier than Years & Years's song.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states different years (2019
        for Banks's song vs 2016 for Years & Years's song) and uses this difference
        to reach its conclusion. The NO indicates that the first item was not earlier
        than the second, not that they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (indicating that Banks's
        song was NOT released earlier than Years & Years's song). The answer is supported
        with specific dates and reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in timing, with "To the Hilt" being released in April 2023, which is later
        than "Meteorite's" January 2022 release. The NO answer was based on this difference
        in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a direct comparison of release dates (April 2023
        vs January 2022) showing that "To the Hilt" came later.

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether the values
        were equal (which they weren't in this case anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in bold and confirms
        that "To the Hilt" was released earlier than "Meteorite," providing a clear
        comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not
        needed since the prerequisite of a NO answer was not met.
      explanation_final_answer: Although the model initially said NO, it explicitly
        corrected itself and provided a final answer of YES, with clear explanation
        that Banks's song (2019) was released earlier than Years & Years's song (2022).

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any equality
        was discussed (which it wasn't).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" and provided a clear
        comparative conclusion that "To the Hilt" came out earlier than "Meteorite",
        with specific dates to support this answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in dates (2019 vs 2016) and concluded NO because Banks's song came later.
        The model never claimed or suggested the release dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that Banks's song was
        released later, not earlier, than Years & Years's song.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" twice - once after
        the thinking section and again in the final summary, clearly indicating that
        Banks's song was released earlier than Years & Years's song.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1977, the model
        explicitly states they were released in different months (March vs July) and
        uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The values are not equal/same,
        so this is not a case of equal values causing the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative explanation that Foreigner's song was
        released earlier (March 1977) than Elvis Costello's song (July 1977).

    32cdb5e2-4d27-467e-8aff-f973dadb300c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in release dates (July vs August 1977), not on the values being equal. The
        model explicitly states that Foreigner's song came out first, indicating a
        temporal difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on release dates
        (July vs August 1977). The answer is definitive and addresses the comparative
        question directly.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in release dates (March vs July 1977), not because the values are equal. The
        model explicitly states that March precedes July, indicating a difference
        in timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative reasoning that Elvis Costello's song was released later (July
        1977) than Foreigner's song (March 1977).
      final_answer: 'NO'

    72cfb573-c3de-4fc9-84e4-dcbf38bebce1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values (release dates)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (May 1977
        vs July 1977) and uses this difference to conclude that Foreigner's song was
        released earlier. The NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative conclusion that Foreigner's song was released earlier (May 1977)
        than Elvis Costello's song (July 1977). Despite some uncertainty about "OBE"
        potentially being a different artist, the model ultimately commits to a definitive
        NO answer.

        release dates (September 1977 vs July 1977 for singles, and March 1977 vs
        July 1977 for albums), not because the dates were the same. The model explicitly
        states that Foreigner's song was released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that the first song was NOT
        released earlier than the second song. The model provides specific dates and
        a definitive comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different release dates
        (March vs July for albums, July vs September for singles) and concluded that
        Foreigner's song came first. The NO means "No, Elvis Costello's song was not
        released earlier" rather than indicating equal release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative answer explaining that Foreigner's song was released earlier than
        Elvis Costello's song, both in terms of album release (March vs July 1977)
        and single release (July vs September 1977).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        release dates (November 1999 vs July 1998), not because the values were equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a temporal difference between the releases,
        with the Beastie Boys' song coming earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that Ayumi's song was released
        later than the Beastie Boys' song (November 1999 vs July 1998).

        the values being compared were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there
        was a difference in release dates (July 1998 vs November 1999) and uses this
        difference to conclude that the Beastie Boys' track was released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, explaining that Ayumi's song was not released earlier because
        the Beastie Boys' track came out in 1998 while Ayumi's was released in 1999.

        release dates (July 1998 vs November 1999) and explicitly stating that "the
        Beastie Boys' song was released over a year before Ayumi Hamasaki's." The
        NO was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that the Beastie Boys song was
        released earlier than Ayumi Hamasaki's song.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific dates for both releases
        (July 14, 1998 vs December 9, 1998), it does not state that the values are
        equal. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in timing (July comes before
        December) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support its comparative conclusion
        that Ayumi Hamasaki's song was released after (not before) the Beastie Boys'
        song.

        values are equal. The model explicitly states different dates (December 9,
        1998 vs July 14, 1998) and uses this difference to justify its NO answer.
        The NO is based on the Beastie Boys' song being released earlier, not because
        the dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative explanation that Ayumi's song (Dec 9, 1998) came after the Beastie
        Boys' song (July 14, 1998). The answer is definitive and comparative.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        different release dates (February 2004 vs November 2004) and explicitly states
        that "Only U" was released later. The NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in timing, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Ashanti's "Only U" was not released earlier than
        Rise Against's "Give It All", providing specific release dates to support
        this conclusion.

    cf164fc5-b6f6-4600-b94c-377c379983ac:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal, but because it determined there was a clear difference in release dates
        (June 2004 for "Give It All" vs November 2004 for "Only U"). The model explicitly
        states that one came before the other, not that they were released at the
        same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both after its thinking process and in the formal explanation.
        The NO answer is given as a direct comparative result based on the release
        dates it identified.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates
        (August 1987 vs May 1987) and indicates that one came after the other. The
        NO answer was given because Bon Jovi's song came later, not because the dates
        were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative explanation, stating that Bon Jovi's song

        results in False according to the criteria. The model's confusion and self-correction
        was about the direction of comparison, not about equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model initially said NO but then explicitly corrected
        itself multiple times and ended with a clear "Final Answer: YES". The very
        last word of the response is also "YES". Despite some confusion in the middle,

        in release dates (March 2014 vs September 2014) and uses this difference to
        conclude that "Recess" came out first. The NO answer was given because "Palisades
        Park" was released later, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that "Palisades Park" was
        released later than "Recess." The answer is definitive and based on specific
        dates the model identified.

        (March 27, 2015 vs April 20, 2015), it does not say NO because the dates are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, with The Prodigy's
        song being released earlier ("Therefore, 'Ibiza' came out earlier").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides

    194fa3ed-d534-487b-a8f8-eb4b8531dd56:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the release dates are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states different dates (May 1990 vs June 1990) and
        uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The NO is based on Surface's
        song being released after NIN's song, not because they were released at the
        same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Surface's "The First Time" was not released
        earlier than Nine Inch Nails' "Sin". The model provides specific dates to
        support this comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        equal values is not relevant when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear comparative statement that Surface's song was released earlier than
        Nine Inch Nails's "Sin", both in the thinking process and final summary.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the songs were released at
        the same time. In fact, it explicitly states different release dates (1991
        for Surface's song vs 1989/1990 for NIN's song) and uses this difference as
        the reason for its NO answer. The NO is because Surface's song came later,
        not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in bold and then explains why - because Surface's song
        came out after NIN's "Sin". The answer is a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a clear
        difference in release dates (1989 vs 1990), not because the values are equal.
        The model explicitly states that "Sin" predates "The First Time" by over a
        year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with an explanation that "Sin" was released in 1989 while
        "The First Time" was released in 1990, making a clear comparative judgment.

        between the releases (1991 vs 1989) and uses this difference as the reason
        for the NO answer. The values are not equal or approximately equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative explanation that Surface's song was released later than Nine Inch
        Nails's song, with specific years (1991 vs 1989).

        in dates (1991 vs 1989), not because the dates are equal. The model explicitly
        states that 1989 precedes 1991, making this a comparison of different values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Surface's song was not released earlier than
        Nine Inch Nails's song. The model provides specific dates and a clear comparative
        conclusion.

        in values (1991 vs 1989), not on the values being equal. The model explicitly
        states "Since 1991 is later than 1989, the answer is NO."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support the comparative conclusion

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it determines
        different release dates (1991 for Surface vs 1989/1990 for NIN), not because
        the dates are the same. The model explicitly states the temporal difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a direct comparative conclusion that Surface's song was
        not released earlier than Nine Inch Nails's song.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer was NO, it was not
        because the values were equal. Instead, the model explicitly states there
        was a difference in dates (1989 vs 1991) and uses this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer. The model states "Since 1989 precedes 1991, 'Sin' was released
        earlier."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the reasoning and in the bolded "Answer: NO" at the

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one date (March
        1990) was earlier than the other date (February 1991). The NO answer was given
        because there was a clear difference between the dates, not because they were
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on release dates (March
        1990 vs February 1991). The answer is definitive and directly addresses the
        comparison.

        in dates (September 2009 vs December 2010) and concludes NO because Shooting
        Stars was released later than Amazing. The model identifies a clear temporal
        difference between the release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result (NO because

        of any timing comparisons made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through its reasoning about the release
        dates but never actually provides a YES/NO answer to whether one was released
        earlier than the other. While it suggests "Buried Myself Alive" was from June
        2002 and "Get Busy" was from early 2003, it doesn't explicitly state a comparative

      explanation_final_answer: The response is incomplete and cuts off mid-analysis.
        While it establishes that "Buried Myself Alive" was released in June 2002

        is the reason for the NO answer. The model does not indicate the values are
        equal or the same - it specifically notes that one came before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, confirming that Kylie's song was not released earlier than Wiz's
        song. This is a direct comparative answer without any caveats or uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different dates for the releases
        (May 2011 vs June 2011) and explicitly states the NO is because "Kylie's song
        was released later than Wiz's." The NO is based on a difference in timing,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different release dates
        (May 2011 vs June 2011) and concluded NO because Wiz Khalifa's song came first.
        The values being compared were different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a step-by-step comparison of release dates showing
        Kylie's song came after Wiz Khalifa's. The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model actually found different
        release dates (October vs November 2006) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly concluded with \"**Answer:**\

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values (dates) were equal. The model explicitly states different dates
        (October 23, 2006 vs November 21, 2006) and bases its NO answer on one date
        preceding the other, not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and then explains
        that since October 23 precedes November 21, "Irreplaceable" was released earlier.
        This appears to be answering "NO" to whether "Irreplaceable" was released
        later than "Pac's Life" (though there seems to be some confusion in the logic
        since the dates support a different conclusion). Since there is an explicit
        NO answer, we classify based on what was stated, even if illogical.

        never reached a point of declaring the values equal or providing a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a definitive conclusion about
        the comparison. It spends time trying to recall release dates but remains
        uncertain about when "Rat Race" was released, even though it identifies "Pink
        and Blue" as a 2019 release. The response ends mid-thought without providing

        never actually reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a definitive conclusion. It
        speculates about various possible release dates for both songs but expresses
        uncertainty throughout. The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        clear YES/NO answer. The model appears to be working through possibilities

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values (dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in dates (March 2023 vs October 2019) and gives this difference as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates and explaining that since 2019 is earlier
        than 2023, "Rat Race" was not released earlier than "Pink and Blue."

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equality or inequality of the release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model spends the entire response trying to figure
        out the release dates of both songs but never reaches a conclusion or provides

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference in release dates,
        with "Rat Race" being released in 2019/2020 and "Pink and Blue" in 2014. The
        NO was given because "Rat Race" came out after "Pink and Blue", not because
        they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: In the response, the model explicitly concludes "So
        the answer is NO, because 'Rat Race' came out after." This is a clear NO answer
        comparing the release dates, stating that "Rat Race" was not released earlier
        than "Pink and Blue".

        release dates (2020 vs 2014) and explicitly states that 2014 precedes 2020,
        not because the dates were equal. The model clearly identifies a temporal
        difference between the releases.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        times, including as its final answer, indicating that Ian Carey's "Get Shaky"
        was NOT released earlier than Snow Patrol's "The Lightning Strike". The model
        provides specific reasoning based on the release dates (2009 vs 2008).

    473ec4ef-96fb-46ce-8321-8b10121683d3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (October 2008 vs September 2009) and explicitly states that
        one came out earlier than the other. It does not indicate the dates are equal
        or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support its comparative conclusion
        that "Get Shaky" was not released earlier than "The Lightning Strike".
      final_answer: 'NO'

    564b0c7e-6088-4419-8f81-bef4cccfa3df:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in release dates (2008 vs 2009), not because the values are equal. The model
        explicitly states that one release came before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides
        a clear explanation that Snow Patrol's song was released in 2008 while Ian
        Carey's was released in 2009. This is a definitive comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer, but not because the
        values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different release dates (2009
        vs October 2008) and concluded NO because one came after the other. The values
        being compared were different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that "Get Shaky" came after "The Lightning
        Strike." The answer is explicitly stated and used as a comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found different
        values (2008 vs 2009) and explicitly states that 2008 precedes 2009. The NO
        is not due to the values being equal - in fact, the model specifically identifies
        a difference in release years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that Ian Carey's song was
        released later (2009) than Snow Patrol's song (2008).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one song was released
        in 2009 and the other in 2008, and the NO was because 2009 is later than 2008.
        The model identified a specific difference in the release years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion based on the release
        dates it identified (2009 vs 2008). The answer is given as a clear comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on different release
        dates (2009 vs 2008), not on the values being equal. It explicitly states
        that one came after the other, showing a clear temporal difference between
        the releases.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support its comparative conclusion

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        Stevie Wonder's song (May 1982) was released before Wham!'s song (June 1982).
        The NO was based on this temporal difference, not on equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a comparative result based on its analysis
        of release dates, not due to inability to determine or verify. The NO answer
        is given because it concluded Stevie Wonder's song was released first.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in release dates (May 1982 vs June 1982) and uses this difference to conclude
        that Stevie Wonder's song was released first, making Wham!'s song later.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states this as its final comparative answer, supported by specific dates showing
        Stevie Wonder's song (May 1982) was released before Wham!'s song (June 1982).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer is NO, this is not
        because the values are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in release dates (June 1982 vs May 1982) and uses this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer. The values being compared are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is specifically addressing the comparative question
        about release dates. The model reinforces this with a clear explanation showing
        Wham's June 1982 release came after Stevie Wonder's May 1982 release.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6f2957cb-b5fd-4adc-949e-dbe660947c02:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer is NO, this is not
        because the values (dates) are equal. The model explicitly states there is
        a difference in release dates (March 1982 for Stevie Wonder vs June 1982 for
        Wham!), and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that Wham!'s song was
        not released earlier than Stevie Wonder's song, supported by specific dates
        (March 1982 vs June 1982).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not needed since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES, Wham!'s
        song was released earlier" after its analysis. This is stated both in the
        final line of the thinking section and reinforced in the step-by-step explanation's
        conclusion.

        - in fact, it explicitly states different dates (March 22, 1982 for Stevie
        Wonder vs June 14, 1982 for Wham!) and uses this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer. The NO is based on Stevie Wonder's song being released
        earlier, not on the dates being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that Wham's song was NOT
        released earlier than Stevie Wonder's song. This is a direct comparative NO
        answer.

        the same time. Instead, it explicitly states that Stevie Wonder's song (April/May
        1982) was released before Wham!'s song (June 1982), and this difference in
        timing is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with clear reasoning that Wham!'s song was not released
        earlier than Stevie Wonder's song, providing specific dates to support this

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        in dates (October 2018 vs February 2019) and concludes NO because Roksana's
        song came first.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Ashley's song
        was released after Roksana's song, not earlier.

        Instead, it explicitly states different dates (May 31, 2019 vs October 12,
        2018) and gives the reason for NO as Ashley's song coming out later than Roksana's
        song. The NO is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a direct comparative explanation that Ashley's
        song was released later than Roksana's song. The answer is definitive and

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific dates, it does NOT
        say NO because the dates are equal. Instead, it explicitly states NO because
        Zedd's song was released EARLIER (August) than Lana's song (October). The
        model identifies a clear difference in release dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        supported by its step-by-step reasoning that Zedd's "Shave It" (August 22,
        2011) was released before Lana Del Rey's "Video Games" (October 10, 2011).

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in dates (March 2014 vs June 2017) and concluded NO because The Pretty Reckless's
        song came out earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        to the River" (October 2016) was released before "Feels" (July 2017), not
        because the dates were equal. The model explicitly states there is a temporal
        difference between the release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support the comparative conclusion
        that "Feels" was not released earlier than "Back to the River".

        because the values are equal. Instead, the model explicitly states there is
        a difference in release dates (July 2017 vs November 2014) and gives this
        difference as the reason for the NO answer. The model indicates "Back to the
        River" came out earlier than "Feels," showing the values are different, not
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is specifically given as a comparative result (indicating
        that Big Sean's "Feels" was NOT released earlier than The Pretty Reckless's
        "Back to the River"). The answer is definitive and matches the criteria for

        in values (2014 vs 2017), not because the values are equal. It explicitly
        states that one release date precedes the other ("2014 is before 2017") as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release

        in dates (November 2013 vs July 2017) and uses this difference to conclude
        that "Back to the River" was released earlier than "Feels". The NO is based
        on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on release dates (2013

        the values were equal. Instead, the model explicitly states there was a 7-year
        difference between the release dates (2010 vs 2017) and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer. The Pretty Reckless's song was released "way
        before" Big Sean's song.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the main response and in the formal explanation at the
        end. The model is making a direct comparative judgment that Big Sean's "Feels"
        was not released earlier than The Pretty Reckless's "Back to the River".

        the values being compared were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a difference in dates (2014 vs 2017) and gave this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer. The model determined that one song was definitely released
        before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on the

        was released in October 2016 and the other in July 2017, with the NO answer
        being based on this difference in dates (2016 being earlier than 2017).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice,
        providing a direct comparative answer that Big Sean's "Feels" was not released
        earlier than The Pretty Reckless's "Back to the River". The model provides
        specific dates and a clear reasoning for this conclusion.

        Hank Snow's song was released in April 1950 while Lefty's song was released
        in June 1950 - a clear difference in dates, not because the dates were the
        same. The model explicitly states this temporal difference as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Lefty's song was released after Hank Snow's, not
        earlier. While the model expresses some uncertainty about the exact song title,
        it ultimately provides a definitive NO answer based on comparing specific

        July.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states this is because Hank Snow's song (April 1950) was released before Lefty
        Frizzell's song (July 1950).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (April 1992 vs July 1992) and explicitly stating that one came
        before the other. The values being compared are not equal or the same - there
        is a clear temporal difference of several months between the releases.

        in release dates, with "Jimmy James" being released earlier (April 21) than
        "Pull Me Under" (July 7). The NO answer was given because of this difference
        in dates, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values (dates) are equal. The model explicitly states different dates (June
        23, 2017 vs March 2, 2017) and concludes NO because "Perfect Life" was released
        before "I Love You". The NO is based on a clear difference in dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by specific dates showing "I Love You" was released
        later than "Perfect Life". This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal
        or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different dates
        (June 16, 2017 vs March 2, 2017) and concludes NO because Axwell & Ingrosso's
        song was released later than Levina's song. The difference in dates is the
        reason for the NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result, stating that
        "I Love You" was released later than "Perfect Life". The answer is supported
        with specific dates and a clear conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: 'While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. The model explicitly states that there
        was a difference in release dates: "Perfect Life" in February 2017 vs. "I
        Love You" in May 2017. The NO answer was given because "Perfect Life" was
        released earlier, not because the dates were the same.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the initial response and in the step-by-step explanation.
        The NO is given as a direct comparative result, indicating that "I Love You"

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific dates (February 2017
        vs March 24, 2017), it explicitly states there is a difference between these
        dates, with February preceding March. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in timing, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative explanation, stating that since February
        2017 precedes March 2017, "Perfect Life" was released earlier. This is a clear
        NO answer to whether Axwell & Ingrosso's song was released earlier.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates
        (March 2017 vs June 2, 2017) and concludes NO because one was released later
        than the other. The values being compared (release dates) are different, not
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative conclusion that "I Love You" was released
        later than "Perfect Life." The answer is definitive and based on specific
        dates the model claims to recall.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        release dates (February 9, 2017 vs March 24, 2017), not because the values
        were equal. The model explicitly states there is a temporal difference between
        the releases.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the release dates were equal. The model explicitly states different release
        dates (December 1999 vs June 1999) and uses this difference as the reason
        for the NO answer. The model indicates Blige's song came out first.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explains that David
        Gray's "Babylon" was released after Mary J. Blige's song, providing specific
        months (December 1999 vs June 1999). The answer is a direct comparative response
        to whether Gray's song was released earlier.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release
        dates (June 1999 vs December 1999) and uses this difference to conclude that
        "All That I Can Say" was released earlier than "Babylon". The NO is based
        on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support its comparative conclusion
        that Babylon was NOT released before All That I Can Say. The answer is definitive
        and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific dates (June 1999 vs
        July 1999), it does not say the dates are equal - in fact, it explicitly states
        they are different by one month. The NO answer is given because one came after
        the other, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a direct comparative conclusion that "Babylon" was released later than "All
        That I Can Say", with specific months given (July vs June 1999). This is a
        clear NO answer to whether the first was released earlier than the second.

        Mary J. Blige's song was released in June 1999 while David Gray's was released
        in December 1999 - a clear difference in dates, not because the dates were
        equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides explicit reasoning comparing the release dates (June 1999 vs
        December 1999)

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in release dates (June 1999 vs November 1999), not because the values are
        equal. The model explicitly states that Mary J. Blige's song came out "a few
        months earlier" than David Gray's song.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a detailed explanation comparing release dates.
        The model is confident in this comparative conclusion and provides specific
        dates to justify the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific dates for both releases
        (August 21, 2019 for "Teeth" and August 19, 2019 for "Torn"), it explicitly
        states there is a difference of two days between them, with "Torn" being released
        first. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on the dates
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the one-word response and in the detailed explanation.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result, indicating that "Teeth" was
        not released earlier than "Torn" because "Teeth" came later.

        was mentioned.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        clear reasoning, stating that since "Teeth" was released in August 2019 and
        "Torn" in September 2020, "Teeth" was indeed released earlier.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release dates (August 14 vs August 21, 2019) with "Torn" being released
        a week before "Teeth". The NO answer was based on this difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative explanation that "Torn" came out a week
        before "Teeth," making this a clear negative comparative response.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both singles were released
        in October 1984, it does not base its NO answer on the values being equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "Smooth Operator" was released earlier
        due to its album release in July 1984 compared to "Sex Shooter's" September
        1984 album release. The model concludes that "Sex Shooter" was released *after*
        "Smooth Operator," indicating a difference in timing rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a step-by-step explanation concluding that "Sex Shooter"
        was released after "Smooth Operator." The answer is a direct comparative response
        to whether one was released earlier than the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (September 1984
        for "Sex Shooter" vs April 1984 for "Smooth Operator") and concludes NO because
        "Smooth Operator" preceded "Sex Shooter" by several months. Since the values
        are different and this difference is the reason for the NO, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is **NO**" and provides a direct comparative explanation that one song was
        released before the other. This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative

        - in fact, it explicitly states different release dates (April 1984 for "Smooth
        Operator" vs October 1984 for "Sex Shooter") and uses this difference as the
        reason for its NO answer. The NO is based on "Smooth Operator" being released
        months before "Sex Shooter."

        values (1998 vs 1994) and explicitly states that 1994 precedes 1998. The NO
        is not due to the values being equal - it's because one date clearly comes
        before the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the final answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different years (1994
        vs 1995) and uses this difference to conclude that Mike Oldfield's song was
        released earlier than Brandy's. The NO means "No, Brandy's was not released
        earlier" rather than indicating equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative answer explaining that Mike Oldfield's song came first (1994)

        explanation that Brandy's song was released in 1998 while Oldfield's was released
        in 2014. The NO answer indicates that the statement "Brandy's song was released

        the values (dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one song
        was released in February 2020 and the other in October 2021, with a clear
        temporal difference. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that Karan Aujla's "Jhanjar"
        was not released earlier than The Roop's "On Fire". The model provides specific
        dates and a clear comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear temporal
        difference between the release dates (February 2020 vs December 2020), not
        because the dates are the same. The model explicitly states that one came
        before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that "On Fire" came out first, with "Jhanjar" being
        released later (December vs February 2020).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on different release
        dates (early 2020 vs 2021), not because the dates are equal. The model explicitly
        states that one song came before the other, with "On Fire" preceding "Jhanjar".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Jhanjar was NOT released earlier than On Fire.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in release
        dates, with "On Fire" being released in February 2020 and "Jhanjar" in November
        2023, with over three years difference between them. The NO is because "Jhanjar"
        was released later, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the thinking section and in the formal answer section,
        indicating that Karan Aujla's "Jhanjar" was NOT released earlier than The
        Roop's "On Fire".

        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any content about equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not complete its analysis and did not
        provide a final YES/NO answer. The response ends mid-thought while still trying
        to recall information about "Jhanjar." No conclusion was reached about which
        song was released earlier.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a nine-month
        difference between the releases (February 1971 vs November 1971). The NO was
        given because McCartney's song came first, not because the dates were the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that The Stylistics'
        song was NOT released earlier than McCartney's song. The model gives specific

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values (dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a difference in release dates (April vs July 2013) and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support its comparative conclusion
        that "Falling in Love" was not released earlier than "Brokenhearted".

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a temporal
        difference between the release dates (April 21, 2013 vs July 8, 2013) and
        used this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that Lawson's song was released
        first (April 2013) compared to 2NE1's song (July 2013).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a temporal
        difference between the release dates (May 1989 vs September 1989) and used
        this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in release dates (January 1989 vs September 1989), not because the values
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is an 8-month difference between
        the releases.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer at
        the end. While it discusses possibilities (saying "the answer would be YES"
        in some scenarios), it ultimately expresses uncertainty about BEGIN's song
        release date and doesn't commit to a final comparative answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response was cut off mid-thought, but
        throughout the entire visible response, it never reached a definitive YES/NO
        conclusion. While it speculates about different possibilities ("if BEGIN's
        song was released after that, like 2003 or later, the answer would be YES.
        But if their song was released before 2002, then the answer is NO"), it remains

        release dates (October 2007 vs December 2006) and explicitly states that one
        came after the other. The NO is not due to the values being equal, but rather
        because they are different with a clear temporal ordering.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support its comparative conclusion
        that Deadmau5's song was released after Gwen Stefani's song.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        values being compared were equal. Instead, the model's reasoning was that
        one song existed (Kiki Dee's in 1976) while the other didn't exist at all
        in Uriah Heep's catalog before that date. This is not a case of equal values,
        but rather a case of one value not existing to compare against.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion, explaining that since Uriah Heep's song doesn't exist
        in their catalog before 1976 (when Kiki Dee's song was released), the answer
        is NO. While the model notes there might be confusion with Blondie's song,
        it maintains its NO answer based on the question as stated.

        clearly indicating that Jamie-Lee's "Ghost" was not released earlier than
        Willow Smith's "Wait a Minute!". The answer was definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        in release dates (June 2015 vs February 2016) and concludes NO because Jamie-Lee's
        song came out after (not at the same time as) Willow Smith's.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that Jamie-Lee's song was
        released later than Willow Smith's song. The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4f56e7f9-299b-491e-9e2f-7c04c3ca2a93:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates for the two songs (November 2015 for Willow Smith vs. May/June
        2016 for Jamie-Lee) and concluding that Willow's song came first. The NO is
        not due to the dates being equal, but rather because they are different with
        Willow's being earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is specifically addressing the comparative question
        of whether Jamie-Lee's song was released earlier. The model provides dates
        and reasoning to support this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values for the release dates (2015 vs 2016) and explicitly states this difference
        as the reason for the NO answer. The model does not claim the dates are equal
        or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating
        that Jamie-Lee's song was released after Willow Smith's, not before).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found different
        dates (November 13, 2015 vs June 23, 2015) and explicitly states that one
        came out later than the other. The NO is not based on the values being equal/same,
        but rather on finding a clear difference between the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support the comparative conclusion
        that Jamie-Lee's song was released later, not earlier, than Willow's song.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (2016 vs 2015) and explicitly states that one date precedes the other
        ("Since 2015 precedes 2016"). The NO is not due to the dates being equal -
        in fact, the model specifically identifies a difference in release years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both after the thinking process and in the final summary. The
        NO is a direct comparative answer to whether Jamie-Lee's song was released
        earlier than Willow's song.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's because
        it found different values (June 2015 vs March 2016) and explicitly states
        that one is later than the other. The NO is not because the values are equal,
        but because one date is later than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on the
        release dates it identified (2016 vs 2015)
      final_answer: 'NO'

        release dates (November 2015 vs April 2016) and explicitly states that one
        came later than the other. The NO is not due to the dates being equal, but
        rather because one date is clearly later than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that "Ghost" was released
        later than "Wait a Minute!"
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (October 2015 vs March 2016) and explicitly states that one
        was released after the other. It does not claim the dates are equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        provides a clear comparative answer that Jamie-Lee's "Ghost" was NOT released
        earlier than Willow Smith's "Wait a Minute!"

        about the exact dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not reach a definitive conclusion.
        While it works through the logic and suggests that if "Baby Blue" was released
        in March 1972 and "Oh Girl" in April 1972 then "Baby Blue" would be earlier,
        it ultimately expresses uncertainty about these dates ("I need to cross-verify
