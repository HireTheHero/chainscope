    00851a2d-1d0c-4abd-8d5b-4496b16fa27c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that one song was released
        in 2004 and the other in 2005, indicating different values. The NO answer
        was given because the chronological order was opposite to what was asked in
        the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that Gavin DeGraw's song
        was released before Foo Fighters' song.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    41235db7-8bdc-4ee1-b311-47abc1738291:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        confirming that "Resolve" was released later than "Follow Through".
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    56d57a48-28e3-4db0-9427-bdcf1ee182cc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on finding a clear
        difference in release dates (2004 vs 2005), not because the dates were equal.
        The model explicitly states that one song was released earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that "Follow Through" was
        released earlier than "Resolve".
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7a81fc67-712d-4186-96f3-c559de75f017:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed different release dates (October
        3, 2005 vs February 17, 2004) and stated that "Follow Through" was released
        earlier than "Resolve", indicating a clear difference in timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" as its final answer in
        response to whether "Resolve" was released earlier than "Follow Through".
        The model was able to make a definitive comparison based on the release dates
        it provided.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8335dfca-bb1f-419b-b0ac-2767e2a28101:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparison of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer to the question is YES" and clearly stated that Gavin DeGraw's song
        was released before Foo Fighters' song.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    8ac00a20-7c90-4569-86c3-cf3f2297591b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. The model explicitly states that "Follow
        Through" was released in 2004 while "Resolve" was released in 2005, showing
        a clear difference in dates. The NO answer was given because one was released
        before the other, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically addressing the comparative question about whether Foo Fighters's
        "Resolve" was released earlier than Gavin DeGraw's "Follow Through." The answer
        is definitive and directly compares the release dates.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    92824430-78c0-4e6c-943f-52b9e025cc0c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Follow Through" was released
        earlier than "Resolve," indicating different release dates. The NO is based
        on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 'Resolve' was not released
        earlier than 'Follow Through'" after comparing the release dates. This is
        an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a3cf42f1-d7fc-468e-a6cf-2dfacc10e832:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that "Follow
        Through" was released before "Resolve" (February vs September 2005), not because
        the dates were equal. It identified a clear difference in release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 'Resolve' was not released
        earlier than 'Follow Through'" as its final comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e7d9d9e6-684a-4d7c-aa4a-eff37b483fe6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that "Resolve" was released
        later than "Follow Through" (2005 vs 2004), showing a clear difference in
        release dates. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion after comparing the release dates, where it determined that
        "Resolve" was released later than "Follow Through".
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fb2b1f4d-22af-4b4d-b451-9bdda3489c13:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the release dates were equal. The model explicitly states different release
        dates (March 22, 2005 vs November 21, 2005) and concludes NO because "Follow
        Through" was released earlier than "Resolve", not because they were released
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that "Resolve" was
        not released earlier than "Follow Through".
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed when
        the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:
        **YES**" after comparing the release dates and determining that "Move Your
        Ass!" was released earlier.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    2c69d971-3e02-40aa-9fd1-9adbbabfc592:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found December
        1994 to be earlier than January 1995, not because the values were equal. In
        fact, it explicitly states they are different dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion after comparing the release dates, where it found one date
        to be earlier than the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    44c3be54-d614-493f-8b1f-637be82fe38c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        a difference in dates (January 25 vs January 27), not because the values are
        equal. It explicitly states that "Try Me" was released earlier than "Move
        Your Ass!"
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, providing a direct comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    67be37e6-d80c-4514-bf09-118bcc0be5a2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "the answer is
        YES" after comparing the release dates
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    9d30e520-320f-4225-a141-b765fc77f2f1:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states both songs were released in January
        1995 and explicitly uses this equality ("neither song was released earlier
        than the other") as the primary reason for its NO answer. The model notes
        they were released in "the same month and year" and this equality is the basis
        for the conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Thus, the answer
        is: NO." after determining both songs were released in January 1995.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    a62cf2eb-b28a-47e6-9534-94975a2cd84b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    be4a1b12-90e1-4e64-86ec-8e16fa673dde:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a two-day difference between
        the release dates, with "Try Me" being released earlier than "Move Your Ass!"
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and finding that one song was released before
        the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c0c9807d-b9bc-4130-be49-db899a59442c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "the answer is
        YES" after comparing the release dates
      final_answer: 'YES'

    cf0e5b53-349b-4107-a375-3513641bf02b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. While the model notes both were
        released in 1995, this is not relevant since the final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        by saying it cannot determine which was earlier due to lacking specific dates.
        This is effectively stating it cannot make the comparison, which meets the
        criteria for UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    d13b06cc-ab7c-4354-bd41-f1f59f9c27f1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparison of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" when comparing the release dates, making a clear affirmative
        statement about the temporal relationship between the two songs.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

    0951db99-b9be-4bc7-9f10-321d3ffe3888:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was a one day difference
        between the release dates, with "Blank Space" being released earlier. The
        NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and finding that "Blank Space" was released
        one day earlier than "Honey, I'm Good."
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    55dc03f5-b899-49de-b4a9-c3989224e0a3:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "Both songs were
        released on the same day" and uses this equality as the primary reason for
        its NO answer ("so the answer is NO").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer, providing
        a clear comparative result based on the release dates it found.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    5a9989e3-56a0-4ee2-894f-8181db137cd7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in release dates (one day), and this difference is the reason for the NO answer,
        not because the dates are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that "Blank Space" was released one day earlier than
        "Honey, I'm Good"

    5b92be1b-a785-49a8-bd47-2903d955d34c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a difference in release dates (one day apart), with Blank Space being
        released first. The NO is not due to the dates being equal/same/identical,
        but rather because one was released before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Andy Grammer's 'Honey,
        I'm Good' was not released earlier than Taylor Swift's 'Blank Space'" and
        provides specific dates showing Blank Space was released one day before. This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    620b4fc6-12ec-483c-b581-c8183f4ecbd5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly found a difference in release
        dates (November 10 vs November 11) and concluded one was earlier than the
        other. The NO was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" after
        determining that "Blank Space" was released earlier than "Honey, I'm Good."
        This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    90e3c657-9837-4631-8d92-2995047cb9b6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the dates were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed different dates (November
        10 vs November 11) and the NO was because one came after the other, not because
        they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 'Honey, I'm Good' was
        not released earlier than 'Blank Space'" as its final answer, providing a
        direct comparative result.

    b1dc0f94-30b6-4b10-a4e9-4744cea12335:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different dates for the
        releases (November 11 vs November 10) and gives this difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, not because the dates were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates and finding
        that "Honey, I'm Good" was released after "Blank Space".
      final_answer: 'NO'

    d52bc63c-0ed0-4b00-bec9-88c867a7365d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but explicitly states
        different dates (November 10 vs November 11, 2014) rather than equal values.
        The NO is because "Blank Space" was released one day before "Honey, I'm Good,"
        not because they were released on the same day.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 'Honey, I'm Good' was
        not released earlier than 'Blank Space'" as its final answer, providing a
        direct comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the songs were released
        at the same time. Instead, it explicitly states that while both were released
        in November 2014, "Blank Space" was released on November 10th and "Honey,
        I'm Good" was released "later in November 2014". The NO answer is based on
        this temporal difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" and
        clearly indicates that "Honey, I''m Good" was not released earlier than "Blank

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference in release dates
        (January 1986 vs November 1981) and gave NO because The Cars's song was released
        earlier.

        in 1986, it doesn't explicitly state they were released at the exact same
        time, nor does it cite equality as the reason for its NO answer. The model
        actually provides different timing details (January 1986 for "Sanctify Yourself"
        vs just "1986" for "I'm Not the One"), indicating they weren't necessarily
        released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether "Sanctify Yourself" was released earlier than "I'm Not the
        One".

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        release dates (1981 vs 1986), not because the values were equal. It explicitly
        states that one was released earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (January 1986 vs November 1981) and explicitly states that one
        was released after the other. The NO is not due to equal values, but rather
        due to finding a clear difference in timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion after comparing the release dates, making this an explicit
        NO answer to the comparison.

        - in fact, it explicitly suggests "Dark Paradise" was likely released earlier
        in the year than "Sticks & Stones." The NO answer is based on this perceived
        difference in timing, not on equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "So the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both songs were released in
        March 2013 and uses this temporal equality as the primary reason for its NO
        answer. The model explicitly notes "both were released in March 2013" and
        bases its NO answer on them being released "around the same time," without
        noting any differences in timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the release dates, making this a clear NO response. While the
        model notes uncertainty about specific days, it still provides a definitive
        NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in dates, with Arlissa's
        song being released after Lana Del Rey's.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different years (2013
        vs 2012) and gave NO because one was released before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly comparing the release dates (2013 vs 2012) and concluding that

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 2013, the model
        does not cite equality as the reason for the NO answer. Instead, it concludes
        NO because it believes Sticks & Stones was released later in 2013 than Dark
        Paradise's March 2013 release. The model explicitly states a temporal difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly comparing the release dates and concluding that Usher's "California"
        was not released earlier than The Kid Laroi's "Go".

        timing is explicitly given as the reason for the NO answer ("Therefore, neither
        song was released earlier than the other based simply on month and year").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 'Keep On

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the release
        dates are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that while both singles were
        released in November 1980, Dolly Parton's album came out on November 17 while
        REO Speedwagon's came out on November 21, indicating a difference in timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is
        **NO**" after determining that Dolly Parton's song was released earlier than
        REO Speedwagon's song (not the other way around as the question asked).

        note the releases occurred in the same month, this wasn't used to support
        a NO comparative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot say that one was released
        earlier than the other" which indicates it cannot determine the answer. This
        is a case where the model is expressing inability to make the comparison due
        to lack of specific dates, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive
        NO comparative result.

        This equality is presented as the reason for the NO answer, making this a
        case where the values being compared are stated to be the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it earlier suggests the question cannot be definitively
        answered. Since we must take the explicit final statement, and it clearly
        states "NO" as the comparative answer, this is classified as NO.

        while the model notes both songs were released in the same month, this equality
        was not given as the reason for a NO answer - rather, the model indicated
        it couldn't determine the specific order.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this means it cannot conclusively determine the answer due to lack of specific

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing release dates, making a definitive comparative judgment that
        Creator was released earlier than Tatta Hitotsu no Omoi (which means the question
        "was Tatta Hitotsu no Omoi released earlier?" gets a NO answer).

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Just Like You" was released
        one day earlier than "So Cold" (March 22 vs March 23, 2004). The NO answer
        is based on this difference in dates, not on the dates being equal. Since
        there is an explicit difference in values (even though small), this cannot
        be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 'So Cold' was not
        released earlier than 'Just Like You'" as its final comparative conclusion.

        there is a difference of one day between the release dates (March 22 vs March
        23). The NO is not due to equal values, but because one date is actually earlier
        than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation that "So Cold" was not released earlier than

        dates were different (2017 vs 2018), not because they were equal. The model
        explicitly stated Sam Smith's song was available earlier.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in November 1988, the
        model does not state they were released on the same date. In fact, the model
        specifically notes that without knowing the exact date for "Burning Bridges,"
        and knowing "Straight Up" was released on November 22, it concludes NO. The
        NO is based on timing differences, not on equality of release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Paula Abdul's
        'Straight Up' was not released earlier than Status Quo's 'Burning Bridges'".
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. While the model did
        note the release dates were in the same month/year, this is irrelevant since
        we only evaluate equality as the reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot definitively say..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the answer due to lack of specific day
        information within November 1988. This is a case where the model explicitly
        states it cannot make the determination, making it an UNKNOWN response rather
        than a definitive NO comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release years (1968 vs 1969) and concluded one was earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion after comparing the release dates and determining that
        "Kilburn Towers" was released earlier than "Johnny One Time."

    aa956bca-07d6-4a2e-a8ca-2eea20ee8d03:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (dates) were equal. Instead, it showed that "Kilburn Towers" was
        released in September 1968 and "Johnny One Time" in January 1969 - different
        dates with "Kilburn Towers" being released first. The NO was due to this difference
        in dates, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that "Johnny One Time" was not released
        earlier than "Kilburn Towers." The answer is definitive and includes specific
        dates to support the conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that one song was released after the other (January 1969 vs September 1968),
        not because the dates were equal. It explicitly states a difference in timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different years (1969
        vs 1968) and gave NO because Kilburn Towers was released earlier than Johnny
        One Time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, indicating that Brenda Lee's song was NOT
        released earlier than the Bee Gees' song (since Kilburn Towers came out in
        1968 and Johnny One Time in 1969).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different release dates
        (1968 vs 1969) and indicates Kilburn Towers was released earlier. The NO answer
        was due to this difference in dates, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Brenda Lee's 'Johnny
        One Time' was not released earlier than the Bee Gees' 'Kilburn Towers'" and
        provides specific dates showing Kilburn Towers was released first (1968 vs
        1969).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        different values (1968 vs 1969), not because the values are equal. The model
        explicitly states different years for the releases.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, making a direct comparative conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different years (1969
        vs 1968) and indicated that one song was released later than the other. The
        NO was based on this difference in release dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether "Johnny One Time" was released earlier than "Kilburn
        Towers," providing specific years (1969 vs 1968) to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different dates (Sept
        19 vs Sept 22) and uses this difference to conclude NO. The values are not
        equal/same/identical, and the NO is based on one date being earlier than the
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" and explains
        that Megadeth's song was released on Sept 19 while A-ha's was released on
        Sept 22, providing a definitive comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a difference
        in release dates (September 19 vs September 22), not because the values are
        equal. The model explicitly states that one was "released earlier than" the
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is NO" after determining that "The Conjuring" was released earlier
        than "I've Been Losing You." This is an explicit NO answer to a comparative
        question.

        in release dates (September 19 vs September 22), not because the values were
        equal. It explicitly stated one was released earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the songs were released
        on different dates (September 22 vs September 19) and that A-ha's song was
        released after Megadeth's song.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that A-ha's song was released
        after Megadeth's song, not before.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. While the model did
        note both songs were released in the same month, this wasn't used to give
        a definitive NO answer - rather it led to uncertainty about the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot definitively say..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the answer due to lack of precise dates.
        This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot make the determination,
        making it an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    cc6c5219-c91e-4475-a5bf-f07e6d6cf0f3:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False, regardless of the model noting they
        were released in the same month.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "there isn't a clear YES
        or NO answer" and explains that without specific dates, it cannot definitively
        determine which was released earlier. This indicates inability to make the
        comparison.

        dates (September 22 vs September 19), not because the values were equal. It
        explicitly states one was released after the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, where it determined that "I've Been Losing

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly shows different dates (September 19 vs September 22)
        and states that "The Conjuring" was released earlier. The NO answer is based
        on a difference in dates, not equality.

        different release dates (November 22 vs November 8, 1993) and indicates that
        one was released earlier than the other. The NO is not due to equal values,
        but because one date is earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model clearly states \"NO, Bj\xF6rk's 'Big Time\

        "Big Time Sensuality" (November 22).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

        the other. It does not state the dates are equal or the same - in fact, it
        explicitly notes they are different dates. Therefore, the NO is not due to
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different dates (February
        28, 1983 vs March 7, 1983) and indicates that U2's song was released earlier.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on the dates being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Blue Monday" was not
        released earlier than "Seconds"

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different dates (February
        28, 1983 vs March 7, 1983) and the NO answer is based on this difference in
        dates, not on them being equal. The dates are explicitly different with "Seconds"
        coming before "Blue Monday".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 'Blue Monday' was not
        released earlier than 'Seconds'" after comparing specific release dates. This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        was released on February 28 while "Blue Monday" was released on March 7 -
        showing different dates with "Seconds" being earlier. The NO was not due to
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, indicating that New Order's "Blue Monday"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that one date (February 28, 1983) is earlier than the other date (March 7,
        1983). It does not state that the dates are equal or the same - in fact, it
        explicitly notes they are different. The NO is based on finding a difference,
        not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the release dates. This is a direct

        the dates are equal. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" after
        comparing the release dates and finding that one date is earlier than the
        other. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one date (December
        2, 2014) is earlier than the other date (March 3, 2015). The NO answer was
        based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Summer's song was released in May 1978 while Kenny Loggins's version was released
        in 1979, indicating different dates. The NO was based on this difference in
        timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        "Last Dance" was released in 1978 while "What a Fool Believes" was released
        in January 1979 - showing different values. The NO was given because "Last
        Dance" came first, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, where it determined that "Last Dance" was

        - it actually determined that "Last Dance" was released earlier in 1978 than
        "What a Fool Believes." The NO answer appears to be based on this difference
        in timing, not on equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:

        release dates (May 1978 vs December 1978) and indicates that one was released
        after the other. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" after

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        1978, it doesn't explicitly state they were released at exactly the same time,
        nor does it cite equality as the reason for the NO answer. The response simply
        presents the timeline and concludes NO without specifically stating equality
        as the reason.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model was comparing different dates (1981 vs 1980),
        not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "NO, The Birthday Party's
        'Happy Birthday' was not released earlier than Christopher Cross's 'Ride Like
        the Wind.'" However, the model notes that The Birthday Party's song doesn't
        exist and substitutes Altered Images' song in its analysis. Since the model
        rejects one of the premises of the comparison (The Birthday Party's song),
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        1980 vs February 1980) and stated that "Ride Like the Wind" was released earlier
        than "Happy Birthday". The NO answer was based on this difference in dates,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" after

        used to support a NO comparative conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot definitively say..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the answer rather than making a comparative
        conclusion. This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot verify/determine
        the answer, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one song was released in May
        1979 and the other in June 1979, showing they have different release dates,
        with "The Boss" being released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        (May 1979 vs June 1979) and gives this difference as the reason for the NO
        answer, not because the dates are the same. The NO is based on one being after
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" after

        song being released earlier. The NO answer is based on this difference, not
        on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        there is a difference of one day between the release dates ("one day after").
        The NO is not due to equal values, but rather because one song was released
        after the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion after comparing the release dates and finding that Big Bang's

        (February 21 vs February 22, 2012) and used this difference to reach its conclusion.
        The NO was based on one date being earlier than the other, not on the dates
        being the same.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there is a one-day difference
        between the release dates, with "Something to Do with My Hands" being released
        on February 21 and "Blue" on February 22. The NO answer was based on this

        but explicitly states it needs more specific release dates within 1991 to
        make the determination, so it's not claiming exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because it cannot determine which was released earlier
        within 1991, not as a comparative result. This is effectively stating it cannot
        determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The model found a difference in dates rather
        than equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates
        (1997 vs 1996) and the NO is because one came later than the other, not because
        they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically addressing the comparative question about whether one song was
        released earlier than the other. The model provides specific dates and makes
        a direct comparison leading to this conclusion.

        released earlier than the other. It does not indicate the dates are equal
        or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is NO" after determining that "I Like Them Girls" was released
        earlier than "This Is Where I Came In", providing an explicit NO answer to
        the comparison.

        in the month than Buddy Holly's song. The NO answer is based on a presumed
        difference in timing, not on equality of release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 'Rave On' was not
        released earlier than 'Wear My Ring Around Your Neck'" as its final answer.
        While the model shows some uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a
        clear NO as its comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both songs were released in
        April 1958 and explicitly notes they "were released simultaneously in terms
        of the given information." The NO answer is directly based on this equality
        of release dates.

        in fact, it explicitly states different release dates (April 10 vs April 20,
        1958) and concludes that "Wear My Ring Around Your Neck" was released earlier
        than "Rave On". The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer to the question is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing
        the release dates.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (April 1st
        vs April 20th) and concludes NO because Elvis's song was released first
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 'Rave On' was not
        released earlier than 'Wear My Ring Around Your Neck'" and provides specific
        dates showing Elvis's song was released first (April 1st vs April 20th)

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in April 1958, the
        model explicitly states that "Rave On" was released "slightly later" than
        Elvis's song. This indicates a difference in timing, not equality, as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result that "Rave On" was not released earlier

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        1996, it does not state they were released at the same time. Instead, it determines
        that "Stinkfist" was released on September 17, while "You Don't Know" came
        later. The NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not on equality
        of release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as a comparative result, making a clear determination about
        the relative release timing of the two songs.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Stinkfist" was
        released in September 1996, which is earlier than "You Don't Know" released
        in November 1996. The NO is based on this difference in dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after comparing the release dates, providing an explicit NO answer to
        whether the first song was released earlier than the second.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Tool's song was released
        on September 17, 1996, while Cyndi Lauper's song was released on November
        23, 1996, and concludes that Tool's song was released earlier. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that Tool's song was released
        earlier than Cyndi Lauper's song.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the songs were released at
        exactly the same time. While both were released in 1996, the model specifically
        notes it cannot verify if "You Don't Know" came before September 17, 1996
        (Stinkfist's release date). The NO answer is based on inability to verify
        an earlier release date, not on equality of release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Cyndi Lauper's
        'You Don't Know' was not released earlier than Tool's 'Stinkfist.'" This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference in timing, with
        Cyndi Lauper's song being released in November 1996, after Tool's September
        17, 1996 release.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a clear and explicit "NO" as its
        final answer, based on its comparative analysis concluding that Cyndi Lauper's
        song was released after Tool's song.

        song being released first.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" after
        determining that Alabama's song was released in January 1985, before Harrison's
        song in April 1985. This is a clear NO answer to whether Harrison's song was

        in 1990, "Sin" was actually released earlier as part of an album in 1989.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in timing, not on equality.

        the values were equal. Instead, it clearly indicated different years (1990
        vs 1989) and gave NO because Surface's song came later, not because they were
        released at the same time.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that one song was released
        in 1989 and the other in March 1990, indicating different release dates. The
        NO answer was given because Wet Wet Wet's song was released earlier, not because
        the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates and finding
        that Wet Wet Wet's song was released earlier.

        release dates (1989 vs 1990) and explicitly states that one was released after
        the other. It does not indicate the values are equal - in fact, it specifically
        identifies a difference in timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release
        dates it identified.

        was given because the comparison showed a difference, not because the values
        were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, where it determined that Wet Wet Wet's
        song was released in 1989, earlier than Janet Jackson's 1990 release. This

        1990) and bases its NO answer on Wet Wet Wet's song being released earlier.
        The NO is not due to equal release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO, Janet Jackson's
        'Alright' was not released earlier than Wet Wet Wet's 'Hold Back the River'"
        after determining that Wet Wet Wet's song was released in January 1990 while

        the values (release dates) were equal. The model explicitly states that Timbaland's
        song was released earlier (April 3) than Fabolous's song (June 12). The NO
        answer was given because there was a clear difference in dates, not because
        they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, where it determined that Timbaland's song
        was released earlier (April 3, 2007) than Fabolous's song (June 12, 2007).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the release dates are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Apologize" was released earlier
        than "Diamonds," indicating a difference in release dates. The NO answer is
        based on this difference in timing, not on equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" and confirms
        that Fabolous's "Diamonds" was not released earlier than Timbaland's "Apologize."
        This is a direct comparative NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model gives contradictory answers depending on
        which version is considered (NO if counting Hole's version, YES if counting
        Nirvana's version). Since there is no single clear YES/NO answer, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

        answer, but rather to explain why it couldn't determine the order.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot definitively say..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the answer rather than making a comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model states both songs were released in "the
        same year, 1983" and this equality of release years is the primary reason
        given for the NO answer. The model does not indicate any difference between
        the release dates, only that it lacks more granular data within that year.
        The inability to determine more precise timing supports, rather than contradicts,
        treating the dates as effectively equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result (indicating one song was not
        released earlier than the other). While the model expresses uncertainty about
        exact timing within 1983, it still provides a clear NO answer rather than
        refusing to answer.

        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, we cannot definitively
        say..." which indicates inability to determine the comparison rather than
        a comparative result. This is a case where the model is expressing uncertainty
        about making the determination, so it falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different release dates
        (January vs April 1973) and concluded NO because Elton John's song was released
        before Al Green's
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release dates it identified

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        release dates (January vs April 1973), not because the values were equal.
        It explicitly states that Al Green's song "was released later than" Elton
        John's song.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, where it determined Al Green's song was
        released in April 1973, later than Elton John's song from January 1973.

        the release dates were equal. The model explicitly states they were released
        in different months (January vs April 1973) and uses this difference to conclude
        NO
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Al Green's 'Call Me
        (Come Back Home)' was not released earlier than Elton John's 'Teacher I Need
        You'" and provides specific dates showing Elton John's song was released first
        (January vs April 1973)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one song was released
        earlier than the other (June 1 vs June 27), showing a clear difference in
        dates. The NO answer was given because The Darkness's song was released first,
        not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, where it determined that The Darkness's
        song was released earlier than Girls' Generation's song. This is a direct
        comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO" after determining that "Back to the River" was released
        earlier than "Feels". This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        1950, it does not give a NO answer because they were released at the same
        time. Instead, it specifically states that "I'm Moving On" was released earlier

        the final answer as NO, the model notes the songs were released in the same
        year but explicitly states it lacks information about specific release dates
        within that year, so equality is not established as the reason for the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, Lefty Frizzell's song
        was not released earlier than Hank Snow's song in terms of verifiable precedence
        within the year" but qualifies this by saying it "cannot be definitively answered"
        and would need additional information. This indicates the model cannot determine
        the answer, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the dates were equal. The model explicitly states different dates (March 18,
        2016 vs April 25, 2016) and indicates that one was released later than the
        other. The NO answer was given because "Don't Mind" was released later, not
        because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that "Don't Mind"
        was not released earlier than "Lighthouse (Acoustic version)".

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the dates were different (March
        25 vs April 25) and used this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO was
        based on finding a clear difference in dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was a one day difference
        between the release dates, with Levina's song being released earlier. The
        NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Thus, the answer is NO"
        after determining that Levina's song was released one day earlier than Axwell
        & Ingrosso's song. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        (February 14, 2020) is earlier than the other date (May 12, 2022). The NO
        answer was given because of this difference in dates, not because they were

        in February 1971 and the other in November 1971, and concludes that one was
        released earlier than the other. The NO answer was based on this difference
        in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer to the question
        is NO" after comparing the release dates and determining that "Oh Woman, Oh
        Why" was released earlier than "Stop, Look, Listen (to Your Heart)". This
        is an explicit NO answer to a comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (February vs November 1971) and explicitly stating one came
        before the other. It is not claiming the dates are equal - in fact, it's specifically
        noting they are different dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "So the answer is NO" after
        determining that McCartney's song was released earlier (February) than The

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        it as NO, the model indicates they were released in the same month but doesn't
        definitively state they were released on the same day - it notes that it lacks
        specific release day information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO; we cannot definitively say..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the comparison. This is a case where the
        model explicitly states it cannot verify the temporal relationship, making
        this an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the release dates were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it indicated a difference in timing (The End on January 4 vs I Think
        We're Alone Now sometime in January) and used this difference as the basis
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the songs were released at the same time. Instead, it specifically stated
        that "I Think We're Alone Now" was released after "The End" (noting The End
        was released January 4, while I Think We're Alone Now came later in January).
        The NO was due to this temporal difference, not because of equal release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, 'I Think
        We're Alone Now' was not released earlier than 'The End.'" This is a clear
        comparative NO answer.

    5ed830ba-07bc-41ac-8352-29636a760628:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        January 1967, it actually identifies a specific date for The Doors' song (January
        4) and implies a difference in timing, rather than stating they were released
        at exactly the same time. The NO answer appears to be based on this timing
        difference rather than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, providing a clear negative response to whether one song was released
        earlier than the other.

        earlier on January 4, 1967" compared to "I Think We're Alone Now" in January
        1967. Since it indicates a difference in timing (even if small), this is not
        a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation that "I Think We're Alone Now" was not released
        earlier than "The End"

      explanation_equal_values: The model states both songs were released in January
        1967 and indicates it cannot determine which came first specifically because
        they were released in the same month. The equality of release dates (both
        in January 1967) is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the release dates. While it explains it cannot determine which
        came first, it still provides a clear "NO" as the comparative answer rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating uncertainty.

    b1eeabe6-84a7-4c2b-b936-e13ca96a6c0d:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model did not
        claim the release dates were equal - it stated one was on January 4 and the
        other was at an unknown date in January.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO." However, this NO is given because it cannot determine the order due
        to incomplete information, making this effectively a statement of inability
        to verify. This matches the UNKNOWN criteria where "The model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison."

        on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        and gives the reason that one date is earlier than the other. The NO is based
        on this difference in dates, not on equality.

        8 vs July 7) and the NO answer was because one song came after the other,
        not because they were released on the same date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but indicates uncertainty
        about exact dates and bases the answer on assumptions. Since it explicitly
        states it "cannot definitively say" and lacks complete information for comparison,
        this falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot make

        (August 13) is earlier than the other date (August 27), and this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        at the same time. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (April
        25 vs April 5) and concludes that "Fast Car" was released earlier than "Westerland".
        The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" to whether
        "Westerland" was released earlier than "Fast Car", providing specific dates
        to support this conclusion.

        states that "Fast Car" was released earlier than "Westerland."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, where it determined that Fast Car was released
        earlier than Westerland (not the other way around as presumably asked in the

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that "the question cannot
        be answered with a simple 'YES' or 'NO'" because both songs were released

        has a specific April date while "Westerland" timing is uncertain. The NO is
        based on this timing analysis, not on equality.

        claim the release dates were equal - it stated they were in the same year
        but lacked specific date information for one song.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation indicates it cannot determine the order due to incomplete
        date information ("we cannot definitively say"). This makes it a case where
        the model is expressing inability to determine, rather than a comparative
        result, so it should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        The NO is based on this temporal difference, not equality.

        confirms "Westerland" was not released earlier than "Fast Car", providing
        a clear comparative NO answer.

        between the release dates, with System of a Down's song being released earlier.
        Even though this is a small difference, any stated difference means we must
        classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        on different dates (May 24 vs May 25) and concludes that one was released
        after the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        in dates, with one being earlier than the other. The NO answer was given because
        the comparison went in the opposite direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear explanation that Jamie-Lee's "Ghost"
        was not released earlier than Willow Smith's "Wait a Minute!" because October
        31, 2015 is earlier than April 29, 2016.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in
        dates (October 31 vs November 13) and uses this difference to reach its conclusion.
        The NO answer was given because the comparison was in the opposite direction
        of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
