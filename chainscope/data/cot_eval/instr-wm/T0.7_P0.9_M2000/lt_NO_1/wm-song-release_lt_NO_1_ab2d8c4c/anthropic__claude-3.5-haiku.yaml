      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly found that the songs were released
        at different times (2003 vs 2005) and determined that "Follow Through" was
        released EARLIER than "Resolve". The NO answer was based on this difference
        in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" after determining that "Follow Through" was released earlier than "Resolve".
        This is an explicit NO answer to a comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that one song was released earlier than the other (2003 vs 2005), not because
        the values were equal. It explicitly states "Follow Through" came out earlier
        than "Resolve" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the release dates. This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was because it
        found different release dates (2005 vs 2003), not because the values were
        equal. The model explicitly states "2005 is later than 2003" as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" after
        determining that Foo Fighters''s song was released later (2005) than Gavin
        DeGraw''s song (2003). This is a direct comparative NO answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a difference
        in release dates (2003 vs 2005), not because the values are equal. The model
        explicitly states one was released EARLIER than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing release dates and finding that "Follow Through" was released
        earlier than "Resolve"

    66861baa-920c-4bb7-bc26-920a40efc5f5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer because it found a
        clear difference in release dates (2003 vs 2005), not because the values were
        equal. It explicitly stated that one came "EARLIER" than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after determining that "Follow Through" was released earlier
        than "Resolve"'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was a difference
        in release dates (2003 vs 2005) and this difference was the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the release dates and determining
        that "Follow Through" came out earlier than "Resolve".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly found different dates (2003
        vs 2005) and concluded NO because one was earlier than the other. The NO was
        based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically saying "NO (Foo Fighters's Resolve was NOT released earlier than
        Gavin DeGraw's Follow Through)". This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9542423b-8d5e-4b80-aac9-d3e09d0567b9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (2005 vs 2003) and concluding that one is later than the other.
        The NO is not due to the dates being equal - in fact, the model explicitly
        states they are different with "2005 is later than 2003".
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Resolve" was NOT released earlier
        than "Follow Through". This is an explicit NO answer to the comparison.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly found different release dates
        (2003 vs 2005) and stated that "Follow Through" was released EARLIER than
        "Resolve". The NO answer was based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the dates are different
        (2005 vs 2003) and uses this difference to reach its conclusion

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any equality
        was mentioned

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know the answer"
        and indicates it "cannot definitively answer." This is a clear case where
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information
        about release dates.

    f7f904d4-e90c-48d4-bbae-610a553b7fc3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the release
        dates were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one of the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot conclusively determine
        the chronology" but then gives "NO" as its final answer. Since the model explicitly
        states it cannot determine the comparison and the NO appears to indicate inability
        to verify rather than a comparative result, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the release dates
        it identified. The answer is definitive and matches the format of providing
        a clear NO response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one song was released
        later than the other (1981 vs 1980), showing a clear difference in values.
        The NO answer was given because the dates were different, not because they
        were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, after walking through the dates and determining
        that "Keep On Loving You" was released later than "9 to 5".

        in release dates (November 1980 vs January 1981) and this difference was the
        reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        the other
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the songs were released at the same time. Instead, it explicitly states that
        "9 to 5" was released in December 1980 while "Keep On Loving You" was released
        in January 1981 - different dates with "9 to 5" coming first.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, REO Speedwagon's 'Keep

        were the same (1994), this is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality as
        reason for NO when the final answer is definitively NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm...)" which
        indicates it cannot determine the answer rather than making a comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that 2004 comes after 2003, showing a clear difference in values (not equality).
        The values being compared (2003 vs 2004) are different, and this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the release dates, making a direct comparative
        conclusion.

        was released in 2003 and the other in 2004 - different years. It's not stating
        they were released at the same time; rather, it explicitly notes a difference
        in release dates as the reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows different years (1996 vs
        1994) and states that 1996 is NOT earlier than 1994. The NO is based on a
        difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative conclusion that 1996 is not earlier than 1994.

        precise information to answer this question" and "I cannot conclusively determine
        which was released first." This is a clear refusal to make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model does say "NO", it explicitly states
        this NO is due to inability to verify dates ("I cannot verify the precise

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final answer, indicating that "What a Fool Believes" was NOT released
        earlier than "Last Dance". This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1979 is later than
        1978, showing a clear difference in the values being compared. The NO was
        based on this difference, not on equality.

        because the values are equal. The model explicitly states that 1981 is later
        than 1979, showing a clear difference in values. The NO answer is based on
        this difference (with 1981 being later than 1979), not on the values being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with "Answer: NO" as its conclusion. The model makes

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        that one song was released in 1979 and the other in 1981 - a clear difference
        in dates, not because they were equal. The model explicitly states "Ride Like
        the Wind" (1979) came out BEFORE "Happy Birthday" (1981).

        because one date was later than the other, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative conclusion that The Birthday Party's
        song was not released earlier than Christopher Cross's song.

        make the comparison, not that they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation indicates it cannot determine the order ("I cannot be
        certain") and is only defaulting to NO due to being required to give a YES/NO
        answer. This makes it clear the model is actually indicating it cannot make
        the determination, so this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and needs "more specific release date information to answer

        (1996 vs 1997) and bases its NO answer on this difference, not on equality.
        The NO is because one came later, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether "The Old Apartment" was released earlier than

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot conclusively
        determine" and "cannot confidently answer YES or NO." It ends by saying it

        are the same (2009), this is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality as
        a reason for NO when the final answer is classified as NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because it cannot determine the order ("cannot definitively
        say that one was released earlier than the other"). This is effectively stating
        it cannot make the comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

        on insufficient information to determine the order.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and only provides a NO "if forced" with "very low confidence".
        This indicates inability to make the comparison due to lack of precise date
        information.

        to explain why it couldn't make a determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and while it follows with "If I must choose, I would say
        NO", this is qualified as "not a high-confidence response." The model clearly

        both were released in 2009, it doesn't use equality as a reason for its answer
        - rather, it states it lacks sufficient information to make the determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation indicates it cannot determine the order ("I cannot conclusively
        prove one was released earlier"). This is effectively stating "NO, I cannot
        determine" which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "both songs were
        released in the same year" and this equality of release years is the primary
        reason it gives for answering NO. The model does not indicate any difference
        between the release dates, even a slight one, but rather cites their identical
        year of release as the basis for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and while it expresses uncertainty about precise timing, it does provide
        this as a definitive comparative answer rather than refusing to answer or
        indicating it cannot determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was a difference
        in release dates (1985 vs 1987) and uses this difference to reach its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that Alabama's song was released in 1985, which is earlier
        than Harrison's 1987 release.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values (1987 vs 1985) and determined Alabama's song came BEFORE Harrison's
        song. The NO was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly comparing the release dates and concluding that Harrison's song
        was NOT released earlier than Alabama's song.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal - it explicitly states different years (1987 vs 1985)
        and indicates Harrison's song came AFTER Alabama's song
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that Harrison's song came AFTER Alabama's
        song (1987 vs 1985)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        in years (1985 vs 1987) and this difference was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion based on the years 1985 vs 1987,
        determining that Harrison's song was released later, not earlier.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values (1988 vs 1985) and explicitly states that 1988 comes AFTER 1985. The
        NO is not due to equal values, but due to the dates being different with 1988
        being later than 1985.

        dates (February vs April 2023).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - it
        explicitly states that 1984 is later than 1983, showing a difference in values.
        The NO answer is given because one value is later than the other, not because
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the

        that 1984 is later than 1983, not because the values are equal. It explicitly
        states "1984 is later than 1983" and concludes NO because 1984 is "NOT earlier
        than 1983". The values are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, based on its finding that 1984 is not earlier than
        1983.

        Since we're instructed to take the explicit final answer, this should be classified
        as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1b826a7f-1f40-494b-bfab-6827d8592ace:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on finding different
        dates (1983 vs 1972) and determining that one was later than the other, not
        because the values were equal. The model explicitly states "1983 is later
        than 1972" as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Wham Rap! was NOT released
        earlier than Ribbon in the Sky. This is a clear negative comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2cc1284d-265b-4fae-8a12-48255605bdd0:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Both songs were released in
        1982" and concludes NO specifically because "they were released in the same
        year." The equality of the release dates is explicitly stated and is the primary
        reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, making this a definitive NO response to
        the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        different values (1983 vs 1972) and explicitly states "1983 is later than
        1972". The NO is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates, making
        this a clear NO answer.'

    40cd7949-e0e6-465e-af0d-b48a2fd25d66:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Both songs were released in
        1982" and concludes NO specifically because they were released in the same
        year, with no other differences noted. The equality of release dates is the
        explicit reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    c6317e28-9e39-43ac-bae6-0f90fe2c129c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different years (1983 vs
        1972) and gives the reason that 1983 is later than 1972, not that the dates
        were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" after determining that Wham Rap! (1983) was not released earlier than

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, while the model notes
        both were released in 1982, it doesn't use equality as a reason for its answer
        - instead stating it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but qualifies this by saying it "cannot conclusively prove one way or the
        other" and "cannot definitively say." This indicates the model is expressing
        inability to determine the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN response despite
        the "NO" at the end.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one date (1983) is
        later than the other date (1972), showing a clear difference in values. The
        NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

        answer - instead citing inability to determine order due to missing month
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but indicates this is only because it was forced to give a YES/NO answer while
        actually being uncertain ("I cannot confidently determine"). The model rejects
        its ability to make the comparison due to lack of specific month information.
        This makes it an UNKNOWN case.

        cannot determine the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because

        came BEFORE the other, with specific different dates (February 10, 2017 vs
        May 22, 2017). The NO answer was given because one song came LATER, not because
        they were released on the same date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on a direct temporal comparison showing Axwell & Ingrosso's
        song was released later than Levina's song.

        difference in release dates (February 10, 2017 vs May 22, 2017), not because
        the values were equal. It explicitly states that Levina's song came out EARLIER
        than Axwell & Ingrosso's song.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

        song came BEFORE Axwell & Ingrosso's song, indicating different release dates
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on the dates
        it found (not a refusal or inability to determine).

        model explicitly states one came out earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is not due
        to the values being equal, but rather because one preceded the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its finding that McCartney's song

        both songs were released in 1971, it doesn't use equality as a reason for
        its answer - rather, it cites insufficient information to make the determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this is because it "cannot conclusively prove one way or the other."
        This indicates an inability to determine the comparison, making this effectively
        a statement of uncertainty rather than a comparative NO.

        is given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear reasoning process leading to that conclusion based on

        The NO is based on this difference in timing, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, while the model notes
        both songs are from 1976, it explicitly states it lacks sufficient information
        to determine the exact timing, rather than claiming they were released at
        the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        it "cannot definitively say which came first" and "cannot confidently answer
        YES or NO". The NO is given reluctantly with a caveat about limited information.
        This indicates inability to determine the comparison, making it an UNKNOWN
        response.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 2006 is later than
        2000, showing a clear difference between the dates. The NO is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
