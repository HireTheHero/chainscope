      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different dates (November 17, 2004
        vs November 17, 2005) and indicates that one was released before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support its comparison showing that
        Gavin DeGraw's song was released before Foo Fighters' song.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    58f2c545-98e0-4360-9393-ab1623c736c5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one date
        (November 8) is before the other date (November 21), and this difference in
        dates is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Foo Fighters's "Resolve" was released earlier than
        Gavin DeGraw's "Follow Through". The model provides specific dates and makes
        a direct comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    624c8149-1bd6-4603-b0a4-15ea6d79e9c0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states that one date (Nov 17, 2004) is before the other
        date (Nov 17, 2005). The NO is because the comparison goes in the opposite
        direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release dates it identified
        (Nov 17, 2005 vs Nov 17, 2004)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    63dfc4ae-0ea4-4134-8400-75cbb335e9d9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        2005, it explicitly states different release dates (November 15 vs November
        21) and bases its NO answer on the fact that DeGraw's song was released before
        Foo Fighters', not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Foo Fighters's "Resolve" was released earlier than
        Gavin DeGraw's "Follow Through". The model provides specific dates and makes
        a direct comparison showing Gavin DeGraw's song was released first.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6e0b8cd1-179c-4138-ac6e-7c69a61edfa1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        songs were released in different years (2005 vs 2004), not because the values
        were equal. It explicitly states that "Follow Through" was released earlier
        than "Resolve".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Foo Fighters's "Resolve" was released earlier than
        Gavin DeGraw's "Follow Through", providing specific dates to support this
        conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    74547093-3e80-4ed2-b79a-fcc1bfcc36d7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any value comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        with clear formatting in bold. It provided specific dates and made a definitive
        comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    7b76a85d-57ee-4067-a8b6-1fe168e92030:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states different years (2005 vs 2004) and
        gives the reason that 2004 is before 2005, indicating a clear difference in
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer to whether the Foo
        Fighters song was released earlier than the Gavin DeGraw song.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    82138dcf-1a39-482e-82f3-6e4cbd43f249:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one date (Nov 17,
        2004) was before the other date (Nov 16, 2005), indicating a clear difference
        in values
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release dates it identified
        (Nov 2005 vs Nov 2004)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9715045d-3772-4dc4-b03b-5f998feeea51:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the songs were released in
        different years (2005 vs 2003) and says "NO" because Gavin DeGraw's song came
        first. The values being compared (release dates) are different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Foo Fighters' "Resolve" was released earlier than
        Gavin DeGraw's "Follow Through". The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bee3a60b-c991-49bb-9ed2-1e1d0a679590:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states they are different dates (November 17, 2004
        vs November 17, 2005) and uses this difference to justify its NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative reasoning based on release dates (November 17, 2004
        vs November 17, 2005)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states different dates (January 22 vs January
        21, 1995) and concludes that "Try Me" was released before "Move Your Ass!"
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that "Try Me" was released before "Move
        Your Ass!"
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any equality
        was mentioned
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer...
        is: YES" after comparing the release dates and determining that Scooter''s
        song was released earlier'

    3c75fd69-5c74-40d3-823e-d2025a837280:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states different years (1995 vs 1994) and
        gives the reason that 1994 is before 1995, indicating a difference in values
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing specific dates to support
        its conclusion that Scooter's song was not released earlier than Super Monkey's
        song.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    730c427b-ee39-4717-9c92-27b01c45d267:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer...

    82018349-bad9-42b4-a104-ea59f539a63e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of the
        fact that the model noted both songs were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "We need more information about
        the specific release dates" and explicitly states it "can't determine which
        one was released earlier without more information." This indicates inability
        to make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether the values
        were equal (which they weren't in this case anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer... is: YES" after determining that "Move Your Ass!" was released on
        January 22, 1995, earlier than "Try Me" which was released on September 27,
        1995.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different years (1994
        vs 1995) and gave NO because Super Monkey's song was released earlier than
        Scooter's song.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing specific dates to support
        its conclusion that Scooter's song was released later (1995) than Super Monkey's
        song (1994).

    c6d04c91-56c3-484d-b3a2-9cde52a634a5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" in bold
        at the end of its response after comparing the release dates and determining
        that Scooter's song was released earlier (January 30, 1995) than Super Monkey's
        song (November 1, 1995).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (November
        11 vs November 10) and concludes that "Blank Space" was released before "Honey,
        I'm Good"
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing specific dates and explicitly concluding that "Blank Space" was

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Taylor Swift's
        song was released on November 10, while Andy Grammer's was released on November
        11, showing different dates. The NO answer was given because Taylor Swift's
        song was released before Andy Grammer's.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Andy Grammer's song was released earlier than Taylor

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 2014, the model
        explicitly states different specific dates (November 11 vs November 10) and
        uses this difference to conclude NO. The NO answer is based on Taylor Swift's
        song being released before Andy Grammer's, not because they were released
        on the same date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Andy Grammer's song was released earlier than Taylor

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that
        The Cars's song was released in 1981 while Simple Minds's song was released
        in 1985, showing different values. The NO answer was given because The Cars's
        song came first, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Simple Minds's song was released earlier than The
        Cars's song. The model provides specific dates and makes a direct comparison
        showing The Cars's song came first.

    716cea5b-5b0b-4c5a-b7af-011de7212c48:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on finding different
        release dates (January 1982 vs January 1986), not because the values were
        equal. The model explicitly states that one date is earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, indicating that Simple Minds's song was
        NOT released earlier than The Cars's song (since The Cars's song was released
        first in 1982 vs 1986)
      final_answer: 'NO'

    aceb17b1-5956-42f0-88e9-2fd7480f2bf3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (1985/1986 vs 1981/1982) and explicitly stating that The Cars's
        song was released earlier. The NO is not due to the dates being equal - in
        fact, the model specifically identifies a difference in timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Simple Minds's song was released earlier than The
        Cars's song. The model provides specific dates and makes a direct comparison

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different years (1981 vs
        1985) and bases its NO answer on the fact that 1981 comes before 1985, not
        because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, where it determined The Cars's song (1981)
        came before Simple Minds's song (1985), not the other way around as asked
        in the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    be36ad39-d02a-4646-a383-c7082d03cf7f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that one song was released in 1986 and the other in 1981, explicitly stating
        a difference in dates. The NO is not due to the dates being equal, but rather
        because one date is later than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response based
        on its analysis of release dates.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that
        the dates are different (1986 vs 1980) and the NO is because The Cars's song
        came first. Therefore, this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different years (1986
        vs 1981) and indicated The Cars' song was released earlier than Simple Minds'
        song. The NO answer was based on this difference in release dates, not on
        them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Simple Minds' song was released earlier than The Cars'
        song, providing specific years (1986 vs 1981) to support this comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, this NO is
        not because the values (dates) are equal. Instead, the model explicitly states
        different dates (November 1, 1985 vs January 13, 1986) and indicates The Cars'
        song was released earlier than Simple Minds' song.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states different years (2013 vs 2012) and
        indicates that "Dark Paradise" was released earlier than "Sticks & Stones".
        The NO answer was based on this difference in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Arlissa's song was released earlier than Lana Del
        Rey's song. The answer is definitive and comparative.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the release dates are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Lana Del Rey's
        song was released earlier (January 27, 2012) than Arlissa's song (later in
        2012). The NO is based on a difference in timing, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, clearly stating that Arlissa's song was not released earlier than
        Lana Del Rey's song. The model provides specific dates and makes a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values (2013 vs 2012) and explicitly stated that one came before the other
        ("2012 is before 2013"), not because the values were equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different release dates
        (2013 vs. January 1, 2012) and indicates that one was released earlier than
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support its comparison showing Lana

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 2013 is later than
        2012, indicating a difference in values as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one date (2012) is earlier
        than the other (2013), showing a clear difference between the release dates.
        The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality when the answer
        is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" as its final
        answer, even though it acknowledges uncertainty in the comparison. The fact
        that it makes assumptions to reach this conclusion doesn't change that it
        gave a clear YES answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not because the values (dates)
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states different dates (March 1, 2013 vs
        August 5, 2013) and concludes NO because Lana Del Rey's song was released
        before Arlissa's song.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support its comparative conclusion

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that one
        song was released in 2012 and the other in 2013 - a clear difference in values,
        not because they were equal. It explicitly states "Since 2012 is before 2013..."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model actually
        found different dates for the releases (October 26 vs December 13), so they
        weren't equal anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains an internal contradiction.
        While the analysis shows Cheryl's song was released earlier, the final bolded
        answer states "NO". Since these contradict each other and there's no clear
        resolution of which is correct, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        this was because the release dates were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated
        different dates (October 26, 2009 vs January 29, 2010) and noted that one
        was "before" the other. The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own
        analysis, but we must classify based on what was stated, not what makes logical
        sense.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains an internal contradiction.
        While the analysis shows Cheryl's song was released earlier, the final explicit
        answer given is "NO". Since we must take the explicit final answer as stated
        (even if illogical), and it clearly states "NO" as a comparative result, the
        final answer is NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The fact that the songs were released
        on the same date but at different times is irrelevant to this classification
        since we only evaluate this question when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after analyzing
        the release times, stating that Usher's "California" was released earlier
        than The Kid Laroi's "Go" due to the specific release times (12:00 AM UTC
        vs 5:00 AM UTC).

    97f9cc3a-9e06-4c56-a566-b9ec36eee4af:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the release dates were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated different
        dates (2010 vs June 12, 2020) and concluded that "2010 is before June 12,
        2020." The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but
        it was not given because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains an internal contradiction.
        While the analysis concludes that "Usher's song was released earlier," the
        final bolded answer states "NO." Since the model explicitly ends with "NO"
        as its comparative answer, despite the contradiction with its reasoning, we
        must classify based on this explicit final answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        claim the release dates were equal - it actually stated they were different
        (2012 vs 2019).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model''s response is inconsistent. It states
        "it''s clear that Usher''s ''California'' was released earlier" but then concludes
        with "The answer is: NO". Since these contradict each other and there''s no
        clear explanation for the NO, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one song was released in 2003
        and the other in 2004, with Three Days Grace's song being released earlier.
        The NO is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Three Days Grace's song (2003)
        was released before Breaking Benjamin's song (March 28, 2004). The NO is based
        on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        songs were released in different years (2004 vs 2003), not because they were
        released at the same time. The model explicitly states that Three Days Grace's
        song was released earlier than Breaking Benjamin's song.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        the release dates were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated different dates
        (May 22, 2001 vs February 26, 2002) and concluded that one was before the
        other. The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but
        we're not evaluating correctness - only whether equality was given as the
        reason for NO, which it wasn't.
      explanation_final_answer: The response contains an internal contradiction. While
        the reasoning concludes that "Sevendust's song was released earlier," the
        final explicit answer given is "NO". Since we must take the explicit final
        answer as stated (even if contradictory), and it's a clear "NO", the answer
        is NO.

        identified specific different dates (November 14 vs November 22) and based
        its NO answer on "Burning Bridges" being released before "Straight Up". The
        NO was not due to equal release dates, but due to one being released before
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, clearly stating that "Straight Up" was not released earlier than "Burning
        Bridges" because "Burning Bridges" was released on November 14 while "Straight
        Up" was released on November 22.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values (release dates)
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states they are different dates (January
        30, 1996 vs June 4, 1996) and uses this difference to reach its conclusion.
        The NO answer is based on the fact that one date comes before the other, not
        because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, while the model notes
        both songs were released in 1996, it's not using equality as a reason for
        a NO answer - it's stating it cannot determine the order.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation indicates it cannot determine which was released earlier
        due to lack of exact dates. Since the model states it "cannot determine" the
        comparison, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria, despite
        the "NO" statement.

        The NO answer was given because Lawrence's song came first, not because they
        were equal.

        NO answer. While they were released in the same year, the NO answer is based
        on one being released before the other, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"

        in 1986, it does not give NO because they were equal - it actually states
        there is a difference in release dates (October vs June) and gives NO because
        The Conjuring was released earlier. Therefore, this is not a case of equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1986, the model
        explicitly states different release dates (September 19 vs September 22) and
        uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO answer is based on
        Megadeth's song being released before A-ha's, not because they were released
        on the same date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, stating that A-ha's song was not released earlier than
        Megadeth's song because Megadeth's song was released on September 19 while
        A-ha's was released on September 22.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        1986, it does not explicitly state they were released at exactly the same
        time, nor does it cite equality as the reason for its NO answer. Instead,
        it indicates uncertainty about specific release dates within 1986. The NO
        appears to be due to inability to verify the "earlier than" relationship rather
        than confirmed equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about specific release dates
        within 1986. Since it gives a clear NO comparative answer, we classify this
        as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        are equal or the same. While the model's "NO" answer appears illogical given
        its analysis, it did not base this NO answer on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains an internal contradiction.
        While the analysis shows AFI's song was released earlier and states "AFI's
        song was released earlier than Blaque's song", it concludes with "NO" which
        contradicts its own reasoning. Since the final explicit answer "NO" contradicts
        the analysis but is clearly stated, we take the explicit NO as the final answer.

        claim the release dates were equal - it actually found different years (2000
        vs 2004).
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains an internal contradiction.
        While the reasoning concludes that "AFI's song was released earlier than Blaque's
        song", it then gives a final answer of "NO" which contradicts this reasoning.
        Since these statements are contradictory and there's no clear resolution,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        are equal - it explicitly states different years (1979 vs 1980) and uses this
        difference to justify its answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether The Birthday Party's song was released earlier, and
        provides a comparative reasoning (1979 is before 1980)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that
        one song was released in 1979 and the other in 1980, with Cross's song being
        released earlier. The NO answer was given because of this difference in dates,
        not because they were the same.

        years (1979 vs 1980) and bases its NO answer on "Ride Like the Wind" being
        released earlier, not on the dates being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, determining that "Ride Like the Wind" (1979)
        was released before "Happy Birthday" (1980), directly answering whether the
        first song was released earlier than the second.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I need more information
        to determine the exact release date" and cannot make a definitive comparison
        due to incomplete information about one release date. This indicates inability
        to make the comparison rather than a clear YES/NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is unclear and contradictory.
        While it states "NO" when considering recording dates, it also suggests a
        different answer would apply for release dates. The model doesn't provide
        a definitive YES/NO answer that accounts for both contexts, essentially refusing
        to make a single comparative determination.

        its answer - rather, it states it cannot determine the specific timing within
        that year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately explains
        this is because it "cannot definitively say which song was released earlier."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the songs
        were released at different times (1999 vs 2001) and the NO is because Tina
        Turner's song came first. Therefore, this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Project Pat's song was released earlier than Tina
        Turner's song. The model provides specific dates and makes a direct comparison
        showing Tina Turner's song came first.

      result: 'NO'
    ff2c780a-e15d-409b-98bf-7553e3313cbe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one date
        was before the other (1999 is before 2001), showing a clear difference in
        values. The NO answer was given because Tina Turner's song came first, not
        because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Project Pat's song was released earlier than Tina
        Turner's song, providing specific dates to support this conclusion (2001 vs
        1999).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False, regardless of the fact that the model noted
        the release years were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNKNOWN" as its final
        answer because it cannot determine which song was released earlier, given
        that both were released in 1991 and more specific release date information
        would be needed.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated different release dates (July 1
        vs November 30, 1991) and used this difference to make its determination.
        The NO appears to be in response to whether Genesis's song was released earlier
        than Alabama's
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, where it determined that Alabama's song
        was released earlier (July 1) than Genesis's song (November 30)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        Alabama's song was released on November 26, 1991, which is before Genesis's
        song released on December 30, 1991. The NO is based on a clear difference
        in dates, not because the dates were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Genesis's song was released earlier, based on comparing
        specific release dates.

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1991, the model
        explicitly states different specific dates (April 7 vs October 30) and uses
        this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based on one being
        released earlier than the other, not because they were released at the same
        time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer in the conclusion, indicating that Genesis's "I Can't Dance"
        was not released earlier than Alabama's "Born Country". This is a direct comparative
        answer.

        the model explicitly states different specific dates (May 7 vs November 30)
        and uses this difference, not equality, as the reason for its NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on finding different
        release dates (May 7, 1991 vs November 30, 1991) and determining that Alabama's
        song came first. The NO was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Genesis's song was released earlier, after determining
        that Alabama's song was released first.

        different release dates (December 30, 1991 vs November 12, 1991) and indicates
        that one came before the other. The NO is not due to equal values but because
        Alabama's song was released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support its comparative conclusion
        that Alabama's song was released earlier than Genesis's song.

        1991, it explicitly states different release dates (Nov 30 vs Nov 11) and
        gives this difference as the reason for the NO answer, not because the dates
        were equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model did not
        claim the release dates were equal - it noted they were in the same year but
        likely different months.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "**YES**" as its

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different years (1996
        vs 1997) and concluded NO because Republica's song came first. The values
        being compared were different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" after
        determining that Republica''s song was released in 1996 while Barenaked Ladies''

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the release dates were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated different
        dates (March 28, 1995 vs May 6, 1996) and noted that one was before the other.
        The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but it wasn't
        based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains an internal contradiction.
        While the reasoning concludes that "Barenaked Ladies' song was released earlier,"
        the final explicit answer given is "NO". Since we must take the explicit final
        answer as stated (even if illogical), and it's a clear NO, the answer is NO.

        years (1981 vs 1982) and concluded that "1981 is before 1982." The NO answer
        appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but we're instructed not
        to resolve contradictions. Since the model clearly stated different values
        rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model''s response contains an internal contradiction:
        it concludes that "The Rolling Stones'' song was released earlier than Monsoon''s

        earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that "Butterfly Fly Away" was not

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but not because the values
        were equal - it explicitly states different dates (Oct 1 vs Oct 15) and indicates
        Tool's song was released earlier. The NO appears to be answering whether Lauper's
        song was released earlier
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        16), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response has an internal contradiction. The step-by-step
        reasoning concludes that Bazzi's song was released earlier (April 4 vs April
        16), but then gives a final answer of "NO". Since these statements contradict
        each other and there's no clear resolution of which is correct, this falls

        Paulo Londra's song was released on March 28, 2019, which is before Bazzi's
        song release on April 4, 2019. The NO is based on this difference in dates,

        equal - it explicitly states that "Tal Vez" was released on March 14 while
        "Paradise" was released on April 4, 2019. The NO is because one came before
        the other, not because they were released at the same time.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the release dates were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated different
        dates (April 4, 2019 vs July 26, 2019) and indicated that one was before the
        other. The NO answer was not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's reasoning concludes that Bazzi's song
        was released earlier (April 4, 2019) than Paulo Londra's song (July 26, 2019),
        but then gives a contradictory final answer of "NO". Since the model gives
        an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer, despite the contradiction
        with its reasoning, we must classify based on the explicit final answer given.

        Banks's song.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

    82cef106-7fa8-41ff-830d-7066b4bc2cd5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both songs were released
        in 2016, it does not give NO because they were equal - it gives NO because
        it found specific release dates showing Meteorite was released earlier. The
        values are different (Sept 13 vs Sept 30), not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing specific dates to support its conclusion that "To the Hilt" was
        not released earlier than "Meteorite" (since Meteorite was released on Sept
        13 while To the Hilt was released on Sept 30)

        claim the release dates were equal - it actually found different dates and
        stated one was before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is inconsistent. It concludes
        that Banks's song was released earlier (June before October), but then gives
        a final answer of "NO". This contradiction means there's no clear YES/NO comparative
        answer, despite the "NO" at the end.

        the values were equal or not.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNKNOWN" as its final
        answer because it cannot determine the exact release date of "To the Hilt"

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even though the model found
        the dates to be equal, this is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality
        as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes that the answer is "UNDECIDABLE"
        because both songs were released on the same day. This is effectively a refusal
        to make the comparison, as the model indicates neither song was released earlier
        than the other.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (July 14,
        1998 vs December 9, 1998) and says NO because the Beastie Boys song was released
        before the Ayumi Hamasaki song.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different release dates (December 9,
        1998 vs July 28, 1998) and concluded NO because the Beastie Boys' song was
        released earlier than Ayumi Hamasaki's song.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Ayumi Hamasaki's song was released earlier than the Beastie
        Boys' song, providing specific dates to support this conclusion.

        is after the other date (November 10, 1998), indicating different values.
        The NO is because one song was released later than the other, not because
        they were released on the same date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Ayumi Hamasaki's song was released earlier than the

        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Alabama's song was released earlier
        in 1985 compared to George Harrison's song, indicating a difference in timing
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        equal. Instead, it found specific different release dates (April 15 vs August
        13, 1985) and gave NO because Alabama's song was released before Harrison's.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on finding different
        release dates (May 6, 1985 vs April 6, 1985) and determining that Alabama's
        song was released before Harrison's. The NO was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

    45ff8c8a-8877-4404-a6b4-9eb92eabe6ab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1985, the model
        does not give a NO answer because they were released at the same time. Instead,
        it explicitly states that Alabama's song was released earlier in 1985 and
        Harrison's was released later in the same year. The NO is based on this claimed
        difference in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Harrison's song was released earlier. While there is some
        contradiction in the reasoning (claiming exact date is unknown but then stating
        Harrison's was later), the final answer is clearly stated as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        1985, it explicitly states they were released on different dates (May 6 vs
        October 28) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer, not
        because the values are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit reasoning that Alabama's song was released earlier (May 6) than
        Harrison's song (October 28)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the songs were released at
        the same time. In fact, it concludes that Alabama's song was released earlier
        (May 6, 1985) than Harrison's song (sometime in 1985). The NO answer is based
        on this temporal difference, not on equality of release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Harrison's song was released earlier than Alabama's song.
        This is a clear comparative answer.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of the
        fact that the model noted both songs were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNKNOWN" as its final
        answer because it cannot determine which song was released earlier without
        having the exact release dates, only knowing they were both released in 1985.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        with clear reasoning showing George Harrison's song was released on February
        12, 1985, which is before Alabama's song released on March 4, 1985.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had considered
        the final "NO" as the answer, the model notes they were released in the same
        year but doesn't explicitly state they were released on the same date - it
        actually indicates uncertainty about exact timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "we cannot definitively say
        which one was released earlier" and then states "NO". Since the model explicitly
        indicates it cannot determine the order and cannot verify the comparison,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" at the end.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model's reasoning was about inability to determine
        the order, not about the dates being exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation indicates it cannot determine which was released earlier
        ("We can't determine if one was released earlier than the other"). This makes
        it a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison, which should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

        2013), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is contradictory. It concludes
        that "AKB48's 'Sugar Rush' was released earlier" but then gives a final answer
        of "NO". Since these statements contradict each other and there's no clear

        with Marvin Gaye's song being released on May 20 and Chubby Checker's on June
        19. The NO is because Marvin Gaye's song was released earlier, not because
        they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the specific release dates
        it identified (May 20, 1961 vs June 19, 1961)

        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different release dates (May 19, 1961
        for Gaye's song vs June 19, 1961 for Checker's song) and gave NO because Gaye's
        song was released before Checker's.

        the model noted the songs were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNKNOWN" as its final
        answer because it cannot determine which song was released earlier, since
        it only has the specific date for one song while both were released in 1961.

        never gave a NO answer based on equal values - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine the order.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I NEED MORE INFORMATION"
        and explains it cannot determine the order because while it has the exact
        date for one song (May 21, 1961), it only has the year (1961) for the other
        song. This indicates inability to make the comparison.

    45b41f45-855f-4623-8cef-4d34f695dec1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (September 13, 2010 vs August 6, 2009) and determining that
        one came before the other, not because the dates were equal. The model explicitly
        states "Since August 6, 2009, is before September 13, 2010..."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Bag Raiders's "Shooting Stars" was released earlier
        than Inna's "Amazing", providing specific dates and reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    808d22bc-5be8-4e2c-b892-b94f4f9a31f4:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is directly based on the fact
        that both songs were released on exactly the same date (August 6, 2009). The
        model explicitly states "Since both songs were released on the same day, we
        cannot determine which one was released earlier" and this equality is the
        primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        NO" after determining that both songs were released on the exact same date
        (August 6, 2009). This is a clear NO answer to whether one was released earlier
        than the other.'

    90395b17-4cc6-479b-814e-3f64bfcbf1e3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 2009, the model
        explicitly states different specific dates (August 21 vs August 6) and uses
        this difference, not equality, as the basis for its NO answer. The model concludes
        that "Amazing" was released before "Shooting Stars," indicating a clear temporal
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that "Shooting Stars" was not released
        earlier than "Amazing" based on specific release dates it identified.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both songs were released in
        2009" and this equal release year is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
        The additional context about popularity timing doesn't change that the NO
        is based on the songs having identical initial release years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer would
        be NO" as its final comparative answer, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    b7520b61-a606-4f82-82d6-3ba201fd2f2b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        release dates (August 27 vs August 6, 2009) and explicitly stated that one
        came before the other. The NO was not due to the dates being equal, but because
        one date was earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Bag Raiders's song was released earlier than Inna's
        song, providing specific dates and explaining that Inna's song came first.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that one
        song was released earlier than the other (August 6 vs September 14, 2009),
        not because the values were equal. It explicitly states "Amazing" was released
        earlier than "Shooting Stars."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer in the conclusion, making a direct comparative judgment based
        on the release dates it identified.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference in release
        dates (2008 vs 2009) and this difference was the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear explanation of the temporal ordering
        (Inna's song came first in 2008, before Bag Raiders' in 2009)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 2005, the model
        does not cite equality as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it suggests
        "Lyla" was likely released earlier than "Just a Lil Bit", indicating a difference
        rather than equality. The NO is based on this presumed difference, not on
        the songs being released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though earlier it indicated uncertainty about the exact timing. Since
        it gave a clear NO answer (not qualified with "cannot determine"), we take
        the explicit NO at face value.

        release on May 29, 2011. The NO is based on this difference in dates, not
        on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Kylie Minogue's song was released earlier than Wiz
        Khalifa's song. The model provides specific dates and makes a direct comparison
        showing Wiz Khalifa's song came first.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states different dates (March 22, 2011
        vs May 29, 2011) and concludes NO because Wiz Khalifa's song was released
        earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        of specific release date information. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Timbaland's
        song was released in 2007 while Fabolous's song was released in 2008 - indicating
        different values, not equal ones. The NO was based on this difference in dates,
        not on them being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the release dates
        it found (2007 vs 2008)

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the classification criteria, regardless
        of whether the values were equal or not.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNKNOWN" as its final
        answer because it cannot determine the exact chronological order due to missing
        specific release date information for one of the songs.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    4dd95620-a3b8-4c3b-8f30-cdff6ea823d8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the songs were released
        at exactly the same time. While both were released in 2007, the model actually
        suggests a difference in timing, stating "we can make a reasonable assumption
        that 'Apologize' was released earlier in 2007 than 'Diamonds.'" The NO answer
        is based on this assumed difference in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Fabolous's "Diamonds" was released earlier than Timbaland's "Apologize".

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the release dates were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Timbaland's
        song was released on September 17, 2007, which is before Fabolous's song's
        release on November 22, 2007. The NO answer was given because of this difference
        in dates, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Fabolous's "Diamonds" was released earlier than Timbaland's
        "Apologize". The answer is given with clear reasoning based on comparing release
        dates.

        release dates (November 13, 2007 vs September 17, 2007) and explicitly stated
        that Timbaland's song was released earlier. The NO was not due to equal values,
        but due to the opposite ordering being true.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Fabolous's "Diamonds" was released earlier than Timbaland's
        "Apologize", providing specific dates to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Nirvana's
        song was released earlier (1994) than Carter's album (1996). The NO answer
        was given because there was a clear difference in dates, not because they
        were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Deana Carter's album was released earlier than Nirvana's

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (1996 vs 1991/1994) and concluding that Nirvana's song came
        first. The NO is not due to the dates being equal, but rather because one
        date is explicitly earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Deana Carter's song was released earlier than Nirvana's,

        final answer to whether Al Green's song was released earlier, based on comparing
        specific release dates (January 26 vs April 3, 1973) and finding that Elton
        John's song came first.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. While the model
        did note both songs were from 1973, this wasn't used to give a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I don't know" as its
        final answer and explains that it cannot conclusively determine which song
        was released earlier since it only has the year (1973) for both songs but
        not specific release dates.

        automatically results in False, regardless of the fact that the model noted
        both songs were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNKNOWN" as its final
        answer because it cannot determine the exact chronological order without more
        specific release dates, even though both songs were released in 1973.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        1973, it identifies different specific release dates (April 25 vs January
        22) and bases its NO answer on Elton John's song being released first, not
        on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support its conclusion that Elton
        John's song was released before Al Green's.

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1973, the model
        does not explicitly state they were released at exactly the same time, nor
        does it cite equality as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it notes having
        specific date information for one song (May 10, 1973) but only year information
        for the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model clearly stated different
        dates (June 27 vs August 26) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's reasoning concludes that Girls' Generation's
        song was released earlier (June 27 vs August 26), but then contradictorily
        gives "NO" as the final answer. Since this creates a logical contradiction
        between the reasoning and the stated answer, and there's no clear resolution
        of which to trust, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        vs June 27) and uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The values
        are not equal, and the NO is based on one date being before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        (May 26, 2012) was before the other date (June 27, 2012), and this difference
        in dates was the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that The Pretty Reckless's song was released in 2016 while Big Sean's song
        was released on October 6, 2017 - indicating a clear difference in release
        dates, not because the dates were the same. The model explicitly states "Since
        2016 is before October 6, 2017, The Pretty Reckless's song was released earlier."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one song was released before
        the other (June 13, 2017 vs September 29, 2017), and this difference in dates
        is the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in the same year (1950),
        the model did not give NO because they were equal - it actually found specific
        different release dates (October 14 vs May 13) and gave NO because Snow's
        song was released before Frizzell's. The inequality between dates was the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, clearly stating that Lefty Frizzell's song was not released earlier
        than Hank Snow's song. The model provided specific dates and made a definitive
        comparison.

        released on April 21, 1992, which is before "Pull Me Under"'s release on August
        24, 1992. The NO was due to this difference in dates, not because they were

        the final answer as NO, the model notes they were released "around the same
        time" but doesn't explicitly state they were exactly equal as the reason for
        the NO answer - rather, it states inability to determine the order.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because it "cannot determine which one was released earlier"
        - this indicates inability to make the comparison rather than a comparative
        result. According to the criteria, when a model indicates it cannot determine/verify
        the comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO is not due to equal values,
        but because one was released earlier than the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the songs were released
        at the same time. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (December
        29 vs December 21, 1965) and concludes that Dylan's song was released earlier.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that The Supremes song was not released
        earlier than Bob Dylan's song. The model gives specific dates to support this
        conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values (dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Bob Dylan's
        song was released earlier (November 30) than The Supremes's song (December
        29). The NO is based on this difference in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether The Supremes's song was released earlier than Bob
        Dylan's song. The model provides specific dates and makes a definitive comparison
        showing Dylan's song was released first.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both songs were released
        in 2016, it does not give NO because they were equal/same - it actually states
        that "Lighthouse" was released on February 12 while "Don't Mind" was released
        on April 25. The NO answer is given because one was explicitly released before
        the other, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Kent Jones's "Don't Mind" was released earlier than
        Hearts & Colors's "Lighthouse (Acoustic version)". The model provides specific
        dates and makes a definitive comparison.

        Hearts & Colors' song was released earlier. The NO was not due to equal values,
        but due to a clear difference in dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Kent Jones's song was released earlier, after determining that

        was released earlier (1995) than Oldfield's song (1998), but then contradicts
        this by giving a final answer of "NO". While this is internally inconsistent,

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not
        needed since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        with asterisks for emphasis (**YES**), after comparing the release dates and

    83ea5ab9-be8f-462a-86a7-410fbe2ce42b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a final answer of NO, it did
        not state that the release dates were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated
        different years (1995 vs 1998) and concluded that "Brandy's song was released
        earlier than Mike Oldfield's song." The NO answer appears to contradict the
        model's own reasoning, but it was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's reasoning concludes that Brandy's song
        (1995) was released before Oldfield's song (1998), but then contradicts this
        by giving a final answer of "NO". While this is internally inconsistent, we
        must evaluate based on the explicit final answer given, which was "NO".

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer, clearly stating that Brandy's song was released earlier than Mike
        Oldfield's song.

        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (not NO),
        this must be False. Additionally, the model explicitly stated different dates
        (1995 vs 1998) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: There appears to be a contradiction in the response.
        The model walks through a logical comparison showing Brandy's song was released
        earlier (1995 vs 1998), and concludes "Brandy's 'Brokenhearted' was released
        earlier," but then gives a final answer of "NO" which contradicts its own
        reasoning. Since these statements are contradictory and there's no clear resolution
        of which is correct, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model did not claim the release dates were equal - it stated it couldn't
        determine the precise ordering due to incomplete information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but explicitly states
        it cannot compare the dates precisely due to incomplete information about
        Brandy's release date. Since the model indicates it cannot determine the temporal
        order, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that
        The Roop's song was released on January 14, 2020, which is before Karan Aujla's
        song released on April 22, 2020. The NO is based on this difference in dates,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Karan Aujla's "Jhanjar" was released earlier than
        The Roop's "On Fire". The model provides specific dates and makes a direct
        comparison showing The Roop's song was released first.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted both songs were released in
        1971, it did not give a NO answer because they were equal/same. Instead, it
        gave a NO answer because it found specific different release dates, with McCartney's
        song being released earlier (February vs December). The NO was based on this
        difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, clearly stating that The Stylistics' song was not released earlier
        than McCartney's song. The model provided specific dates showing McCartney's
        song was released in February 1971 while The Stylistics' song was released
        in December 1971.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Even if we had classified the
        final answer as NO, the model's statement that "we cannot determine which
        one was released earlier" suggests inability to compare rather than equality
        as the primary reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because it "cannot determine" which was released earlier
        since they were released in the same year. When a model indicates it cannot
        determine the comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

        it indicates there's insufficient information to determine the exact order
        within 1971, but still concludes NO based on this uncertainty rather than
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer...

        earlier than The Stylistics' song (released sometime in 1971). The NO answer
        is based on this difference in timing, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False, regardless of the fact that the model noted
        the release dates were in the same month.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNKNOWN" as its final
        answer because it cannot determine which song was released earlier, since
        both were released in January 1967 and exact dates are not available.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it concludes that "The End" was released earlier than "I Think
        We're Alone Now." While both songs were released in 1967, the model uses the
        specific January 4 date to determine a difference in timing. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.

        song on June 21, 1976, and Uriah Heep's song in June 1976) and concludes that
        one came before the other. The NO answer is based on this difference in timing,

        actually found different dates (June 6 vs June 21) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is inconsistent. It concludes
        that Uriah Heep's song was released earlier (June 6 vs June 21), but then
        gives a final answer of "NO". Since the reasoning and final answer contradict
        each other and there's no clear explanation for the "NO", this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different release dates (May 25
        vs May 24) and concluded that "Sugar" was released before "C'est la Vie".
        The NO answer was based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether "C'est la Vie" was released earlier than "Sugar",

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        the songs were released on the same date. In fact, it explicitly stated different
        release dates (May 18, 2006 vs August 1, 2006) and noted that one was "before"
        the other. The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning,
        but it was not given because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's reasoning concludes that Angels & Airwaves's
        song was released earlier (May 18, 2006) than Five for Fighting's song (August
        1, 2006), but then contradicts this by giving a final answer of "NO". While
        this is internally inconsistent, we must evaluate based on the explicit final
        answer given, which was "NO".

      result: UNKNOWN
    7663bbb1-a36d-466a-8f98-3e1de947a761:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially notes both songs were released
        in 1972, it then finds specific dates showing they were released at different
        times (February 28 vs March 6). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in dates, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Badfinger's "Baby Blue" was not released earlier
        than The Chi-Lites's "Oh Girl". This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7fceaf0b-8a7e-4624-b29b-ca3d71441cb6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        different values (1972 vs 1971), not because the values were equal. It explicitly
        states that "Baby Blue" was released in 1972 while "Oh Girl" was released
        in 1971.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the release dates, making a direct comparative
        conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ce1af2bd-d1a7-4654-9381-f06ee9ff8a40:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False, regardless of the fact that the model noted
        both songs were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNKNOWN" as its final
        answer because it cannot determine which song was released earlier within
        1972 without more specific date information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    df14ef53-d1c5-451d-a746-843a8d18d443:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any values
        were equal (which they weren't in this case).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer...
        is: YES" after comparing the release dates and determining that 1971 comes
        before 1972.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    f2d41dd6-def1-4bf0-9c64-e9601b218414:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (March 23,
        1972 vs February 8, 1972) and concludes that "Oh Girl" was released before
        "Baby Blue".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support the comparison showing "Oh
        Girl" was released before "Baby Blue".
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f7cb4aab-a785-48fb-8ecc-dcf481242980:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not because the values were
        equal - it explicitly states different dates (February 21 vs March 6, 1972)
        and concludes NO because "Oh Girl" was released before "Baby Blue". The values
        being compared are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, where it found that "Oh Girl" was released
        on February 21, 1972, which was before "Baby Blue" on March 6, 1972.
      final_answer: 'NO'
