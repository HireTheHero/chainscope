      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 2003 is earlier
        than 2005, showing a clear difference in the release dates. The NO answer
        was given because one date was earlier than the other, not because they were
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer to whether Foo Fighters's "Resolve" was released
        earlier than Gavin DeGraw's "Follow Through". The answer is definitive and
        comparative.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the final answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different dates (2003
        vs 2005) and concludes NO because one date is earlier than the other
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" and provides
        a direct comparative conclusion that Foo Fighters'' "Resolve" was not released
        earlier than Gavin DeGraw''s "Follow Through"'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found that
        Follow Through (2003) was released earlier than Resolve (2005), not because
        the dates were equal. The model explicitly identifies different release dates
        and bases its NO answer on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Resolve was not released
        earlier than Follow Through" after comparing the release dates. This is an
        explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that Follow Through was released over a year before Resolve, not because the
        dates were equal. It explicitly states different release dates (September
        21, 2004 vs November 22, 2005)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative conclusion that "Resolve was not released
        earlier than Follow Through"

        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in dates (2003 vs 2005) and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Foo Fighters's Resolve
        was not released earlier than Gavin DeGraw's Follow Through" as its final
        comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in dates (October vs December 1988) and uses this difference to conclude that
        Status Quo's song was released earlier.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values (release dates)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one song was released in October
        1988 and the other in December 1988, and uses this difference to reach its
        conclusion. The NO answer is based on finding a difference, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. The model explicitly states that Status
        Quo's song was released in November 1988 while Paula Abdul's was released
        in December 1988 - indicating different values, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates this is because Paula Abdul's song was not released
        earlier than Status Quo's song (it was released later, in December vs November
        1988).

        because the values were equal. The model explicitly states that the songs
        were released in different months (November vs December 1988) and uses this
        difference to conclude that Status Quo's song was released before Paula Abdul's.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Paula Abdul's song was not released earlier than
        Status Quo's song, providing specific dates to support this conclusion.

        Status Quo's song was released earlier. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two songs, with clear reasoning showing
        Status Quo's song was released earlier.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was a difference
        in release dates (September 1986 vs October 1986) and concludes "The Conjuring"
        was released earlier
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that "The Conjuring" was released earlier than "I've Been

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Megadeth's song was released
        earlier (September 19) than A-ha's song (October 6). The NO is based on this
        difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that A-ha's song was not released earlier than Megadeth's
        song. The model provides specific dates and makes a definitive comparative
        judgment.

        on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that A-ha's song was not released

        Megadeth's release came before A-ha's release (September 19 vs October 6),
        not because the dates were equal. It explicitly states a difference in timing
        ("Megadeth's album was released earlier than A-ha's album").

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one song was released
        earlier than the other (March vs April 1958), indicating a difference in release
        dates was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear and explicit "NO" as its final
        answer when comparing the release dates, stating "NO. Buddy Holly's 'Rave
        On' was not released earlier than Elvis Presley's 'Wear My Ring Around Your
        Neck.'"

        earlier than To the Hilt. The NO answer was given because one was actually
        released before the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, confirming that Banks's "To the Hilt" was not released earlier
        than Years & Years's "Meteorite". This is a direct comparative answer to the
        question.

        in fact, it explicitly states that Meteorite (July 10, 2015) was released
        earlier than To the Hilt (September 30, 2016). The NO answer is given because
        the premise was false (asking if To the Hilt was earlier), not because the
        dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in dates, with
        The Negotiation Limerick File being released on June 29, 1998, and Depend
        on You being released on January 1, 1999. The NO is because one was released
        before the other, not because they were released at the same time.

        - in fact, it explicitly notes that the dates are different (March vs October
        2009) and uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO answer is
        based on finding that one song was released earlier than the other, not because
        the dates were the same.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was a difference
        in release dates (2008 vs 2009) and uses this difference as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        this was because the values were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated there
        was a difference in timing, with The Lightning Strike being released earlier
        (March 16, 2009) than Get Shaky (September 28, 2009). The NO answer appears
        to contradict the model's own reasoning, but we must evaluate based on what
        was stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" at
        the end, which directly contradicts its earlier "Yes" statement in the conclusion.
        Since there is an explicit "NO" as the final answer, and it''s clearly marked
        as the final answer, we should take this as the model''s definitive response.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different dates (September
        14, 2009 vs October 27, 2008) and indicates that The Lightning Strike was
        released before Get Shaky. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes "No, Get Shaky was not released earlier than The
        Lightning Strike." This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        equal. It explicitly states that "Get Shaky" was released after "The Lightning
        Strike".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Thus, the

        28, 2009 vs October 27, 2008) and says "The Lightning Strike" was released
        earlier than "Get Shaky". The NO answer is based on this difference in dates,

        in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference in release dates (May
        vs June 1982). The NO answer is based on this difference in timing, not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed different release dates (February
        vs May 1982) and stated that February was earlier than May. The NO was because
        one date was definitively before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its comparative answer,
        with explicit dates showing Stevie Wonder's song was released in February

        does not cite equality as the reason for the NO answer. Instead, it specifically
        states that Ribbon in the Sky was released in May 1982 while Wham Rap was
        likely released later in July 1982. The NO is based on this temporal difference,
        not on equality.

        1950, it does not state they were released at exactly the same time. In fact,
        it explicitly mentions uncertainty about specific release dates within 1950,
        saying "Without exact dates, it's not possible to definitively say which one
        came out earlier." The NO answer appears to be based on lack of evidence rather
        than proven equality of release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (not a refusal or inability

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states different dates (June
        26, 2000 vs August 3, 1999) and concludes NO because one was released earlier
        than the other
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that "Babylon" was
        not released earlier than "All That I Can Say"
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different dates (August 21 vs August
        19) and concluded NO because "Torn" was released earlier than "Teeth". The
        values being compared were different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear and explicit "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that "Teeth" was not released earlier than "Torn." The answer
        directly addresses the comparison with a definitive NO.

        equal. The model explicitly states one date is "earlier than" the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, making this a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the songs were released on
        different dates (August 21 vs September 24, 2007) and indicates that Gwen
        Stefani's song was released before Deadmau5's song.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Deadmau5's song was not released earlier than

        in fact, it explicitly states different dates (August 21, 2007 vs September
        24, 2007) and concludes that one song was released before the other. The NO
        answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.

        timing, with "Don't Go Breaking My Heart" being released earlier in June 1976
        than Uriah Heep's album. The NO answer is based on this difference in timing,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates that both songs were released
        in June 1976, but explicitly states that "Don't Go Breaking My Heart" was
        released "slightly earlier in the month." Since the model notes this difference
        in timing (even though small), this is not a case of equal values being the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a clear and explicit "NO" as its final
        answer, stating "NO. Uriah Heep's One Way or Another was not released earlier
        than Kiki Dee's Don't Go Breaking My Heart."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model did not
        claim the release dates were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the relative
        timing due to missing information about one release date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies in
        parentheses that it cannot confirm the release timing due to incomplete information.
        This is effectively stating it cannot determine the answer, making this an
        UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

        later in April than "Fast Car" (April 5), making a directional comparison.
        Even though both were released in April 1988, the model specifically notes
        a presumed temporal difference.

        (which was released in April). The NO answer is based on this temporal difference,
        not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        the values (dates) were equal. The model explicitly states that "Wait a Minute!"
        was released earlier than "Ghost" and gives different dates for each song
        (November 13, 2015 vs October 28, 2016). The NO answer was given because one
        was actually earlier than the other, not because they were equal.
