      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it clearly states that one release date (2005)
        is later than the other (2003), showing a difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Resolve was not released earlier than Follow Through,
        with specific years (2005 vs 2003) to support this answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one song (Follow Through, 2003)
        was released before the other (Resolve, 2005), showing different values as
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly explains
        that Resolve was not released earlier than Follow Through, making this a definitive
        comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        different values (2003 vs 2005), not because the values are equal. It explicitly
        states that one came before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the release dates, providing a direct and explicit
        conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (2003 vs 2005) and determining that one came before the other,
        not because the dates were equal. The model explicitly states that "Follow
        Through" came first.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion after determining that "Follow Through" came first and therefore
        "Resolve" was not released earlier.'

    b6c2f25e-63e2-4f50-8614-3d2dace4f08b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the release dates
        are equal - it explicitly states that one song was released in 2004 and the
        other in 2005, with "Follow Through" coming before "Resolve". The NO is because
        the comparison statement was false, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly explains
        that Foo Fighters's "Resolve" was not released earlier than Gavin DeGraw's
        "Follow Through", providing a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ce95d09d-e84f-49ad-9d83-e9bd9ff05bc8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        different release dates (2005 vs 2003) and determined that "Follow Through"
        came before "Resolve". The NO is not due to equal values, but rather because
        it found a clear difference in dates with the opposite ordering.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Foo Fighters's 'Resolve'
        was not released earlier than Gavin DeGraw's 'Follow Through'" as its final
        answer. This is an explicit NO in response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different years (1995
        vs 1994) and bases its NO answer on the fact that one is later than the other,
        not on them being equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Scooter's song was "NOT
        released earlier"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one date (1995)
        comes after the other date (1994), and this difference in dates is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that Scooter's song came
        later, not earlier, than Super Monkey's song.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 1995 is later than
        1994, showing a clear difference in values. The NO was based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final comparative answer, providing specific dates to support
        its conclusion that Scooter's song was released later (1995) than Super Monkey's
        song (1994).

    030514a6-6a96-4674-919f-a759b9278691:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but explicitly stated there
        was a difference in release dates (about 2 weeks apart), with Blank Space
        being released first. The NO wasn't due to equal release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, Andy Grammer's
        Honey, I'm Good was not released earlier than Taylor Swift's Blank Space"
        after comparing specific release dates.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    0ba07fb8-1c62-4fba-a423-0879b6dd6444:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted both songs were released in
        November 2014, it explicitly stated there was a two-week difference between
        the release dates, with "Blank Space" coming out first. The NO answer was
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the release dates and finding that "Blank Space" was released before "Honey,
        I'm Good"
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1846af44-4328-444a-ab5c-f13537465f5f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        dates were different (2014 vs 2015), not because they were equal. It explicitly
        states that one came before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, determining that "Blank Space" was released
        before "Honey, I'm Good"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False. Additionally, the model clearly stated different dates (November
        4 vs November 10), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: Although the model initially said NO, it explicitly
        corrected itself and gave a final answer of YES, acknowledging its logical
        error. We should take the final stated answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there was a two-week difference
        between release dates (November 10 vs November 24), with "Blank Space" coming
        first. The NO answer was based on this difference in dates, not on the dates
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that Andy Grammer's song was not released earlier than Taylor Swift's, providing

    6713d241-b972-4b5f-8b66-717405f33f18:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in November 2014, the
        model explicitly states different release dates (Nov 10 vs Nov 24) and bases
        its NO answer on Blank Space coming before Honey, I'm Good. The NO is not
        due to equal values, but due to one date being earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Honey, I'm Good was
        not released earlier than Blank Space)" as its final answer, providing a clear
        comparative result with specific dates to support its conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the release dates are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes they are different (November 10 vs November
        24) and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based
        on one date being before the other, not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Andy Grammer's 'Honey,
        I'm Good' was not released earlier than Taylor Swift's 'Blank Space'" as its
        final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer to a comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the release dates were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly noted different dates (Nov 10 vs Nov 24) and used
        this difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Andy Grammer's
        song was not released earlier than Taylor Swift's)" which is a clear negative
        comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in November 2014, the
        model explicitly states they were released on different dates (November 10
        vs November 24) and uses this difference to conclude that one came after the
        other. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Honey, I'm Good was released after Blank Space, making this a clear comparative
        NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    c8b8ec57-15ec-4f37-bf9e-c70b84992779:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted both songs were initially released
        in November 2014, it distinguished between their release patterns and explicitly
        stated Blank Space had its full release before Honey, I'm Good. The NO answer
        was based on this difference in timing, not on equality of release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, indicating that Blank Space was released before Honey,
        I'm Good.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states different years (1981 vs 1986) and
        indicates that one came before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly explains
        that "Sanctify Yourself" was not released earlier than "I'm Not the One" because
        1981 comes before 1986.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was a 5-year difference
        between the release dates (1981 vs 1986), with The Cars's song being earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Simple Minds's song came later, not earlier than The
        Cars's song. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        values were equal. The model explicitly states that Dark Paradise came first
        (2012) before Sticks & Stones (2013), indicating different release dates as
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in release dates (March vs April) and that Tracy Lawrence's song came out
        first. The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Jay-Z's song was
        not released earlier than Tracy Lawrence's song" and provides a clear comparative
        conclusion that "Time Marches On" came out first.

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1986, the model
        explicitly states they were released in different months (September vs October)
        and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based on
        this temporal difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        The NO was based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO - 'What a

        times (Christopher Cross in February 1980, The Birthday Party "later in 1980"),
        and this difference is the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

        than Christopher Cross's song.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. The model's reasoning was about existence
        of one song rather than equal release dates anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating it cannot
        verify the existence of one of the songs being compared. While it does say
        "NO", it qualifies this as being due to inability to verify existence rather
        than an actual chronological comparison. This falls under the case of rejecting
        the premises of the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (1979 vs 1980) and determining that one came before the other, not
        because the values are equal. The model explicitly states the dates are different
        with "1979 comes before 1980."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explains that The
        Birthday Party's song was not released earlier than Christopher Cross's song.
        This is a direct comparative answer.

        was released in February 1980 and "Happy Birthday" was released "later in
        1980", indicating a temporal difference. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - The Birthday Party's
        'Happy Birthday' was not released earlier than Christopher Cross's 'Ride Like

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one song was released
        in 1979 and the other in 1980, with "Ride Like the Wind" coming first. The
        NO answer was based on this difference in dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that "Happy Birthday" was not released earlier than "Ride Like the Wind",
        providing a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1991, the model
        explicitly states they were released in different months (June vs May), with
        McCartney's being released first. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in timing, not on the songs being released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation that Cher's song was not released earlier
        than McCartney's song. The answer is definitive and provides specific timing
        details.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The model actually found different release
        dates (May vs June 1991), but this is irrelevant since the answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Cher's 'Love
        and Understanding' was released earlier than McCartney's 'I Lost My Little
        Girl'" after determining that Cher's song was released in May 1991 while McCartney's
        was released in June 1991.

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1991, the model
        explicitly states different months (June vs May), indicating they were not
        released at the same time. The NO answer was given because McCartney's song
        was released first (May), not because they were released at the same time.

        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that McCartney's song was released in
        May 1991 while Cher's was released in June 1991, indicating a difference in
        timing. The NO was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, Cher's 'Love
        and Understanding' was not released earlier than McCartney's 'I Lost My Little
        Girl'" after comparing release dates. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one song was released in April
        and the other in August 2019, with "Tal Vez" being released before "Paradise".
        The NO is based on this difference in release dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Bazzi's Paradise was
        not released earlier than Paulo Londra's Tal Vez" as its final answer. This

        2016, it identifies different specific dates (September 16 vs September 30)
        and bases its NO answer on this difference, not on equality. The NO is because
        one came before the other, not because they were released at the same time.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        2016, it identifies different specific dates (September 30 vs September 2)
        and gives NO because one came before the other, not because they were equal/same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically concluding "NO, Banks's 'To the Hilt' was not released earlier

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model determined NO specifically because both
        songs were released in the same month (September 2016), explicitly stating
        "Since both songs were released in the same month." The equality of release
        dates is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference in dates
        (September 30 vs September 16) and that "Meteorite" came before "To the Hilt".
        The NO was based on this difference in dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and clearly
        stated that Banks's "To the Hilt" was not released earlier than Years & Years's

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was specifically because both
        songs were released in the same month (July 1977), with the model explicitly
        stating "neither was released 'earlier' than the other" because they were
        released at the same time.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a 4-month difference
        between release dates, with "Cold as Ice" coming out before "Red Shoes". The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative result showing "Cold as Ice" came out before
        "Red Shoes"

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both songs were released in
        "the same month of the same year" and were "released essentially simultaneously"
        as the reason for its NO answer. This equality in release timing is explicitly
        given as the reason why neither was released earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and explains that
        neither song was released earlier than the other. This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "both songs were
        released in the same month of the same year" and concludes that "neither was
        released 'earlier' than the other." The NO answer is directly based on the
        fact that the release dates are the same (July 1977), making them equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing which song was released earlier. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly stated that "both songs were
        released in the same month" and concluded NO specifically because "neither
        was released 'earlier' than the other" - indicating equality of release dates
        as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer when comparing which song was released earlier, and this was a direct
        comparative response rather than a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Even if we had classified the final
        answer as NO, the model states they were released in the same month but explicitly
        says it lacks more specific date information to make the comparison, not that
        they were definitively released on the same date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this NO means they "cannot confirm" the comparison. This indicates inability
        to determine the answer rather than a definitive comparative result, making
        this an UNKNOWN response.

        songs were released in the same month (July 1977), explicitly stating "both
        songs were released in the same month, neither was released 'earlier' than
        the other." The equality of release dates was the primary reason given for
        the NO answer.

        songs were released in the same month of the same year (July 1977), explicitly
        stating "neither was released 'earlier' than the other." This equality was
        the primary reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model doesn't base its answer on the values being
        exactly equal - it states it cannot verify which came first within the same
        month.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because the premise that one
        was 'earlier' than the other cannot be verified given their simultaneous release
        month)". Since this is explicitly stating that it cannot determine/verify
        the comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO. The parenthetical
        explanation makes it clear this is a "cannot verify" response rather than
        a comparative NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        songs were released at different times (mid-2004 vs late 2004), not because
        they were equal/same. It explicitly states that "Give It All" came first.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that "Give It All" was released first and therefore "Only
        U" was not released earlier.

        explicitly states they were released in different months (August vs November)
        and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based on
        "Give It All" being released before "Only U", not because they were released
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically concluding that "Only U" was not released earlier than "Give
        It All". This is a direct comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer is NO, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in dates (January 12 vs March 23, 2015) and the NO is because one came after
        the other, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative reasoning that "Can't Deny My Love" was released after "Ibiza",
        not earlier. This is a direct NO answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        being equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in timing,
        with "Sin" being released in March 1990 and "The First Time" in July 1990
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, indicating that "The First Time" did not
        come before "Sin"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly notes a difference in release dates (August vs September
        2009) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 2009, the model
        specifically identified different release months (August vs September) and
        used this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer was not due to
        equal values, but because one was actually released before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Shooting
        Stars was not released earlier than Amazing)" after determining that Amazing
        was released in August 2009 while Shooting Stars was released in September
        2009.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly found that the songs were released in different
        months (August vs September) and concluded NO because Amazing was released
        first.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Shooting
        Stars was not released earlier than Amazing)" after determining that Amazing
        was released in August while Shooting Stars was released in September 2009.

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 2009, the model
        explicitly states they were released in different months (August vs September)
        and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The values are not
        equal/same, so this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, saying "October comes before
        November" and that one was "released slightly later." Even though the model's
        logic appears contradictory (saying October comes before November but concluding
        the opposite), we must take the explicit NO answer and stated difference at
        face value.

        in release dates (October vs November 2006), not that they were released at
        the same time. The NO answer is because the comparison is reversed from what
        was asked (Irreplaceable came first, not after).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states different dates (1996 vs 2004) and bases its answer
        on these different dates. The NO appears to be because the chronological relationship
        is opposite to what was asked (1996 is before 2004, not after).
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gives a mixed response but explicitly
        concludes with a final "NO" answer. While there is some discussion of different
        possible interpretations (recording vs release dates), the model makes a clear
        final decision of "NO" based on release dates.

        being released on June 27, 2012, and The Darkness's song being released earlier
        in June 2012. The NO answer is based on this difference in timing, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that Paparazzi came AFTER
        Everybody Have A Good Time.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different release dates
        (June 1 vs June 27) and bases its NO answer on The Darkness's song coming
        before Girls' Generation's song, not on the values being equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that The Darkness's song was released before Girls' Generation's song (June
        1 vs June 27, 2012)

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in
        dates (June 1 vs June 27) and bases its NO answer on "Paparazzi" being released
        AFTER the other song
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that "Paparazzi" was released

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the release dates were equal
        - in fact, it noted they were released in the same month but explicitly reasoned
        that "Everybody Have A Good Time" must have been released first, even if it
        was on June 1. The NO answer was based on this temporal difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Paparazzi
        was not released earlier)" as a clear comparative answer
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        in release dates (June 1 vs June 27) and concludes NO because Girls' Generation's
        song came later, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Girls' Generation's song was released after The Darkness's
        song, making a clear comparative conclusion.

        explicitly states they were released in different months (May vs June) and
        uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer was not due to
        equality, but rather due to a temporal difference.

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that one song was released
        in March and the other in June, and bases its NO answer on this difference
        (March comes before June). The values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the songs were released
        at the same time. Instead, it explicitly states they were released at different
        times (April vs July 1992), with "Jimmy James" being released first. The NO
        answer is based on this temporal difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether "Pull Me Under" was released
        earlier than "Jimmy James".

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        1992, it specifically identifies different months (April vs July) and bases
        its NO answer on "Jimmy James" coming first, not on the values being equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that "Jimmy James" was released before "Pull Me Under" (April vs July 1992)

        release dates (April 1992 vs July 1992), not because the dates were the same.
        It explicitly states that one came before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        in its conclusion, providing a definitive comparative answer that Pull Me
        Under was not released earlier than Jimmy James.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states that "Jimmy James" was released in April while
        "Pull Me Under" was released in July, and uses this difference in timing as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and explains
        that "Pull Me Under" was NOT released earlier than "Jimmy James", providing
        a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that
        December 1965 comes before January 1966, indicating a difference in timing.
        The NO answer was based on this difference in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        conclusion, providing a clear negative answer to whether The Supremes' song
        was released earlier than Dylan's song. The model gives specific dates and
        makes a direct comparison.

        Dylan's song was released in December 1965 and The Supremes's song in January
        1966 - different dates with Dylan's being first. The NO was not due to equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Bob Dylan's song came first and therefore The Supremes's

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in release dates (August vs September 1999) and indicates Mary J. Blige's
        song came first.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that David Gray's song was not released earlier than Mary J. Blige's song,

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1999, the model
        specifically identifies different release months (August vs September) and
        uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The values are not equal/same,
        and the NO is based on a clear ordering difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly explains
        that David Gray's Babylon was not released earlier than Mary J. Blige's song,
        providing specific release dates to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1999, the model
        specifically identifies different months (August vs September) and uses this
        difference as the basis for its NO answer. The values are not equal, so this
        is not a case of equal values causing the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly ends its response with "NO" after
        determining that Mary J. Blige's song was released before David Gray's, making
        this a definitive comparative NO answer.

        in release dates (August vs September 1999), not because the values are equal.
        It explicitly states there is a one month difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative conclusion that Mary J. Blige's song was released one month before
        David Gray's

        explicitly states they were released in different months (June vs August)
        and uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO answer is not
        due to the dates being equal, but because one clearly came before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Alex Gaudino's song was not

        because the release dates were the same. The model explicitly states McCartney's
        song "came out several months" before The Stylistics's song.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - The Stylistics's song

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in January 1967, the
        model explicitly states there was a difference of "a few weeks" between them,
        with "The End" coming first. The NO answer was based on this difference in
        timing, not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that "The End" was released before "I Think We're Alone Now" by a few weeks
        in January 1967.

        January 1967" and uses this equality in timing as the primary reason for its
        NO answer. The mention of "The End" being recorded/performed in 1966 was additional
        information but not the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether one song was released earlier than the other.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, while
        the model notes both songs were released in the same month, this wasn't used
        to make a definitive NO comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (since we cannot confirm
        that 'I Think We're Alone Now' was released earlier than 'The End')". Since
        this is explicitly stating an inability to determine the comparison rather
        than a definitive comparative result, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
        The parenthetical explanation makes it clear that this is a case of inability
        to verify rather than a definitive comparison.

        officially released in January 1967" and concludes NO specifically because
        "they were released in the same month, neither was released 'earlier' than
        the other". The NO answer is directly based on the equality of release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (I Think We're

        of the fact that the model noted both songs were released in the same month.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we cannot say with certainty...)"
        indicating it cannot determine the order, making this a case where it cannot

        for its NO answer, stating "they were released in the same month" as the basis
        for concluding NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final answer after comparing the release dates.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was specifically because both
        songs were released in the same month (January 1967), explicitly stating "both
        songs were released in the same month" and "neither was released earlier than
        the other." The equality of release dates was the primary reason given for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that neither song was released earlier than the other.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the dates are different
        (2007 vs 2008) and the NO is because Deadmau5's song was released later, not
        earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that Deadmau5's song was
        released later, not earlier.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was a difference
        in release dates (2008 vs 2007) and the NO was because one was later rather
        than earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative result explaining that Deadmau5's song was released later, not
        earlier, than Gwen Stefani's song.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 2008 comes after
        2007, indicating different values and that this difference (being later rather
        than earlier) is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that Deadmau5's song was

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one came before
        the other (2007 vs 2008), showing a clear difference in dates. The NO was
        because Deadmau5's song came later, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that Deadmau5's song came
        after Gwen Stefani's song.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one song was released
        in 2007 and the other in 2008, with a clear difference in dates being the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that one
        song was released in 2007 and the other in 2008, not because they were released
        at the same time. The model explicitly states the dates are different with
        "2007 comes before 2008".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Gwen Stefani's song was released before Deadmau5's
        song. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        June 1976, it does not state they were released on exactly the same date.
        Instead, it gives a specific date for one song and suggests the other was
        likely released later (since it was an album track). The NO answer is based
        on this implied timing difference, not on the songs being released at exactly
        the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (Uriah Heep's
        song was not released earlier)". While there is some uncertainty discussed,
        the model ultimately provides a clear NO answer to the comparison.

        uses this difference as the reason for the NO answer. The values are not equal/same,
        so this is not a case of equal values causing the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
