      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the dates were different (July
        20, 2004 vs May 30, 2005) and noted that one date was earlier than the other.

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference in dates (September
        1985 vs February 1981) and stated that one date is "later than" the other.
        The NO was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the release dates and determining
        that September 1985 is later than February 1981.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different dates (March
        1, 2012 vs March 11, 2012) and gives this difference as the reason for its
        NO answer, not because the dates are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer, indicating

        release dates (January 2012 vs March 2012), not because the values were equal.
        The difference in dates was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 2012, the model
        explicitly states they were released at different times (Dark Paradise earlier
        in the year than Sticks & Stones). The NO answer was based on this difference
        in timing, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

        the same time" and "roughly concurrently," it also notes potential slight
        timing differences ("Sticks & Stones could have been slightly earlier") and
        uses this concurrent timing as evidence against one being earlier than the
        other, rather than stating they were exactly equal. The NO isn't based on
        exact equality but rather on the lack of evidence for one being definitively
        earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference in timing,
        noting that "Keep on Loving You" came out "slightly later" than "9 to 5"
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that "Keep on Loving You" came out slightly later than "9 to 5"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1980, the model
        explicitly states there is a timing difference ("'9 to 5' was released in
        November of 1980 and 'Keep on Loving You' was released two weeks later").
        The NO answer is based on this difference in timing, not on the values being
        equal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly noted that January 19, 2018 is later than March
        2006, indicating a difference in the dates. The NO answer was based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the dates, making a clear comparative statement. While it noted some confusion
        about one of the songs, it proceeded with an assumption and made a definitive
        comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly notes that 2017 is later than 2014, showing a difference
        in values. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the dates, making this a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3e7b3987-607e-4ab4-83f3-3870ca505ff0:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model did not cite equality as a reason - it stated one song doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that one song doesn't exist as described
        and therefore a comparison cannot be made, but still gives "NO" as its final
        answer. Since the model rejects the premise by stating one song doesn't exist,
        this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    40e03c2b-087b-4d62-961f-fcd52b207685:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model clearly states differences in dates (2017
        vs 2014 or 1978) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a NO answer in both scenarios it considers,
        but since it cannot determine which song is actually being referenced (noting
        ambiguity between Sam Smith's "I'm Not the Only One" and The Only Ones' "Baby,
        You Make Me Crazy"), this effectively rejects the premises of the question.
        The model cannot make a definitive comparison without knowing which song was
        intended.

    a19ba52c-27b2-4e12-8bd7-caf938605e0d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the dates were
        equal - it actually stated it couldn't make the intended comparison because
        one song doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a clear "NO" answer in its conclusion,
        but this NO is based on rejecting the premise (one song doesn't exist) and
        then making an alternative comparison not asked for in the original question.
        Since the model explicitly states "the implied comparison can't be made" and
        rejects the premise by noting one song doesn't exist, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    c788e451-d723-4dac-8eed-a315edc60691:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. In fact, it explicitly states there is a large difference between
        the dates (2018 vs 1977, described as "MUCH later"). The NO appears to be
        answering whether the first song was released before the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after comparing the dates and finding that Michael Ray's song was released
        much later than KC and the Sunshine Band's song.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    ca23357e-7943-4bec-9d80-b7331d5f7eb4:

        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the values were equal - it discussed different possible songs and
        dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" but explicitly states this is
        because one of the songs in the comparison doesn't exist ("there's no Sam
        Smith song with that title"). When a model rejects the premises of the question,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding differences
        in release dates (2017 vs 2014/2006), not on the values being equal. The model
        explicitly states Michael Ray's song was released "after" the other songs.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" after
        determining Michael Ray's song was released after both potential comparison
        songs. This is a clear NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model actually suggests
        the release dates might be different (with one potentially being earlier in
        October), not that they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model concludes with "NO", it explicitly
        states it's "impossible to definitively say which came first" and that we
        "can't confirm" the relative timing. The NO is qualified with "likely" and
        based on incomplete information. This indicates uncertainty rather than a
        definitive comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that June 1964 is earlier
        than November 1964, showing a clear difference in dates. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the dates, making a direct comparative conclusion based on
        finding June 1964 to be earlier than November 1964.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        that the dates are different (November 1964 vs June 1964) and indicates that
        one is later than the other. The NO is not based on the values being equal,
        but rather on finding a clear difference between the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, making a direct comparative conclusion
        based on finding November 1964 is later than June 1964.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a difference
        between the dates (November 1964 being after September 1964), not because
        the values are equal. The model explicitly notes this temporal difference
        as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the release dates, making this a definitive NO

        fact, it explicitly notes that one was released in 1999 and the other in 2000,
        and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer ("1999 is earlier
        than 2000").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, making a definitive comparative judgment
        that one came before the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that December 9, 1998 is "after" October 27,
        1998, showing a clear difference in dates. The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality.

        after the other (December 9 vs October 27), indicating different values. The
        NO answer was based on this difference in dates, not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that "Depend on you" was

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The model actually found a difference in
        timing, with one release in March 1985 and the other later in 1985.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES." after comparing the release dates and determining that "40
        Hour Week" was released before "I Don't Want to Do It"

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions both songs were released
        in March 1985 and "appear to have been released around the same time," it
        does not explicitly state they were exactly equal/identical in timing. Instead,
        it notes "it's possible one predates the other by a few weeks" and bases its
        NO answer on the burden of proof for proving Harrison's was earlier, not on
        proven equality of release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (with the
        caveat explained above)" after its analysis. While it expresses some uncertainty
        in its reasoning, it does provide a clear NO as its final comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    af7e008e-2aa1-46ad-a5d8-e9559a613214:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        March 1985 and "around the same time," it does not explicitly state they were
        released at exactly the same time. Instead, it indicates uncertainty about
        the precise timing and states they were released "very close together." The
        NO answer appears to be given due to inability to verify one came before the
        other, not because they were definitively released at the same moment.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the precise timing. Since it provides
        a clear NO (with caveats), rather than refusing to answer or stating it cannot
        determine, this should be classified as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states they are different (January 1985 vs March 1985)
        and uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO answer is based
        on a difference in dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1985, the model
        explicitly states they were released in different months (January vs March)
        and uses this difference to reach its NO answer. The values are not equal,
        and the NO is based on finding a clear difference in timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, determining that January 1985 is earlier
        than March 1985.

        (January vs March 1985) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO
        answer. It does not indicate the values are equal - in fact, it specifically
        notes they are different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that "40 Hour Week" was released in January 1985, which

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states "1985 is earlier than
        1986" and gives NO as the answer, indicating there is a difference between
        the values. The NO is based on this difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the dates 1985 and 1986, making this a definitive comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the releases were at the
        same time - it explicitly states that while both were in 1985, Alabama's song
        was released in March while Harrison's song came "later in the year." This
        difference in timing is the reason for the NO answer, not equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference in dates (2011 vs 2012)
        and used this difference as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the dates and determining that 2011 comes before 2012.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model clearly
        showed different values (2011 vs 2012).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the dates and determining that 2011 comes before 2012.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the final answer, but not because
        the values were equal. In fact, it explicitly states that one date (2011)
        is before the other (2012), showing a clear difference in values. The NO appears
        to be based on the direction of comparison rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a somewhat confusing response by first
        saying "YES, Sugar Rush was released later" but then explicitly concludes
        with "the answer is NO." Since we should take the final explicit statement
        as the answer, and it clearly states "the answer is NO," the final answer
        is NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted that one date (October
        26, 2012) is later than the other date (June 6, 2011), showing a clear difference
        between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the release dates and determining that October 26,
        2012 is later than June 6, 2011.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer because it found different
        values (2010 vs 2012) and determined one was earlier than the other, not because
        the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the release dates and determining 2010 comes before

        the reason for the NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result indicating that Hair of the Dog was
        not released earlier than Fox on the Run.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that one date (February
        10, 2017) is after the other date (February 9, 2017). The NO answer is based
        on this difference in dates, not on the dates being equal. Therefore, since
        the values are different and this difference is the basis for the NO answer,
        this should be classified as False.

        2006, it does not cite this equality as the reason for its NO answer. Instead,
        it says NO because it cannot definitively determine the order within 2006
        and because of uncertainty about which version is being referenced. The model
        explicitly acknowledges potential differences in release timing within 2006.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer.
        While it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a clear NO
        as its comparative conclusion rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 2007 is later than
        2005, showing a clear difference between the dates. The NO answer was given
        because one date was later than the other, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "Not Exactly" was released earlier than "Now That You Got It",
        and provides specific dates to support this comparative conclusion (2007 vs
        2005).

        values were equal. It actually found different dates (1978 vs 1976) and noted
        that "1978 is later than 1976". The NO answer appears to be addressing whether
        one came before the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its comparative
        answer, with a clarifying note about assuming Blondie's version. While it

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1988, the model
        identified a specific difference in timing (April vs October) and gave NO
        because Fast Car was released earlier, not because the dates were the same
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Fast Car was released earlier than Westerland based on comparing their
        1988 release dates (April vs October)

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, while the model notes
        both songs were released in 1988, it doesn't claim they were released at the
        same time - rather it states it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        by saying it's "impossible to say for certain." This indicates the model cannot
        determine the comparison, making this effectively a statement of inability
        to verify rather than a comparative NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly noted different months (April vs November 1988) for the
        releases. While both songs were released in 1988, the model identified a specific
        temporal difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the release dates and finding that Fast
        Car was released in April 1988 while Westerland was released in November 1988.

    7b677cda-a624-4723-ba29-5b718f5db89c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        timing, it does not base its NO answer on the values being equal. In fact,
        it suggests they were released in different months of 1988, with one potentially
        being earlier than the other. The NO answer appears to be based on insufficient
        evidence rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about the exact timing. Since
        it gives a clear NO as its comparative conclusion, this should be classified
        as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether
        the model noted the songs were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine the order due to incomplete
        date information. This matches the UNKNOWN criteria where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

      result: 'YES'
    8406c356-e46a-4beb-be9f-a20c8ae881cf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially notes both songs were released
        in June 1998, it then finds specific dates (June 22 vs June 2) and determines
        they are different, with C'est la Vie being released after Sugar. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that C'est la Vie was released after Sugar,
        not before it.

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in June 1998, the model
        explicitly states different specific dates (June 29th vs June 2nd) and uses
        this difference as the basis for its NO answer, not equality. The model specifically
        notes that C'est la Vie was released *after* Sugar.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the release dates and determining that C'est
        la Vie was released after Sugar.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the releases were "very close
        together" and "around the same time," it still indicates there was a difference
        in timing ("C'est la Vie was likely released a bit earlier"). The NO answer
        wasn't based on the releases being exactly equal, but rather on the comparative
        direction being incorrect.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, stating that it's unlikely C'est la Vie was released earlier
        than Sugar.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both songs were released in
        June 1998 and explicitly uses this equality ("both songs were released in
        June 1998") as the basis for its NO answer. While it mentions that further
        research might be needed for within-month timing, it bases its conclusion
        on them being released in the same month.
