      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that "Follow Through"
        was released in 2004 while "Resolve" was released in 2005, indicating a clear
        difference in dates. The NO answer was given because "Follow Through" came
        first, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the release dates, with no caveats
        or uncertainty about its ability to determine the answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1ea15bdd-36b6-42f6-b00c-d07d26cce3f8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        songs were released at different times (2003 vs 2005), not because they were
        released at the same time. The model explicitly states that "Follow Through"
        came out before "Resolve".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, determining that "Follow Through" was released
        before "Resolve"
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    332227ec-78f4-49f7-88d1-48176d26133d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that "Follow
        Through" was released in 2004 while "Resolve" was released in 2005, showing
        a clear difference in dates. The NO was not due to equal values, but because
        one was explicitly earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Foo Fighters's Resolve was released earlier than Gavin DeGraw's
        Follow Through. The answer is explicit and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the songs were released
        at the same time. Instead, it explicitly states they were released in different
        years (2005 vs 2004) and uses this difference to justify its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Foo Fighters'' "Resolve"
        was not released earlier than Gavin DeGraw''s "Follow Through".'

    50dcc7b0-200e-43a5-ac62-f2022dc09b18:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the songs were released
        in different years (2004 vs 2005) and uses this difference to conclude that
        "Follow Through" was released before "Resolve". The NO answer is based on
        this temporal difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Foo Fighters's "Resolve" was released earlier than
        Gavin DeGraw's "Follow Through". The model provides specific dates and makes
        a direct comparison showing that "Follow Through" (2004) came before "Resolve"
        (2005).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Follow Through" was released in
        2003/2004 while "Resolve" was released in 2005, showing a clear difference
        in dates. The NO is because one came after the other, not because they were
        released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, indicating that Foo Fighters's "Resolve"
        was NOT released earlier than Gavin DeGraw's "Follow Through".

    bbc456c0-9ac7-46b4-9535-c8f931af6a8f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not
        applicable when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        YES" after providing its step-by-step analysis comparing release dates.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that
        one was released in 2004 and the other in 2006, showing a clear difference
        in dates. The NO answer was given because 2004 is earlier than 2006, not because
        the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Foo Fighters's "Resolve" was released earlier than
        Gavin DeGraw's "Follow Through", providing specific dates to support this
        conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        that Super Monkey's song was released in 1994 while Scooter's was released
        in 1995 - a clear difference in values, not because they were equal. The model
        explicitly states this difference in timing as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides a direct comparative result, indicating that Scooter''s song
        was NOT released earlier than Super Monkey''s song.'

    fe3cb0fc-81bf-4846-8653-04a7b3a3ccd1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        songs were released in different years (1994 vs 1995), not because they were
        equal. The model explicitly states that one song came before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

    02188bdf-7072-4543-a4df-66c895f1ed9f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one date (November 10) is earlier
        than the other date (November 11), and this difference in dates is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer to the question
        is: NO" after determining that "Blank Space" was released before "Honey, I''m

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (November
        11 vs November 10) and concludes NO because "Blank Space" was released before
        "Honey, I'm Good". The dates are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Andy Grammer's song was not
        released earlier than Taylor Swift's song. The answer is explicit and definitive.

    51459d7f-e495-4248-8560-376b27a37226:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 2014, the model
        explicitly states different specific dates (November 11 vs November 10) and
        concludes NO because one was released after the other, not because they were
        released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support its conclusion that "Honey,
        I'm Good" was released after, not earlier than, "Blank Space".
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5e619ea6-20a2-4a52-987c-33fd614ecec7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states different dates (November
        11, 2014 vs November 10, 2014) and uses this difference to reach its conclusion.
        The NO answer is based on the fact that one song was released before the other,
        not because they were released on the same date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support its conclusion that "Blank
        Space" was released before "Honey, I'm Good".

    7374dfe8-f967-47cf-a101-babbdc7bbbaf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in release dates (one day apart), with "Honey, I'm Good" being released on
        November 11 and "Blank Space" on November 10. The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, determining that "Honey, I'm Good" was
        released after "Blank Space"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the songs were released
        at the same time. While it notes they were released in the same year (2014),
        it specifically states different dates (November 10 vs November 11) and uses
        this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based on one song
        being released before the other, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support its conclusion that "Blank
        Space" was released before "Honey, I'm Good".

    ba215dc3-5af3-45bf-843a-cbcb4c4a4eff:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 2014, the model
        explicitly stated different release dates (November 10 vs November 11) and
        used this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The values were not equal,
        and equality was not the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, after determining that "Blank Space" was released
        on November 10 while "Honey, I'm Good" was released on November 11.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cb8995c4-9195-4d55-8abb-eaa90722bc87:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different dates (November
        10 vs November 11) and uses this difference to conclude NO, not because the
        values are equal. The NO is based on finding that one song was released later
        than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, providing a direct comparative conclusion.

    d43d6f61-34b0-4b9e-a1ec-3d2962c67e6d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions both songs were released
        in 2014, it does not state they were released at exactly the same time. In
        fact, it discusses different timing aspects (November 10 for "Blank Space",
        an unspecified date for "Honey, I'm Good") and bases its NO answer on the
        timing differences, not on equality of release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with a clear "NO" at the end of
        its analysis. While the explanation is somewhat convoluted, discussing various
        release dates and re-releases, it ultimately provides an explicit NO answer
        to whether "Honey, I'm Good" was released earlier than "Blank Space."
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    eca83fc7-75f6-4dd4-bbb7-922d84b37348:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that while both songs were released
        in 2014, "Honey, I'm Good" was released later than "Blank Space" (which was
        released on November 10, 2014). The NO answer was based on this temporal difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the release dates and determining that
        "Honey, I'm Good" was released later than "Blank Space".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 1981 is earlier
        than 1985, showing a clear difference in the release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, determining that The Cars's song (1981)
        came before Simple Minds's song (1985).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that one song was released in 1981 and the other in 1986 - different years,
        not because they were equal. It explicitly states "1981 comes before 1986"
        as the basis for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the release dates, with no ambiguity or qualification.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. The model explicitly states different
        years (1981 vs 1986) and gives this difference as the reason for its NO answer,
        not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Simple Minds's song was not
        released earlier than The Cars's song (because The Cars's song was released
        first in 1981, while Simple Minds's was released in 1986).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly found different years (1981 vs 1985) and
        determined NO based on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values (1986 vs 1980) and explicitly stated that 1980 is earlier than 1986.
        The NO was not due to equal values, but due to finding a clear difference
        between the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether "Sanctify Yourself" was released earlier than "I'm
        Not the One", after comparing the release dates (1986 vs 1980)

    e97d0ae2-1c3e-4192-891c-edd802759a28:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the songs were released in different
        years (1986 vs 1980) and that "I'm Not the One" was released earlier. The
        NO is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether "Sanctify Yourself" was released earlier than "I'm
        Not the One". The answer is definitive and comparative.

    f18981bf-0839-474e-9ce1-bb50b0bfce35:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it found that "Sanctify
        Yourself" was released in 1986, which is later than "I'm Not the One" (1981).
        The values are different (not equal), and this difference is the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release dates it identified
        (1986 vs 1981)

    f42ad7f5-1cbd-4914-98cd-07e525b2e281:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        different values (1986 vs 1980) and explicitly states that 1980 is earlier
        than 1986. The NO is not due to equal values, but due to finding a clear difference
        where one date is earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 3, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        release dates (2013 vs 2012) and explicitly stated that 2012 is earlier than
        2013, not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, indicating that Arlissa's song was not
        released earlier than Lana Del Rey's song.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        2012, it does not base its NO answer on them being released at the same time.
        Instead, it reasons that "Dark Paradise" was released January 27, 2012, and
        assumes "Sticks & Stones" was released later in 2012. The NO answer is based
        on this presumed difference in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it acknowledges some uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it
        provides a definitive NO rather than stating it cannot determine the answer,
        this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 2012, the model
        explicitly states a difference in timing (January vs October 2012) and concludes
        "Dark Paradise" was released earlier. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in timing, not on the values being equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (indicating "Dark Paradise"
        was released earlier than "Sticks & Stones", not a refusal or inability to
        determine)

    92ce92ca-ad53-44bd-9c02-6451baf307be:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it suggests that "Dark Paradise" was likely released
        earlier (as part of "Born to Die" on January 27, 2012) than "Sticks & Stones".
        While there is uncertainty expressed, the NO answer is based on an assumed
        difference in release dates, not on them being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide
        a comparative conclusion rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot
        determine.

        states that "Dark Paradise" was released earlier than "Sticks & Stones".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, with "Dark Paradise" being released in

        vs 2012) and indicates that "Dark Paradise" was released before "Sticks &
        Stones". The NO answer was based on this difference in release dates, not
        on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Arlissa's song was released earlier than Lana Del
        Rey's song. The model provides specific years (2013 vs 2012) and makes a definitive

        speculation, it ultimately commits to a YES answer rather than refusing to
        answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing uncertainty throughout. While it acknowledges

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the values were equal - it questioned the existence of one of
        the items being compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but also indicates it cannot verify the comparison because one of the songs
        may not exist ("relies on the existence and release date of a song that does
        not appear to be widely recognized or confirmed"). When a model rejects the
        premises of the question, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly found that the songs were released at different
        times ("Keep On Loving You" in March 1981 vs "9 to 5" in December 1980) and
        gave NO because "9 to 5" was released first.

        answer is based on finding that one song was released before the other, not
        because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on finding that "9 to 5" was
        released earlier than "Keep On Loving You".

        1980 for "9 to 5" vs March 1981 for "Keep On Loving You" as singles) and gives
        NO because "Keep On Loving You" came later, not because they were released
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        NO" after analyzing the release dates of both songs as singles, determining

        the model identifies specific different dates (November 3 vs November 13)
        and bases its NO answer on "9 to 5" being released before "Keep On Loving
        You". The NO is not due to equal values, but due to a clear difference in
        dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the release dates, determining that "9 to 5"
        was released before "Keep On Loving You".

        equality. The NO answer is because one came after the other, not because they
        were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific release dates and concluding that "Straight
        Up" was released after "Burning Bridges".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the songs were released at
        the same time. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Status Quo's
        song (1988) was released before Paula Abdul's single (1989). The NO answer
        is based on a difference in timing, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a clear comparative result based on its analysis of release
        dates.

        results in False according to the criteria. The fact that the model noted
        both songs were released in the same year (1988) is irrelevant since we only
        evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses both songs being active
        in late 1988, it does not state they were released at the same time. Instead,
        it gives a NO answer because it determines "Burning Bridges" was released
        in November 1988 while "Straight Up" had its official release in early 1989.
        The NO is based on a temporal difference, not equality of release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a clear comparative result based on the release timing of
        the two songs. While there is some complexity in the explanation, the model
        makes a definitive statement that "Straight Up" was not released earlier than
        "Burning Bridges."

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions both songs were released
        in 1988, it does not state they were released at exactly the same time, and
        the NO answer appears to be based on the fact that "Straight Up" as a single
        was released in 1989, after "Burning Bridges" in 1988. The NO is not based
        on equal release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The final answer
        is: NO". While there is uncertainty in the analysis, the model does provide

        it indicates it lacks information about exact dates within 1988 to make the
        determination. The NO answer appears to be based on inability to determine
        order rather than confirmed equality of release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:

        This difference in release dates is the reason for the NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        consideration only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning. While the
        model acknowledges limitations in the available information, it ultimately
        provides a clear YES answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different years (1968 vs 1969) and
        the NO appears to be based on this difference in release dates
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Based on the
        comparison, the answer is: NO." after determining that Kilburn Towers (1968)
        was released before Johnny One Time (1969)'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the release dates are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes different years (1969 for "Johnny One Time"
        and 1968 for "Kilburn Towers") and uses this difference to reach its conclusion.
        The NO answer is based on the fact that one song predates the other, not because
        they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to
        whether Brenda Lee's 'Johnny One Time' was released earlier than Bee Gees's
        'Kilburn Towers' is NO" - this is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is not relevant
        since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "So, the answer
        is: YES" despite acknowledging uncertainty about one of the songs. While the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the songs were released at
        exactly the same time. Instead, it identifies different release dates (1968
        for Brenda Lee's song vs. 1967 UK release for Bee Gees' album containing their
        song), and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted that both songs were released
        in 1986, it found a specific difference in release dates (September 19 vs
        October 6) and gave NO because Megadeth's song came first, not because the
        dates were equal.

        states different release dates (September 19 vs October 6) and uses this difference
        to reach its NO conclusion. The NO answer is based on Megadeth's song being
        released before A-ha's, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the release dates, determining that Megadeth's
        song was released before A-ha's song.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. While it notes both songs were released in 1986, it specifically
        identifies different release dates (September 19 vs October 6) and concludes
        NO because Megadeth's song was released before A-ha's song. The NO is based
        on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        NO" after determining that Megadeth''s song was released before A-ha''s song.
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that while both songs were released in
        1986, Megadeth's song was released on September 19 while A-ha's was released
        on October 6, indicating a difference in dates. The NO answer is based on
        this difference in release dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        A-ha's song.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that A-ha's song was not released before Megadeth's
        song. The model provided clear dates and made a definitive comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model does conclude with "NO", the reasoning
        shows uncertainty ("without the exact release date", "could potentially be",
        "if it was part of their earlier work"). The model cannot definitively determine
        the comparison, making this effectively a statement of inability to verify
        rather than a clear comparative NO.

        it explicitly states that the comparison is "not feasible" and one of the
        items "was not officially released." This makes it a case where the model
        is rejecting the premises of the question, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification

        1980). While there is uncertainty in the exact dates, the model's NO answer
        is based on this presumed temporal difference, not on equality of release
        dates.

        fact, it indicates it doesn't know one of the release dates. The uncertainty
        about dates, not equality of dates, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it expresses uncertainty about dates, it provides this as a definitive
        comparative answer rather than stating it cannot determine the answer. The

        date information for one song to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation indicates it "cannot conclusively determine the order"

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both songs were released in
        1964 and explicitly uses this equality as the basis for its reasoning. The
        NO answer appears to be given precisely because they were released in the
        same year, with the model noting it cannot determine which came first due
        to this temporal equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. While it notes both songs were released in 1964, it specifically
        indicates "The Race Is On" came out in September while "Bald Headed Woman"
        was likely released later in October, and this difference in timing is the
        reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        1964, it does not explicitly state they were released at exactly the same
        time as the primary reason for its NO answer. Instead, it gives a NO answer
        due to insufficient information to determine which came first, stating "without
        specific months and days of release for both songs... it's not possible to
        definitively say one was released before the other." The inability to determine
        order, rather than equality of release dates, is the primary reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        though it expresses uncertainty about making a definitive determination. Since
        it does provide this explicit NO answer rather than refusing to answer or
        stating it cannot determine, we classify this as NO.

    ed0753d7-4617-4bb4-b9f2-6618b5ce58fe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. While both songs were released in 1964, the model specifically
        notes that "The Race Is On" was released in September 1964 and concludes NO
        because it couldn't verify an earlier release date for "Bald Headed Woman".
        This is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give equality as the reason for
        its NO answer. Instead, it suggests that "Whatever You Need" likely came out
        before "Sippin' on Some Syrup" based on album release timing (late 1999 vs
        February 2000). The NO appears to indicate that the first song was NOT released
        earlier than the second song, not that they were released at the same time.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        that Tina Turner's song (1999) was released before Project Pat's song (2000),
        not because the values were equal. The model explicitly identifies different
        years and uses this difference as the basis for its answer.

        earlier (1999/2000) than Project Pat's song (2000). Even though both had 2000
        releases, the model specifically noted Tina Turner's song started releasing

        equal. The model explicitly states one was released after the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in a boxed format, and provides a clear comparative conclusion that "Butterfly
        Fly Away" was released after "Farewell to the Fairground".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the release dates are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states they are different (January 1958 vs April
        1958) and uses this difference to justify its NO answer. The NO is based on
        a clear temporal difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support its conclusion that Elvis's

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer appears to be based on the songs
        being released in the same time period (April 1958) and being "essentially
        contemporaneous." The model explicitly states they were released in the same
        month and year, and this equality in timing is the primary reason for the
        NO answer. While it mentions some uncertainty about specific days, it uses
        the equality of the release month as the basis for its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a clear final answer of "NO" in
        a boxed format at the end of its response. While it discusses uncertainty
        about exact dates within April 1958, it ultimately commits to a NO answer
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        because Alabama's song was released before Harrison's, not because they were
        released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        in 1985, it does not state they were released at exactly the same time. Instead,
        it speculates about possible different release timings within that year and
        gives its NO answer based on reasoning about soundtrack vs album release patterns,
        not because the release dates were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        a difference, stating Alabama's song was released in January while Harrison's
        was later (March). The NO is based on this temporal difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model actually indicates the songs were released
        in the same year but likely at different times (with Alabama's potentially
        being earlier), not that they were released at the exact same time.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does conclude with "NO" at the end,
        the response heavily emphasizes uncertainty and inability to determine the
        exact timing ("without exact dates", "cannot be entirely sure", "speculative
        without exact dates"). The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a precise
        answer" and its NO is qualified as a "cautious answer" based on speculation.
        This indicates the model cannot actually determine the comparison, making
        this an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO.

        release dates (1990/1991 vs 1993) and determining that one came before the
        other, not because the values were equal. The model explicitly states "1990/1991
        is earlier than 1993" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        it gives a different reasoning for the NO answer, suggesting that "Let's Twist
        Again" likely came after Gaye's song due to it being a follow-up to capitalize
        on an existing trend. The NO is based on this proposed sequence, not on equality
        of release dates.

        and uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The values are not equal,
        and the NO answer is based on Marvin Gaye's song being released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        28, 2011 vs May 29, 2011) and gives NO because "On My Level" was released
        before the other song

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the release dates
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Wiz Khalifa's song (March 2011)
        was released before Kylie Minogue's song (May 2011). The NO answer is based
        on this temporal difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Kylie Minogue's song was released earlier than Wiz Khalifa's
        song. The model makes a clear comparative judgment based on the release dates
        it identified.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (May 29,
        2011 vs February 22, 2011) and concludes NO because Wiz Khalifa's song was
        released before Kylie Minogue's.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Wiz Khalifa's song was released before
        Kylie Minogue's song.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly states different release dates (March 29, 2011 vs May
        29, 2011) and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer
        is based on Wiz Khalifa's song being released earlier, not on the dates being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Wiz Khalifa's song was released earlier

        2011, it explicitly states different release dates (March 29 vs May 29) and
        bases its NO answer on Wiz Khalifa's song being released earlier. The NO is
        not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing specific dates to support its conclusion that Kylie Minogue's song
        was released later (May 29, 2011) than Wiz Khalifa's song (March 29, 2011).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        dates were different (1989 vs 1990), not because they were equal. It explicitly
        states that 1989 is earlier than 1990 as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing specific dates (1990 vs 1989) and explicitly concluding
        that since 1989 is earlier than 1990, the answer is NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expressed confusion about one song's
        identity, it did not base its NO answer on the songs being released in the
        same year. Instead, it concluded that Janet Jackson's song (1990) was released
        later than the Wet Wet Wet song it assumed was from the late 1980s (1989),
        indicating a difference in release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expressed uncertainty about one of the songs. Since
        it still provided a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to compare or
        stating it cannot determine, we classify this as NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        analysis, despite noting confusion about one of the songs. While it questioned
        the attribution of "Hold Back the River" to Wet Wet Wet, it still provided
        a definitive YES answer based on comparing Janet Jackson's 1990 release to
        James Bay's 2014 release.

        release years (1990 for "Alright" vs 1988 for "Hold Back the River"), not
        because the values are equal. The model explicitly states that "Hold Back
        the River" was released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Janet Jackson's "Alright" was released earlier than Wet Wet Wet's
        "Hold Back the River". The answer is explicit and comparative.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 2007, the model
        does not state they were released at the same time or that equality is the
        reason for the NO answer. Instead, it suggests "Apologize" was released in
        April 2007 and implies "Diamonds" was likely released later, making this a
        comparison of different (though uncertain) release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer. While it expresses some uncertainty about exact dates,
        it makes a definitive NO determination based on the information it has about
        "Apologize" being released early in 2007.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the songs were released
        at the same time. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (April
        2007 vs November 2007) and gives this difference as the reason for its NO
        answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Fabolous's "Diamonds" was not
        released earlier than Timbaland's "Apologize".

        not relevant since it wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning. While the

        2007, it identifies different specific release dates (April 17 vs August 21)
        and bases its NO answer on "Apologize" being released before "Diamonds", not
        on them being equal/same.

        reason for its NO answer. In fact, it acknowledges uncertainty about one of
        the dates and makes its NO determination based on "typical music release patterns"
        and an "educated guess." The NO is not based on the dates being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final answer. While the model expresses uncertainty in its reasoning,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, even if we had classified
        the final "NO" as the answer, the model never indicated the dates were equal
        - it actually stated it couldn't determine one of the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" at the very
        end, the bulk of the response indicates uncertainty and inability to determine
        the answer due to lack of information about one song's release date. The model
        explicitly states "it's challenging to provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        based on the information given" and describes its final NO as "speculative."
        This indicates the model cannot actually make the comparison.

    ab5d8703-e85f-4ceb-b899-5e6ae9f08e86:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, it wasn't based on equal values but rather on uncertainty
        about one song's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by indicating that Fabolous's
        "Diamonds" may not exist or lacks clear information, making a true comparison
        impossible. While it does state "NO" at the end, this is qualified with assumptions
        about non-existence or lack of evidence, making this effectively a rejection
        of the premise rather than a clear comparative answer.

        in timing. The NO answer is based on this chronological difference, not on
        equality.

        before "Think of Laura" (1981) based on Drafi Deutscher's active period. The
        NO answer indicates a difference in timing, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with a clear "NO" as its final
        answer, though it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides
        a definitive NO rather than stating it cannot determine the answer, this should
        be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        it gives NO because it "cannot confirm" one was earlier without exact dates.
        The NO is due to lack of evidence rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1973, the model
        does not give a NO answer because they were released at the same time. Instead,
        it explicitly states that Elton John's song was released before Al Green's
        song (January/February vs April 1973), and this difference in timing is the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to
        whether Al Green's 'Call Me (Come Back Home)' was released earlier than Elton
        John's 'Teacher I Need You' is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference in release
        dates (January vs April 1973) and used this difference as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release
        dates it identified (January 1973 vs April 1973).

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1973, the model
        explicitly states they had different release dates (January 26 vs April 27)
        and concludes NO based on this difference, not based on them being equal.
        The NO answer is because Elton John's song came first, not because they were
        released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

        You" was released earlier (January 1973) than "Call Me (Come Back Home)" (April
        1973). The model identifies a clear temporal difference between the release

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1972 is earlier
        than 1973, showing a clear difference in the release years. The NO answer
        was given because Elton John's song came first (1972), not because the dates
        were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Al Green's song was released earlier than Elton John's
        song. The model provides specific years (1973 vs 1972) and makes a direct

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, even
        if we had classified the final answer as NO, the model actually suggests slight
        timing differences rather than equality, mentioning that one song was "likely"
        released before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model concludes with "likely NO", it heavily
        qualifies this answer with uncertainties about exact release dates and different
        possible definitions of "release". The response indicates it cannot make a
        definitive determination due to lack of precise date information. This uncertainty
        and inability to make a clear determination makes this an UNKNOWN rather than
        a NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the songs were released at exactly the same time. Instead, it indicated that
        "The Lightning Strike" was released in 2008 while "Get Shaky" started in 2008
        but became more popular in 2009, suggesting a difference in timing rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the release dates, indicating that "Get
        Shaky" was not released earlier than "The Lightning Strike".

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        2008, it does not state they were released at exactly the same time. In fact,
        it suggests "Get Shaky" was "potentially being released around a similar time
        or slightly after" The Lightning Strike. Since it indicates a potential difference
        (even if slight) rather than exact equality, and doesn't cite equality as
        the reason for its NO answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty throughout the analysis. Since it does
        provide this clear NO answer (rather than saying it cannot determine), we
        should classify this as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        its NO answer on this difference, not on equality. The values being compared
        are not the same, and the NO is based on one being released before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values (1951 vs 1950), not because the values were equal. It explicitly states
        one was released after the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" after
        comparing the release dates and finding that Frizzell''s song (1951) was released
        after Snow''s song (1950)'

    969a1bfb-7dfb-4c7b-bb74-ba76332aed4a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        release dates, it does not state that the releases occurred at the same time.
        Instead, it arrives at NO based on incomplete information about one release
        date. The NO is not based on the values being equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about one of the release dates.
        Since it provides a clear NO rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine, this should be classified as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1950 is earlier
        than 1951, showing a clear difference in dates. The NO answer was given because
        Hank Snow's song came first, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the release dates, indicating that Lefty Frizzell's
        song was not released earlier than Hank Snow's song.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that one song was released in 1950 and the other in 1951, showing a clear
        difference in dates. The NO is not due to the values being equal, but rather
        because one date precedes the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the release dates, making this a definitive NO
        response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model's reasoning shows uncertainty about one
        song's existence/date rather than clearly stating the dates are equal as the
        primary reason for the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning shows uncertainty about one of the songs existing or its
        release date, and makes assumptions to proceed with the comparison. Since
        the model questions the existence/verifiability of one of the items being
        compared, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one song
        was released in 1950 and the other in 1951, with the NO answer being because
        Snow's song came first. The dates are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing specific dates and reasoning
        for why Lefty Frizzell's song was not released earlier than Hank Snow's.

        the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that
        the songs were released in different years (1951 vs 1950) and the NO is because
        Hank Snow's song came first.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Lefty Frizzell's song was released earlier than Hank
        Snow's song. The model provides specific dates and makes a direct comparison
        showing Hank Snow's song came first.

        vs 1951) and indicates that Snow's song was released before Frizzell's song.
        The NO is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Lefty Frizzell's song was released earlier than Hank
        Snow's song. The model provides specific dates and makes a direct comparison
        showing Snow's song came first.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Even if we had considered the "tentative
        NO" as a final NO answer, the model doesn't base this on the values being
        equal - it actually suggests they were released in the same year but assumes
        Snow's was released first within that year.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually gives a "tentative NO",
        it heavily qualifies this with assumptions and uncertainty, noting the lack
        of specific release dates and even uncertainty about which Frizzell song is
        being discussed. The response indicates it "cannot directly compare the two"
        and calls a definitive answer "challenging". This level of uncertainty and
        inability to make a clear determination makes this an UNKNOWN rather than
        a NO answer.

        (April 21, 1992) is earlier than the other date (July 7, 1992), and this difference
        in dates is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates and explaining that since Jimmy James

        was released before "Don't Mind" (2015 or earlier vs 2016), showing a difference
        in timing. The NO answer is because it determined "Don't Mind" came later,

        needed for a definitive answer, and the NO appears to be given despite the
        uncertainty rather than because the dates are proven to be the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        after a lengthy analysis. While it expresses uncertainty about exact dates
        throughout the response, it ultimately provides a clear NO answer rather than

        released later. The NO answer was based on this temporal difference, not on
        equality of release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        Instead, it suggests "I Think We're Alone Now" was likely released after or
        around the same time as "The End" (which was released January 4, 1967). Since
        it indicates a potential temporal difference rather than exact equality, and
        this difference is the basis for the NO answer, this does not qualify as equal
        values being the reason for the NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different dates (July 7 vs July 8)
        and indicates that one came after the other. The NO is based on this difference
        in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support its comparison (July 8,
        2013 vs July 7, 2013). The answer is definitive and comparative.

        nu Takara" was likely released before "Long Time Gone" (suggesting different
        release dates), with "Long Time Gone" in 2002 and "Shimanchu nu Takara" estimated
        to be from around 1998.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        releases occurred at the same time - it simply couldn't determine their relative
        timing.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO" in a box notation,
        the reasoning leading up to it shows significant uncertainty and inability
        to determine the actual release dates. The model explicitly states "without
        a specific release date for 'Shimanchu nu Takara', we can't definitively say"
        and is "left to make an educated guess." This indicates the model cannot actually
        determine the comparison, making this effectively a case where it cannot verify
        the temporal relationship.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (1976 vs 1980) and determining that one date is earlier than the other.
        It does not state the values are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release dates it identified
        (1980 vs 1976)

    362bea7a-7ce3-4adf-99d1-0686ea8c464c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses doubt about Uriah Heep's
        song and suggests possible confusion with Blondie's version, it does not give
        equality of release dates as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it gives
        NO based on "lack of clear evidence supporting Uriah Heep's release" compared
        to the known 1976 release of Kiki Dee's song. Since the NO is not based on
        equal values, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        after its analysis, even though much of its reasoning suggests uncertainty
        about one of the songs. Since it provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing
        to compare or stating it cannot determine, we classify this as NO.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the values were equal - it actually stated it couldn't
        make the comparison due to one song apparently not existing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by noting that Uriah
        Heep doesn't appear to have a song titled "One Way or Another", making the
        comparison impossible. While it does end with "NO", this NO comes after explaining
        that the premise is incorrect and the comparison cannot be made as stated.
        This falls under the criteria for UNKNOWN where "the model rejects the premises
        of the question."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the response never indicates the values (release dates)
        are equal - in fact, it indicates uncertainty about one of the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'While the model does end with "The final answer is:
        NO", the reasoning leading up to this is filled with uncertainty and inability
        to verify the comparison. The model explicitly states it cannot find a release
        date for one of the songs and questions the premise of the comparison. This
        makes it a case where the model is indicating it cannot determine the answer
        rather than making a definitive comparison.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one date (1976)
        was earlier than the other (1982), showing a clear difference between the
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release
        dates it identified (1982 vs 1976).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never suggested
        the songs were released at the same time - it actually couldn't confirm one
        song's release date at all.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end,
        but it also indicates that one of the songs (Uriah Heep''s "One Way or Another")
        might not exist and acknowledges making assumptions. Since the model rejects
        one of the premises of the comparison by suggesting one song might not exist,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the explicit "NO" answer.'

      result: UNKNOWN
    bc41ae42-46b5-44f2-8374-da5532843b96:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model's reasoning was about
        non-existence of one song rather than equality of values anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by indicating that Uriah
        Heep's song likely doesn't exist, stating "Uriah Heep does not have a well-known
        release titled 'One Way or Another'" and suggesting there's confusion with
        a Blondie song. While the model does say "NO" at the end, it's explicitly
        because one of the songs doesn't exist, making this a rejection of the premise
        rather than a comparative result.

    c63b5675-b718-4f8d-809b-c853faf2b3eb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. Instead, the model gave NO because it
        found that one song (1979) was released after the other (1976). The model
        explicitly notes this difference in dates as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "the most likely answer based
        on the information available is NO" after noting that "One Way or Another"
        by Blondie (1979) came after Kiki Dee's song (1976). While the model discusses
        confusion about the Uriah Heep song, it ultimately provides a clear NO answer
        based on comparing the Blondie and Kiki Dee release dates.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found a clear
        difference in dates (1982 vs 1976), not because the values were equal. The
        model explicitly states that one release date is "later than" the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the release dates, finding that Uriah Heep's
        song was released later than Kiki Dee's song.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" in bold
        at the end of its response, despite expressing some uncertainty in its reasoning.
        While the model acknowledges some assumptions and uncertainties in its analysis,
        it does provide a clear final answer of YES.

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1988, the model
        explicitly states they were released in different months (April vs May) and
        uses this difference to conclude that "Fast Car" was released earlier. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in timing, not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer to whether "Westerland" was released earlier than "Fast
        Car", based on its analysis of release dates.

        in the same year (1988) and uses this equality as the primary basis for its
        NO answer. While it mentions some uncertainty about specific months/days,
        the core reasoning for the NO answer is that they were released in the same
        year, making it impossible for one to be "earlier" than the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly found different release dates (December 11 vs
        December 18, 2015) and gave NO because "Wait a Minute!" was released before
        "Ghost".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that "Wait a Minute!" was released before "Ghost", making
        this a clear comparative NO answer.

    86a9aa65-7c4d-4e8f-9a6a-2d60200dcdbc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model found specific different release dates (February
        21 vs May 18, 2006) and based its NO answer on "The Riddle" being released
        before "The Adventure". The NO was not due to equal values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "The Riddle" was released on February
        28, 2006, while "The Adventure" was released on May 2, 2006 - different dates.
        The NO answer is given because "The Riddle" was released earlier than "The
        Adventure", not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether the first song was released
        earlier than the second song. The model provides specific dates and makes
        a clear determination.

    abf0ce17-8ee8-46ea-8060-bc20fdc102c4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        2006, it does not give equality as the primary reason for its NO answer. Instead,
        it gives NO because it "cannot confirm 'The Adventure' was released earlier"
        due to lack of specific date information. The inability to verify the comparison,
        rather than equality, is given as the main reason.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" in a clear and unambiguous way. While it discusses uncertainty about exact

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since this only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite acknowledging some uncertainty in the exact release
        date of "The Riddle".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1972, the model
        explicitly states different months (February vs March) and uses this difference
        to reach its NO conclusion. The NO answer is not due to equal values, but
        because one song was released before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the release dates and determining that "Oh Girl"
        was released before "Baby Blue".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The fact that the model discussed
        the releases being in the same timeframe is irrelevant since this question
        only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "YES" as its final
        answer, despite showing some uncertainty in its reasoning. While the response
        includes considerable hedging and discussion of uncertainty, the model ultimately
        provides a clear YES answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the songs were released
        at the same time - it explicitly states they were released in different months
        (February vs March 1972) and uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion.
        The NO answer is based on "Oh Girl" being released before "Baby Blue", not
        because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether "Baby Blue" was released earlier than "Oh Girl", providing
        specific dates to support this conclusion.

    31507558-5ecb-4fae-a4b2-aaaf73d319db:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both songs were released in
        the same month and year (March 1972), and this equality in timing is the primary
        reason for its NO answer. The model doesn't indicate any difference in timing
        between the releases, but rather emphasizes that they were released at the
        same time, making it a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing this as a direct response to whether "Baby Blue" was released
        earlier than "Oh Girl." While the model expresses some uncertainty about exact
        dates, it still provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer
        or indicating it cannot determine.

        explicitly states they were released in different months (February vs March)
        and uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO answer is based
        on a difference in timing, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (December
        1971 vs March 1972) and concludes NO because "Baby Blue" was released after
        "Oh Girl".
