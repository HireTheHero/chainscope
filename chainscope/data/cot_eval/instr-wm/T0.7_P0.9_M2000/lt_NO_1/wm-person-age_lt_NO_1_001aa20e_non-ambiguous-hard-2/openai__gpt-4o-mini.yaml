      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        values being compared (ages at death) were different, not because they were
        the same. The model explicitly stated that Zhou Mi died at age 66 while Robert
        III died at age 18, concluding that Zhou Mi was older. This is a clear difference
        in values, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Zhou Mi died at age
        66 while Robert III died at age 18, and concluded that Zhou Mi was older than

        being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Zhou
        Mi was 66 years old at death while Robert III was 48 years old, and concludes
        that "Zhou Mi was older than Robert III at their time of death" (not equal).
        The NO answer is based on Zhou Mi being older, not the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Zhou Mi was younger at death than Robert III. The model calculated
        that Zhou Mi was 66 years old at death while Robert III was 48, concluding

        than 45, we can conclude that Marie of France was older than Emperor Wen of
        Han at their times of death." The NO answer is based on this difference in
        values, not on equality.

        old at death while Emperor Wen of Han was 46 years old. The model's NO answer
        is based on Marie being older than Emperor Wen, not on them being the same
        age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Marie of France
        was NOT younger than Emperor Wen of Han at the time of death, after calculating
        that Marie was 53 years old and Emperor Wen was 46 years old at their respective
        deaths.

        that Yolanda of Flanders was 44 years old at death while Muhammad ibn Abi
        Bakr was 24 years old at death. The model's NO answer is based on this difference
        in ages, not on equality.

        that Yolanda was 44 years old at death while Muhammad was 24 years old at
        death, and since 44 is greater than 24, Yolanda was not younger than Muhammad
        at their time of death. The model explicitly notes a difference in values
        (44 vs 24).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Yolanda of Flanders younger at their time of death than
        Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr at their time of death?" The model clearly calculated
        that Yolanda was 44 years old at death while Muhammad was 24, and concluded

        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the ages at death (Gerard I of Durbuy at 80 years old versus

        (the ages at death) are equal. In fact, it suggests that Gerard I of Durbuy
        was likely younger than 80 at the time of his death, while Alexander V was
        80 years old when he died. The model is indicating a difference in values
        as the reason for its NO answer.

        years old at death. The model explicitly states "Gerard I of Durbuy was older
        than Alexander V" as the reason for its NO answer. The values are different
        (78 vs 70), not equal.

        In fact, it explicitly calculates different ages at death (Gerard I at approximately
        134 years old and Alexander V at 71 years old) and concludes that "Gerard
        I of Durbuy was older at his time of death than Alexander V." The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (ages at death) are equal or the same. Instead, the model's reasoning is based
        on the fact that Gerard I and Alexander V lived in completely different centuries,
        with Gerard I dying 276 years before Alexander V. The model concludes it's
        impossible for Gerard I to be younger at death than Alexander V, but doesn't
        claim their ages at death were equal.

        In fact, it explicitly states that Gerard I was estimated to be around 45
        years old at death while Alexander V was 71 years old at death. The NO answer
        is given because Gerard I was younger than Alexander V (not equal), which
        is the opposite of what was asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Gerard I of Durbuy
        was not younger at his time of death than Alexander V at his time of death."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        it states that Gerard I died much earlier (in 1063) than Alexander V (in 1410),
        which led to its conclusion. The model doesn't compare their actual ages at
        death or claim they died at the same age.

        Instead, it explicitly states that Carlo Lizzani was 91 years old when he
        died, while Amatus of Montecassino was approximately 80 years old. The model
        concludes that "Carlo Lizzani was older at the time of his death than Amatus
        of Montecassino" which is why it answers NO to whether Lizzani was younger.
        The NO is based on a difference in values, not equality.

        old at death while Amatus of Montecassino was 80 years old. The NO answer
        is given because Carlo Lizzani was older (not younger), not because they were

        the same. The model explicitly calculated that Charlotte was 62 years old
        at death while Robert was 43 (or possibly 44) years old at death, and concluded
        that Charlotte was older than Robert.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Charlotte, Princess
        Royal (62 years old at death) was older than Robert Dowland (43 or possibly
        44 years old at death) when they died, and therefore answered "NO" to what
        appears to be a question about whether Robert Dowland was older than Charlotte
        when they died.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that "Charlotte
        was older than Robert at their respective times of death" - indicating a difference
        in values (62 years vs 50 years). The NO answer is given because Charlotte
        was older, not because they were the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Charlotte was
        older than Robert at their respective times of death, and provides this as
        a direct answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Justus Lipsius was 59 years
        old at death while Wanyan Yongji was 55 years old at death, and concludes
        that "Justus Lipsius was older than Wanyan Yongji at the time of their deaths."
        The NO answer is based on this difference in ages, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer to the

        concludes that "Justus Lipsius was not younger than Wanyan Yongji at the time
        of their deaths." The NO answer is based on a clear inequality (59 > 37),
        not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is **NO**" as its final conclusion after comparing the ages at
        death (59 for Lipsius vs 37 for Wanyan Yongji). This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that 88 (Cordelia's age) is greater
        than 71 (William's age), which is why it answers NO to the question of whether
        Cordelia was younger than William. The model is noting a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the ages at death of Cordelia Edvardson (88) and William Cavendish-Bentinck

        that Cordelia Edvardson was older (88 years) than William Cavendish-Bentinck
        (71 years) at their respective times of death. The model explicitly states
        the values are different (88 vs 71), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Cordelia Edvardson was younger at her time of death
        than William Cavendish-Bentinck. The model calculated that Cordelia was 88
        years old at death while William was 71 years old at death, and concluded

        older than Dirck Helmbreker at their times of death." This indicates a difference
        in values, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (ages at
        death) are equal. In fact, it suggests the opposite by saying "If we assume
        that he was born in the early 1500s, he would be significantly younger than
        Bridget of Sweden." The NO answer appears to be based on the assumption that
        Dirck Helmbreker was born after 1373, which would make him younger at death
        than Bridget, not equal in age.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer is: **NO**"
        at the end of its response, even though it previously expressed uncertainty.

        In fact, it explicitly states that Bridget of Sweden was 70 years old at death
        while Dirck Helmbreker was 61 years old, and concludes that "70 (Bridget)
        is greater than 61 (Dirck)." The model is clearly indicating a difference

        claim the values were equal - it stated it lacked information about one of
        the subjects (Claudius Colas) to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" as its final answer, but this
        is actually a case where the model is saying it cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of information about Claudius Colas. The model explicitly states
        "I cannot definitively answer the question" and explains the NO is "because
        we cannot establish that John of Ibelin was younger without knowing Claudius
        Colas's age." This indicates inability to make the comparison rather than
        a comparative result, making this an UNKNOWN response.

        to the question "Was John of Ibelin younger at their time of death than Claudius
        Colas at their time of death?" The model explicitly calculated the ages (John
        at 96 years old and Claudius at 62 years old) and concluded that since John

        that Yan Zhenqing was older (76 years) than Ilya Oleynikov (58 years) at their
        respective times of death. The model explicitly states "Since 76 is greater
        than 58, it follows that Yan Zhenqing was older than Ilya Oleynikov at their
        respective times of death." This indicates inequality, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly concludes that Yan Zhenqing was NOT younger than Ilya Oleynikov
        at their respective times of death, after calculating that Yan Zhenqing was

        In fact, it explicitly calculates and states that Christoph Cellarius died
        at age 69 while Antonio di Vincenzo died at approximately age 62. The model's
        NO answer is based on the comparison that Cellarius (69) was older than di
        Vincenzo (62), not that they were the same age.

        was 46 years old at death, making Cellarius older (not younger) than di Vincenzo.
        The model explicitly states the values are different (69 vs 46), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Christoph Cellarius younger at their time of death than
        Antonio di Vincenzo at their time of death?" The model explains that Christoph
        Cellarius was 69 years old at death while Antonio di Vincenzo was 46 years
        old, and since 69 is greater than 46, Cellarius was older, not younger.

        death while Humphrey of Hauteville was 33 years old. The model gives NO because
        it found that Hippoliet was older (75 > 33), not because they were the same
        age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question 'Was Hippoliet Van Peene younger at their time of death than
        Humphrey of Hauteville at their time of death?' is **NO**." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly states that Hippoliet Van Peene was 81 years old at death
        while Humphrey of Hauteville was 39 years old at death. The model gives the
        NO answer because Hippoliet was older (not younger) than Humphrey at their
        respective times of death, not because they were the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Hippoliet Van Peene
        was not younger at their time of death than Humphrey of Hauteville at their
        time of death." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Hippoliet Van Peene was 52 years old at death while Humphrey of Hauteville
        was 36 years old at death, concluding that Hippoliet was older (not younger)
        than Humphrey. The model explicitly states the values are different (52 vs
        36), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Hippoliet Van Peene younger at their time of death than
        Humphrey of Hauteville at their time of death?" The model clearly indicates
        that Hippoliet Van Peene (52 years old at death) was older than Humphrey of
        Hauteville (36 years old at death), and therefore provides a definitive NO
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that Wolfgang Clement was 81 years old when
        he died while Yi Chong-jun was 78 years old. The model concludes that Wolfgang
        Clement was older than Yi Chong-jun at the time of their respective deaths,
        which is why it answers NO to the question of whether Wolfgang Clement was
        younger. This is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Wolfgang Clement
        was not younger at his time of death than Yi Chong-jun at his time of death."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 81 (Clement's
        age) is not younger than 78 (Yi's age). The model is indicating that Clement
        was actually older (81 > 78), not that they were the same age. The reason
        for the NO is that the comparison goes in the opposite direction than what
        was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Since 81 (Clement''s age)
        is not younger than 78 (Yi''s age), the answer is NO." and concludes with
        "So the final answer is: **NO**." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.'

        Instead, it explicitly calculates that Wolfgang Clement was 82 years old at
        death while Yi Chong-jun was 79 years old, showing they had different ages.
        The model concludes "Wolfgang Clement was not younger" because he was actually
        older (82 > 79), not because they had the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is **NO**" at
        the end of its response, indicating that Wolfgang Clement was not younger

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. On the contrary, it explicitly states that Wolfgang Clement
        was 81 years old at death while Yi Chong-jun was 80 years old. The model clearly
        indicates a difference in values (Wolfgang Clement was older than Yi Chong-jun
        at death), which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the ages at death of Wolfgang Clement (81 years) and Yi Chong-jun
        (80 years). The model explicitly concludes with "**NO**" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that "81 is greater than 76" and
        that "Wolfgang Clement was older than Yi Chong-jun at their respective times
        of death." The NO answer was given because the model found that Wolfgang Clement
        was older (not younger) than Yi Chong-jun at death, not because they were
        the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Thus, the answer to the
        question is **NO**" after determining that Wolfgang Clement was 81 years old
        at death while Yi Chong-jun was 76 years old at death. This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        In fact, it clearly calculates that Wolfgang Clement was 81 years old at death
        while Yi Chong-jun was 77 years old at death. The NO answer is given because
        Wolfgang Clement was older (not younger) than Yi Chong-jun at death, not because
        they were the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Wolfgang Clement younger at their time of death than
