      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Marie was 52-53 years old at
        death while Emperor Wen was 46 years old, and concludes that Marie was older.
        The NO answer is based on this age difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (Marie was older at her
        death)" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question of whether Marie was younger than Emperor Wen at death.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a comparison where
        it found the values were NOT equal. The model explicitly calculated that Jacques
        Perret was 86 years old at death while Hugh the Great was 58 years old at
        death. The model concluded that "Jacques Perret (86) was older than Hugh the
        Great (58)" - indicating a clear difference in values, not equality. The NO
        answer was given because Jacques was older, not because the ages were the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question "Was Jacques Perret younger at their time of
        death than Hugh the Great?" The model provides this answer directly at the
        beginning of its response and reinforces it in the conclusion of its step-by-step

        In fact, it explicitly calculates that Jacques Perret died at 57 years old
        while Hugh the Great died at 58 years old, noting a one-year difference. The
        model concludes "Jacques Perret was not younger (57 vs. 58)" which acknowledges
        a difference in values, not equality.

        while Hugh the Great died at age 66, and concludes that Jacques Perret was
        older (not the same age). The model says "Jacques Perret (72) was older than
        Hugh the Great (66) at their respective deaths" as its reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that Jacques Perret was not younger than Hugh the Great
        at the time of death, and explicitly states "NO" at the beginning of its response

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Jacques Perret
        died at 74 while Hugh the Great died at 58, and concludes that Jacques Perret
        was older at death (not younger). The model is comparing different values
        (74 vs 58) and determining that one is greater than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question of whether Jacques Perret died younger than Hugh
        the Great. The model concludes that Jacques Perret died at 74 while Hugh the
        Great died at 58, and therefore Jacques Perret was not younger at death.

        NO because it found a difference in ages (not because the values were equal).
        The model clearly identifies that Zhang Zhao was older (86 > 47), not that
        they died at the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question "Was Zhang Zhao younger than Henry II at their
        time of death?" The model concludes that Zhang Zhao was older (86 years) than
        Henry II (47 years) at death, so the answer is NO.

        compared are equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that Suzuki Harunobu
        died at 45 while Roger Mortimer died at 24, concluding that Mortimer died
        younger than Harunobu. The model states "Since 24 (Mortimer) is younger than
        45 (Harunobu), Suzuki Harunobu was not younger at the time of death compared
        to Mortimer." The NO is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question "Was Suzuki Harunobu younger at their time of

        Mortimer died at 28, concluding that "Suzuki Harunobu was older at death."
        The model's NO answer is based on a comparison showing different values (45
        vs 28), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Suzuki Harunobu was younger at death than Roger Mortimer. The model

        that "Suzuki Harunobu was older at the time of death than Roger Mortimer."
        The model is saying NO because it found a difference in values (45 vs 32),

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined that
        Suzuki Harunobu died at 45 years old while Roger Mortimer died at 30 years
        old, making Suzuki older at death, not younger. The model did not state that
        the values were equal or the same - it explicitly noted a difference (45 vs
        30 years).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model determined that Suzuki Harunobu died at 45 years

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model determines that Muhammad al-Jawad was 25 years
        old at death while Ptolemy XIV was approximately 16 years old (or younger),

        different values - specifically that Muhammad al-Jawad died at 25 years old
        while Ptolemy XIV died at 17 years old. The model concludes that Muhammad
        al-Jawad was older (not the same age), which is why the answer is NO. The

        it concluded that Muhammad al-Jawad died at age 25 while Ptolemy XIV died
        at age 16, making Ptolemy younger at death. The model explicitly states this
        difference in ages as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model concludes that Muhammad
        al-Jawad was not younger than Ptolemy XIV at their time of death, after determining

        concludes that "Muhammad al-Jawad was older at his time of death than Ptolemy
        XIV." The model is saying NO because Muhammad was older (25), not younger,

        NO is that Muhammad was older (25 > 19), not that they were the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model explicitly concludes "NO" at both the beginning and end of its response,

        XIV was 19" and concludes "Since 25 > 19, Muhammad was older at his death."
        The NO answer is because Muhammad was older, not because the ages were the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model determines that Muhammad al-Jawad was 25 years

        different scenarios, but never commits to a definitive YES or NO answer. At
        the very end, the model suggests "the answer would be NO" based on an assumption

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Gabriela Silang died at age
        44 while John Hastings died at age ~16, concluding that "Gabriela was older"
        at death. The NO answer is based on this difference in ages, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both at the beginning and end of its response. The model directly answers
        the comparative question with a definitive NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it concludes
        that Gabriela (40) was older than John (14) at their times of death, not younger
        as the question asked. The model explicitly states the ages are different
        (40 vs 14).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model determines that Gabriela Silang was not younger
        than John Hastings at their times of death because Gabriela died at 40 while
        John died at 14.

        are equal. Instead, it concludes that Gabriela Silang was older at death (32
        years) than the 3rd Earl of Pembroke (14 years). The model explicitly states
        "Gabriela was older, so the answer is NO" in its reasoning. This is a clear
        difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        without any qualifications or uncertainty. The model provides this as a direct
        comparative result after its analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines that Gabriela
        Silang was older (32) than John Hastings (10) when they died. The model explicitly
        states "Since Gabriela Silang was 32 at her death compared to John Hastings'
        10, she was older." This indicates a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that Gabriela Silang was not younger than John Hastings
        when they died because she was 32 at death while he was only 10.

        Round was older at death (73 years) than Woodville (67 years), not because
        they had equal values. The model explicitly states "Round was older at his
        time of death" as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response after comparing the ages of J. Horace Round (73) and Richard
        Woodville (67) at their deaths.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Van Peene was older at death
        (80 years) than Humphrey (28 years). The model says "Van Peene was significantly
        older at the time of his death than Humphrey of Hauteville" as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question of whether Hippoliet Van Peene was younger than
        Humphrey of Hauteville when they each died.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    2ae846d8-9f25-48ae-8caa-01ef8e8fe770:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Van Peene was older (78) than
        Humphrey (41) at their respective deaths, which is why it answers NO. The
        model is comparing different values and finding that one is larger than the
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Hippoliet Van Peene was younger at death than Humphrey of Hauteville.
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Van Peene was 71 at death while
        Humphrey was 48, and concludes that "Van Peene was older at death than Humphrey
        of Hauteville" because "71 > 48". The NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line: "**Answer**: NO". The model clearly concludes that Hippoliet
        Van Peene was NOT younger than Humphrey of Hauteville at death.'

        at death (64 years) than Humphrey of Hauteville (39 years). The model's reasoning
        for the NO answer is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. This is stated both at the beginning

    bc7a2d52-ecc2-4319-8846-70c216b728fd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Hippoliet Van Peene died at
        age 67 while Humphrey of Hauteville died at approximately 53 years old. The
        model's NO answer is based on the fact that 67 is older than 53, not that
        the ages are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is bolded at the end of the response. The model clearly concludes that
        Hippoliet Van Peene was not younger at death than Humphrey of Hauteville.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that Hippoliet Van Peene died at age 70 while Humphrey
        of Hauteville died at age 80, and since 70 < 80, it answers "YES" to the question
        of whether Van Peene died at a younger age.

    cdc75fad-0f27-4d4c-98a4-cf38b66d480b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Hippoliet Van Peene died at
        age 73 while Humphrey of Hauteville died at approximately 47 years old. The
        model's reasoning for the NO answer is that "73 is older than 47," indicating
        a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Hippoliet Van Peene was younger than Humphrey of Hauteville when
        they died. The answer is explicitly bolded at the end of the response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that Van Peene was significantly
        older at death (71 years) than Humphrey (33 years). The model concludes "Since
        Van Peene was significantly older at death than Humphrey, the answer is NO."
        This indicates the values are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model provides a definitive comparative
        conclusion that Van Peene was not younger at death than Humphrey of Hauteville.

    d9bfee39-0574-4401-966b-5cd8c81cdf27:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a comparison showing
        that the values are not equal - it states that Hippoliet Van Peene was 88
        years old at death while Humphrey of Hauteville was approximately 47-57 years
        old. The model explicitly notes this difference ("88 is significantly older
        than 47-57") as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, clearly indicating that Hippoliet Van Peene was not younger
        at their time of death than Humphrey of Hauteville.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Van Peene
        died at 71 while Humphrey died at 61, and concludes that "Since 71 > 61, Van
        Peene was older at death." The model is saying NO because Van Peene was older,
        not because they were the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the initial one-word response and in its conclusion where it states
        "The answer is NO, as Hippoliet Van Peene was not younger than Humphrey of
        Hauteville at their respective times of death."

        Wolfgang Clement was older (89 years) than Yi Chong-jun (78 years) at their
        time of death, not because the values being compared were equal. The model
        explicitly states there was an 11-year difference between their ages at death.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model determined that Wolfgang Clement was older (89
        years) than Yi Chong-jun (78 years) at their time of death, and therefore
