      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, it's based on the fact that Marie died at approximately 53
        years old while Emperor Wen died at approximately 45 years old. The model
        explicitly states "Since 45 is less than 53, Emperor Wen of Han was younger
        at his time of death than Marie of France, Countess of Champagne." This indicates
        a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly saying "Marie of France was NOT younger at her time of death than
        Emperor Wen of Han at his time of death." This is a direct comparative answer
        to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Marie
        was older (52-53 years) than Emperor Wen (45 years) at their respective deaths.
        The model clearly identifies a difference in values as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes "Marie of France lived to be about 52-53 years old, while
        Emperor Wen died at about 45 years of age. Since 52-53 is greater than 45,
        Marie was NOT younger at her time of death than Emperor Wen was at his. NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Marie of France was 53 years
        old at death while Emperor Wen of Han was 45 years old. The model gives the
        reason for its NO answer as "She lived 8 years longer than he did," indicating
        a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Marie of France, Countess of Champagne younger at their

        53 while Emperor Wen of Han died at age 45, and it concludes that "Marie of
        France was older at her time of death than Emperor Wen was at his." The NO
        answer is based on the fact that Marie was older (not the same age), not that
        they were equal in age.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response, indicating that Marie of France was NOT younger

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Jacques Perret died at approximately
        91 years old while Hugh the Great died at approximately 58 years old. The
        model's NO answer is based on the fact that Jacques Perret was older at death
        (not younger), not that they were the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "Jacques Perret was NOT younger at his time of death

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Jacques
        Perret was NOT younger at his time of death than Hugh the Great. The model
        explicitly states that Jacques Perret died at 91 years of age while Hugh the
        Great died at approximately 58 years of age. The model concludes "Since 91
        > 58, Jacques Perret was NOT younger at his time of death than Hugh the Great."
        This indicates the values are different (not equal), with Perret being older,
        not the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes: "# Answer: NO" after determining that Jacques Perret

        58 years old, and concludes that "Since 91 is greater than 58, Jacques Perret
        was NOT younger at his time of death than Hugh the Great." The model is noting
        a difference in values (91 vs 58), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. The model concludes that Jacques Perret
        was NOT younger at his time of death than Hugh the Great, after determining

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because Jacques Perret
        died at 91 years old while Hugh the Great died at 58 years old, making Jacques
        Perret older at death, not younger. The model does not state that the values
        are equal or the same - it explicitly notes that 91 is greater than 58.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that Jacques Perret died at ~86
        years old while Hugh the Great died at ~58 years old, and concludes that "Since
        86 is greater than 58, Jacques Perret was NOT younger at his time of death
        than Hugh the Great was at his time of death." The model is clearly indicating
        a difference in values (86 > 58), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly answers the comparative
        question with a definitive "NO" after comparing the ages at death (86 years
        for Jacques Perret vs. 58 years for Hugh the Great).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (ages at
        death) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Yolanda was older at
        death than Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr. The model calculates that Muhammad died
        at approximately 27 years old, while Yolanda (either version of her) died
        at either 44 or 69 years old. The NO answer is based on Yolanda being older,
        not the same age.

        states "Since 66 > 49, Petrus Armengol was older (not younger) than Alonso
        de Ojeda at the time of death." This indicates a clear difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after comparing the ages at death of Petrus Armengol (66 years) and Alonso
        de Ojeda (48-49 years). The model explicitly concludes that "Petrus Armengol

        64 years of age while Alexander Pope died at 56 years of age, and that "Conrad
        was older by approximately 8 years." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in ages, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        stated that Conrad died at approximately 64 years while Alexander Pope died
        at 56 years, showing a clear difference in values. The NO answer was given
        because Conrad was older (not younger) than Alexander Pope at death.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model determined that Conrad was NOT
        younger than Alexander Pope at the time of death because Conrad died at approximately
        64 years while Alexander Pope died at 56 years.

        Instead, it explicitly states that Conrad died at an older age (64) than Pope
        (56). The model's NO answer is based on Conrad being older, not on the ages
        being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Conrad was not younger

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that Wolfgang Clement
        was older (80 years) than Yi Chong-jun (69 years) at their respective times
        of death. The model clearly identified a difference in values as the reason
        for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes that Wolfgang Clement
        died at 80 years old while Yi Chong-jun died at 69 years old, showing a clear
        difference in their ages at death. The model's NO answer is based on this
        difference (Wolfgang being older, not younger), not on any equality between
        the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question about
        whether Wolfgang Clement was younger at his time of death than Yi Chong-jun.
        The model explains that Wolfgang Clement died at 80 years old while Yi Chong-jun
        died at 69 years old, and concludes with a definitive "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because Wolfgang Clement
        was older (80 years) at his time of death than Yi Chong-jun (69 years), not
        because the values were equal. The model explicitly states "Wolfgang Clement
        died at 80 years old, while Yi Chong-jun died at 69 years old" and concludes
        "Since 80 is greater than 69, Wolfgang Clement was NOT younger at his time
        of death than Yi Chong-jun." The model is noting a difference in values, not
        equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Wolfgang
        Clement was older (80 years) at death than Yi Chong-jun (69 years), not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states "Wolfgang Clement died
        at 80 years old, while Yi Chong-jun died at 69 years old. Since 80 is greater
        than 69, Wolfgang Clement was older (not younger) at his time of death." This
        indicates a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Wolfgang Clement younger at their time of death than
        Yi Chong-jun at their time of death?" The model explicitly concludes with
        "NO" after determining that Wolfgang Clement died at 80 years old while Yi
        Chong-jun died at 69 years old.

        "Wolfgang Clement was NOT younger than Yi Chong-jun at their respective times
        of death." The model is saying NO because Wolfgang Clement was older (80 years)
        than Yi Chong-jun (68 years), not because they were the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its thinking process, and in the final formatted answer it states "#
