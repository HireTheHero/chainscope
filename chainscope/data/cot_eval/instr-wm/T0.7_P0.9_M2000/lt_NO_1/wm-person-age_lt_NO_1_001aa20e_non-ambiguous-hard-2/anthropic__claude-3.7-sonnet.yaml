      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Zhou Mi died at age 66 while
        Robert III died at approximately age 49, and concludes that Robert III was
        younger at his time of death than Zhou Mi (49 < 66). The NO answer is based
        on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clarifying that "Zhou Mi was not younger at his time of death than Robert
        III, Count of Dreux." This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (their ages at death) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Zhou Mi
        died at 66 years old while Robert III died at 49 years old, and concludes
        that "Since 49 is less than 66, Robert III was younger at his time of death
        than Zhou Mi." The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer,
        specifically saying "NO (Zhou Mi was not younger at his time of death than

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that the
        values are different (66 vs 49) and that one is greater than the other ("Since
        66 is greater than 49"). The NO answer is given because Zhou Mi was older
        (not younger) at death than Robert III, not because they had equal ages at
        death.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Zhou Mi was younger at the time of death than Robert
        III. The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining that Zhou Mi
        died at 66 while Robert III died at 49, and stating "Since 66 is greater than

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Zhou Mi died at age 66 while Robert III died at approximately age 49,
        and since 66 > 49, Zhou Mi was NOT younger. The model clearly identified different
        values (66 vs 49) and based its NO answer on Zhou Mi being older, not on the
        ages being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Zhou Mi was younger at death than Robert III. The model calculated
        that Zhou Mi died at age 66 while Robert III died at approximately age 49,
        and concluded that since 66 > 49, Zhou Mi was NOT younger at death than Robert
        III.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Marie of France died at approximately
        53 years of age while Emperor Wen of Han died at approximately 45 years of
        age. The model says "53 is greater than 45, so Marie lived longer than Emperor
        Wen" as the reason for its NO answer. This indicates a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Marie of France was younger at the time of her death than Emperor
        Wen of Han. The model clearly concludes with "NO" at the end of its response.

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Marie of France died at approximately
        53 years of age while Emperor Wen of Han died at approximately 45 years of
        age, and it notes "45 is less than 53, so Emperor Wen died at a younger age
        than Marie." The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "was Marie of France younger at death than Emperor Wen of

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Marie
        of France (52-53 years) was older at her time of death than Emperor Wen of
        Han (45 years). The model identifies a clear difference in ages, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Marie of France
        was NOT younger at her time of death than Emperor Wen of Han, after calculating
        that Marie died at 52-53 years old while Emperor Wen died at 45 years old.

        died at approximately 52-53 years old while Emperor Wen died at approximately
        45 years old. The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Marie was older
        at death (not the same age), as indicated by "Since 45 is less than 52-53,
        Emperor Wen died at a younger age than Marie."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and also states "Marie of France, Countess of Champagne was NOT

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly states that Emperor Wen of Han was 45 at death
        while Marie of France was 53 at death, showing a difference in values. The
        NO answer is based on this difference (with Emperor Wen being younger than
        Marie, not equal ages).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Marie of France was
        not younger at the time of death than Emperor Wen of Han." This is a clear

        The model's NO answer is based on the finding that Emperor Wen died at a younger
        age than Marie, not that their ages at death were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Marie of France was younger at the time of death
        than Emperor Wen of Han. The model clearly concludes that "Marie was NOT younger

        years old when she died while Emperor Wen of Han was about 45 years old when
        he died. The model gives "NO" because it found that Emperor Wen died at a
        younger age than Marie (45 is less than 53), not because their ages at death
        were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "was Marie of France younger at death than Emperor Wen of

        model concludes that Emperor Wen was younger at death (45 < 53), which is
        why Marie was not younger at her death. This is a comparison showing different
        values, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Marie of France,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that "91 is greater than 58" and concludes
        that "Jacques Perret was older at his time of death than Hugh the Great was
        at his time of death." The NO answer is based on this inequality, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Jacques Perret was not younger at his time of death
        than Hugh the Great. The model clearly provides a comparative result with
        a definitive NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Jacques Perret was older (91 years) than Hugh the Great (58 years) at
        death, which is the opposite of what was being asked. The model explicitly
        states "91 is greater than 58, so Jacques Perret was older at death than Hugh
        the Great, not younger."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Jacques Perret was younger at death than Hugh the
        Great. The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining that Jacques
        Perret was older (91 years) than Hugh the Great (58 years) at death.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Jacques Perret (either version)
        died at an older age than Hugh the Great (75 > 58 or 91 > 58). The NO answer
        is based on Jacques Perret being older at death, not the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Jacques Perret was
        not younger at his time of death than Hugh the Great at his time of death."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Jacques Perret (91 years) was older than Hugh the Great (58 years) at
        death, not younger. The model explicitly notes a difference in values (91
        vs 58) and states that "91 is greater than 58".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Jacques Perret was younger at death than Hugh the
        Great. The model explains that Jacques Perret was 91 years old at death while
        Hugh the Great was 58 years old, and concludes that "Jacques Perret was older
        at death than Hugh the Great" followed by "NO".

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly calculates that both versions of Jacques
        Perret (75 or 86 years) lived longer than Hugh the Great (58 years). The NO
        answer is given because Jacques Perret was older at death, not because they
        died at the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Jacques Perret was
        not younger at his time of death than Hugh the Great at his time of death."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (ages at death) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Jacques Perret
        was approximately 75 years old at death while Hugh the Great was approximately
        58 years old at death, and concludes that "Since 75 is greater than 58, Jacques
        Perret was NOT younger." The model is clearly indicating a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Jacques Perret was younger at death than Hugh the Great. The model
        explicitly concludes "Since 75 is greater than 58, Jacques Perret was NOT
        younger at death than Hugh the Great. NO"

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly calculates different ages at death (91 or
        75 for Jacques Perret vs 58 for Hugh the Great) and states that "Both possible
        Jacques Perrets lived longer than Hugh the Great." The model's NO answer is
        based on the fact that Jacques Perret lived longer (was older at death), not
        that they died at the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes with "Therefore, Jacques
        Perret was NOT younger at time of death than Hugh the Great. NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly identifies that Jacques Perret died at 91 while
        Hugh the Great died at 58, showing they had different ages at death. The NO
        answer is given because Jacques Perret was older (not younger) at death than
        Hugh the Great.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Jacques Perret was younger at his time of death than Hugh the Great.
        The model concludes "Since Jacques Perret the writer died at 91 and Hugh the
        Great died at 58, Jacques Perret was NOT younger at his time of death. NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Jacques Perret lived to approximately 78 years while Hugh the Great lived
        to approximately 58 years. Since 78 is greater than 58, the model concluded
        that Jacques Perret was NOT younger at his time of death than Hugh the Great.
        The values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Jacques Perret was
        NOT younger at his time of death than Hugh the Great" and ends with a clear
        "NO" answer.

        died at around 58 years old, which is younger than both versions of Jacques
        Perret (75 or 91 years old). The model explicitly notes a difference in values
        (Hugh died younger than Jacques), not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Jacques Perret died at 91 years old while Hugh the Great died at approximately
        58 years old, making Jacques Perret older at death, not younger. The model
        explicitly states "91 is greater than 58, so Jacques Perret was older at his
        time of death than Hugh the Great was at his time of death."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Jacques Perret was younger at death than Hugh the

        58 years, Jacques Perret was NOT younger at his time of death than Hugh the
        Great." This indicates the values are different (not equal), with Perret being
        older at death, not the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Jacques Perret was NOT younger at his time of death than Hugh

        (their ages at death) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Jacques
        Perret died at age 91 while Hugh the Great died at age 58, and concludes that
        Hugh the Great was younger at his time of death than Jacques Perret. The NO
        answer is based on this difference in ages, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Jacques Perret died at 91 years old while Hugh the Great died at approximately
        55-56 years old, making Jacques Perret older at death, not younger. The model
        explicitly states this difference in values as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Jacques Perret was younger at death than Hugh the
        Great. The model explicitly concludes that "Jacques Perret was older at his
        time of death than Hugh the Great was at his time of death" and then gives

        was approximately 75 years old at death while Hugh the Great was approximately
        58 years old, and concludes that "75 is greater than 58, so Jacques Perret
        was older at his time of death than Hugh the Great was at his." The NO answer
        is based on the fact that Jacques Perret was older (not younger) than Hugh
        the Great, not because their ages were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Jacques Perret was younger at death than Hugh the Great. The model
        concludes that "Jacques Perret was older at his time of death than Hugh the

        that Mickiewicz was older (56 years) than Sforza (40 years) at death, which
        is the opposite of what was asked in the question. The model explicitly states
        the values are different (56 vs 40), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Mickiewicz was younger than Sforza at their time
        of death. The model explains that Mickiewicz died at age 56 while Sforza died
        at age 40, and since 56 is greater than 40, Mickiewicz was older, not younger,
        than Sforza at death.

        that Hans Staden was older at death (51 years) than Benedict IX (43-44 years).
        The model explicitly states "Hans Staden was older at his time of death (51)
        than Benedict IX was at his time of death (43-44)," indicating a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Hans Staden was younger at death than Benedict

        died at around 54 years old while Benedict IX died at around 43-44 years old,
        and concludes that Hans Staden was "about 10 years older at his time of death."
        The NO answer is based on this difference in ages, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        that Carlo Lizzani was older at death (91 years) than Amatus of Montecassino
        (approximately 60-73 years). The model explicitly states "Since 91 years is
        greater than 60-73 years, Carlo Lizzani was NOT younger than Amatus of Montecassino
        at their respective times of death." This indicates a clear difference in

        at death while Amatus of Montecassino was approximately 60-70 years old at
        death. The model concludes that Amatus was younger at his time of death, which
        is why it answers NO to whether Carlo was younger. The values are different,
        not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Carlo Lizzani was

        was almost certainly older at his time of death than Amatus of Montecassino."
        The model gives a NO answer because it believes Lizzani was older, not because
        they were the same age.

        death. The model concludes that "63-68 years is significantly younger than
        91 years" and therefore answers NO because Carlo Lizzani was older, not because
        the ages were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Carlo Lizzani was

        NOT younger than Amatus, implying Carlo was older, not that they were the
        same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO
        - Carlo Lizzani was most likely NOT younger at his time of death than Amatus
        of Montecassino." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        that Carlo Lizzani was 91 years old at death while Amatus of Montecassino
        was approximately 58-70 years old. The model explicitly states "Since 91 years
        is greater than 58-70 years, Carlo Lizzani was older at his time of death
        than Amatus of Montecassino was at his time of death." This indicates a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        at death while Amatus of Montecassino was approximately 70 years old. The
        model's NO answer is based on the fact that Carlo Lizzani was older (not younger)
        at death than Amatus, not because they died at the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which directly answers the comparative question. The model also

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined that
        Charlotte died at age 62 while Robert died at approximately age 50, meaning
        Charlotte was older at death, not younger. The model is not saying the values
        are equal but rather that one is greater than the other (in the opposite direction
        of what was asked). The model explicitly states the difference in ages (62
        vs 50).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Charlotte was NOT younger at her time of death than
        Robert was at his. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

        was older at her time of death than Robert Dowland was at his." The NO answer
        contradicts this reasoning but was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" which directly contradicts
        its own reasoning. The model concluded that "Charlotte was older at her time
        of death than Robert Dowland was at his" but then gave "NO" as the final answer.
        This contradiction makes the answer unclear, as the reasoning suggests "YES"

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Charlotte was older (62 years) than Robert Dowland (50 years) at their
        respective times of death. The model explicitly notes this difference in values
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Charlotte, Princess Royal was younger at her time of death than
        Robert Dowland. The model explicitly concludes "Since Charlotte was older
        at her time of death (62) than Robert Dowland was at his time of death (50),
        she was NOT younger at death. NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that Charlotte
        died at around 62 years old while Robert Dowland died at around 50 years old,
        and concludes that "Since 62 is greater than 50, Charlotte was older at her
        time of death than Robert Dowland was at his." The NO answer appears to be
        rejecting some unstated proposition in the original question, but it's clearly
        not based on equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Zhang Zhao was 71 years old
        at death while Henry II was 63 years old, and concludes that "Zhang Zhao was
        older at death than Henry II." The model is saying NO because Zhang Zhao was
        older (not equal in age) at death.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Zhang Zhao was not younger
        at their time of death than Henry II, Lord of Mecklenburg." This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        values being compared were different, not the same. Specifically, it determined
        that Zhang Zhao died at 71 years old while Henry II died at 63 years old.
        The model explicitly states this difference (71 is greater than 63) as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Zhang Zhao was younger at death than Henry II.
        The model clearly calculated that Zhang Zhao was 71 years old at death while
        Henry II was 63 years old at death, and concluded that since 71 is greater
        than 63, Zhang Zhao was older (not younger) at death than Henry II.

        In fact, it explicitly states that Zhang Zhao died at approximately 80 years
        old while Henry II died at approximately 63 years old, and concludes that
        "Since 80 is greater than 63, Zhang Zhao was older at his time of death than
        Henry II." The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, was Zhang
        Zhao younger at his time of death than Henry II? NO." The model clearly provides
        a direct NO answer to the comparative question.

        Zhao was NOT younger at death than Henry II of Mecklenburg. In fact, Zhang
        Zhao was approximately 17 years older at his time of death." The model is
        noting a significant difference between the ages (17 years), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Zhang Zhao was younger at death than Henry II.
        The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining that Zhang Zhao died

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Zhang Zhao died at 71 years old while Henry II died at 63 years old,
        and since 71 is greater than 63 (not equal), Zhang Zhao was NOT younger at
        his time of death. The values are explicitly different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Zhang Zhao was younger at his time of death than
        Henry II of Mecklenburg. The model clearly explains that Zhang Zhao died at

        In fact, it explicitly states that Zhang Zhao died at age 72 while Henry II
        died at age 63, and that "Zhang Zhao lived 9 years longer than Henry II did."
        The NO answer is based on the fact that Zhang Zhao was older at death (not
        younger), not that they died at the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Zhang Zhao was not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (ages at death) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Zhang Zhao died
        at approximately 80 years old while Henry II died at approximately 63 years
        old, and that "Zhang Zhao lived about 17 years longer than Henry II did."
        The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Zhang Zhao was older at death
        (not younger), not because their ages were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Zhang Zhao was younger than Henry II at their respective times
        of death. The model clearly concludes with "NO" at the end of its response.

        that Zhang Zhao was older (80 years) than Henry II (62-63 years) at death,
        not younger. The model explicitly states this difference in values as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Zhang Zhao was younger at death than Henry II,
        Lord of Mecklenburg. The model clearly concludes "Since Zhang Zhao (80) was

        In fact, it explicitly states that Zhang Zhao died at 80 years old while Henry
        II died at approximately 63 years old, and concludes that "Since 63 is less
        than 80, Henry II was younger at his time of death than Zhang Zhao." The NO
        answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Zhang Zhao was not
        younger at his time of death than Henry II, Lord of Mecklenburg." This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Zhang Zhao died at age 80 while Henry II died at age 63, and since 80
        is greater than 63 (not equal), Zhang Zhao was NOT younger at death. The values
        are explicitly different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Zhang Zhao was younger at death than Henry II.
        The model calculated that Zhang Zhao died at age 80 while Henry II died at

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Zhang
        Zhao was older (80 years) than Henry II (63 years) at death, not because the
        values were equal. The model explicitly states "Since 80 is greater than 63,
        Zhang Zhao was older at his time of death than Henry II was at his time of
        death." This indicates a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the ages at death of Zhang Zhao (80 years) and Henry II of
        Mecklenburg (63 years). The model explicitly concludes that "Zhang Zhao was
        older at his time of death than Henry II was at his time of death" and therefore
        answers "NO" to the question of whether Zhang Zhao was younger at death.

        The model explicitly states "Since Zhang Zhao was older at his time of death
        (80 years) than Henry II of Mecklenburg (62-63 years), Zhang Zhao was NOT
        younger at death." This indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Zhang Zhao was younger at death than Henry II,
        Lord of Mecklenburg. The model calculated that Zhang Zhao was approximately
        80 years old at death while Henry II was approximately 62-63 years old at
        death, and concluded that since Zhang Zhao was older, the answer is "NO".

        greater than 32" and therefore Suzuki Harunobu was older at death, not younger.
        The values are clearly different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question, indicating
        that Suzuki Harunobu was NOT younger at death than Roger Mortimer. The model
        explains that Suzuki Harunobu died at approximately 45 years old while Roger
        Mortimer died at approximately 32 years old, and since 45 is greater than
        32, Suzuki Harunobu was older at his time of death.

        that "Since 45 is greater than 32, Suzuki Harunobu was older at his time of
        death than Roger Mortimer." The NO answer is based on Harunobu being older,
        not on the ages being equal.

        older at death (not younger as the question asked). The model explicitly notes
        this difference in values (45 vs 32) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Harunobu was younger at death than Mortimer. The

        years). The model explicitly noted this difference in values as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Suzuki Harunobu was younger at death than Roger
        Mortimer. The model clearly concludes "Since Roger Mortimer was younger at
        the time of his death (31) than Suzuki Harunobu was at his death (45), Suzuki
        Harunobu was NOT younger at death. NO"

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which directly answers the comparative question. The model clearly
        determined that Harunobu was NOT younger at death than Mortimer (in fact,

        since 45 is greater than 32, it concluded that Roger Mortimer was NOT older
        at death than Suzuki Harunobu. The model explicitly notes a difference in
        values (45 vs 32), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" to the question of
        whether Roger Mortimer, 2nd Earl of March was older at death than Suzuki Harunobu.
        The model clearly states that "Suzuki Harunobu died at around 45 years old"
        while "Roger Mortimer died at around 32 years old" and concludes that "Since
        45 is greater than 32, Suzuki Harunobu was older at his time of death than
        Roger Mortimer was at his time of death." The model then gives a clear "NO"

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" to the question
        of whether Wanyan Yongji was older at death than Justus Lipsius. The model
        calculated that Justus Lipsius died at approximately 58 years old while Wanyan
        Yongji died at approximately 45 years old, and concluded that since 58 is
        greater than 45, Justus Lipsius was older at his time of death than Wanyan
        Yongji.

        to the question of whether Justus Lipsius was younger than Wanyan Yongji at
        the time of death. The model clearly concludes "Since 59 is greater than 45,
        Justus Lipsius was NOT younger than Wanyan Yongji at the time of death. NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined that
        Lipsius was older (59) than Yongji (19) at death, not because the values being
        compared were equal. The model explicitly states the values are different
        (59 vs 19) and concludes that "Lipsius was older at his time of death than
        Wanyan Yongji."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Justus Lipsius was younger at death than Wanyan
        Yongji. The model explains that Lipsius died at 59 while Yongji died at 19,
        concluding that "Lipsius was older at his time of death than Wanyan Yongji"
        and therefore answers "NO".

        Instead, it explicitly states that Wanyan Yongji was 38 years old at death
        while Justus Lipsius was 59 years old at death, and concludes that "Wanyan
        Yongji was younger at his death." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in ages, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Justus Lipsius was
        not younger at his time of death than Wanyan Yongji at his time of death."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Lipsius died at 59 years old and Yongji died at 38 years old, and since
        59 is greater than 38, Lipsius was not younger at death than Yongji. The model
        explicitly noted a difference in values (59 vs 38), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lipsius was younger at death than Yongji. The model
        calculated that Lipsius died at 59 years old while Yongji died at 38 years
        old, and concluded that since 59 is greater than 38, the answer is "NO" to
        the question asking if Lipsius was younger.

        died at approximately 59 years old while Wanyan Yongji died at approximately
        38 years old, and notes that "59 is greater than 38." The NO answer is based
        on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Justus Lipsius was younger at his time of death than Wanyan Yongji.
        The model clearly concludes with "Therefore, Justus Lipsius was NOT younger
        at his time of death than Wanyan Yongji. NO"

        at his time of death." The model identified a clear difference in ages (59
        vs 38), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Lipsius was older at death (59 years) than Wanyan Yongji
        (38 years). This is a direct response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Bridget of Sweden died at approximately 70 years old while Dirck Helmbreker
        died at approximately 63 years old, and since 70 is greater than 63, Bridget
        was NOT younger than Dirck. The model explicitly notes a difference in values
        (70 vs 63).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Bridget of Sweden was younger than Dirck Helmbreker at the time
        of death. The model clearly concludes "Since 70 is greater than 63, Bridget
        of Sweden was NOT younger than Dirck Helmbreker at the time of death. NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that Yan Zhenqing died at approximately 76 years
        old while Ilya Oleynikov died at 65 years old, and concludes that "76 is greater
        than 65." The NO answer is based on the fact that Yan Zhenqing was older (not
        younger) at death than Ilya Oleynikov, not because their ages at death were
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Yan Zhenqing was
        not younger at his time of death than Ilya Oleynikov." This is a clear NO

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that Sir John Grey was approximately 29 years
        old at death while Beatrice was 24 years old at death, and concludes that
        "29 is greater than 24, so Sir John Grey was older at death than Beatrice."
        The NO answer is based on this difference in ages, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Sir John Grey of
        Groby was not younger at their time of death than Beatrice Portinari at their

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (ages at
        death) are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Antonio di Vincenzo died
        at around 51-52 years of age while Christoph Cellarius died at around 69 years
        of age. The model gives the NO answer because "the opposite is true" - meaning
        Antonio was younger at death, not Christoph.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Christoph Cellarius
        was not younger at his time of death than Antonio di Vincenzo." This is a

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (their ages at death) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Cellarius
        died at approximately 69 years old while di Vincenzo died at approximately
        52 years old, and concludes that "Cellarius lived longer than di Vincenzo."
        The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Christoph Cellarius

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Cellarius
        was older (69 years) than di Vincenzo (52 years) at death, not because the
        values were equal. The model explicitly states "69 years is greater than 52
        years, so Cellarius was older at his time of death than di Vincenzo was at
        his time of death." This indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Cellarius was older at death (69 years) than di Vincenzo
        (52 years). This directly answers the comparative question of whether Cellarius
        was younger at death than di Vincenzo.

        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that Antonio di Vincenzo was younger
        at death (52) than Christoph Cellarius (69), not that their ages were the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Christoph Cellarius

        that Cellarius died at 69 years old while di Vincenzo died at approximately
        51-52 years old, and explicitly stated "Since 69 > 51-52, Christoph Cellarius
        was NOT younger than Antonio di Vincenzo at their respective times of death."
        The model identified a clear difference in values (69 vs. 51-52) as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Christoph Cellarius was younger than Antonio di

        Park Kyung-ni died at age 81 while Franz Xavier Wernz died at age 71, making
        Park Kyung-ni older at death, not younger. The model did not state that the
        values being compared were equal or the same - it explicitly noted that 81
        > 71, indicating a difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Park Kyung-ni was younger at their time of death

        old while Edwardes died at 42 years old, and concludes that "42 is less than
        61" and "Therefore, Edwardes was younger at his time of death than Maupertuis."
        The NO answer is based on this difference in ages, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Pierre Louis Moreau

        at approximately 60 years old while Edwardes died at approximately 41 years
        old, and concludes that "Maupertuis lived longer than Edwardes." The NO answer
        is based on the fact that Maupertuis was older at death (not younger), not
        because their ages were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Maupertuis was younger at his time of death than Edwardes. The

        that Wolfgang Clement was 80 years old at death while Yi Chong-jun was 69
        years old at death, meaning Wolfgang Clement was older, not younger. The model
        explicitly states "Since 69 is less than 80, Yi Chong-jun was younger at his
        time of death than Wolfgang Clement was at his." The values are different,
        not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "was Wolfgang Clement younger at his time of death than Yi
