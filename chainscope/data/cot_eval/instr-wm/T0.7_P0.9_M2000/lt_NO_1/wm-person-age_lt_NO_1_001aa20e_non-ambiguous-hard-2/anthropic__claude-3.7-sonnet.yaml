      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Triewald
        was older (56 years) than Charles III (40-41 years) at their respective deaths,
        not because the values were equal. The model explicitly states "56 is greater
        than 40-41, so Triewald was older at his time of death than Charles III was
        at his time of death." This indicates a difference in values, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Zhou
        Mi died at age 66 while Robert III died at age 49, which means Zhou Mi was
        older (not younger) at death. The model did not state that the values were
        equal or the same - it explicitly noted that 66 is greater than 49. The NO
        answer was based on this inequality, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Zhou Mi died at age 66 and Robert III died at age 49,

        In fact, it explicitly states that Zhou Mi died at age 66 and Robert III died
        at age 49, and concludes that "Since 49 is less than 66, Robert III was younger
        at his time of death than Zhou Mi was at his time of death." The NO answer

        that Zhou Mi died at age 66 while Robert III died at age 49, and since 66
        is greater than 49, Zhou Mi was older (not younger) at his time of death.
        The model explicitly notes this difference in values as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Zhou Mi was younger at his time of death than Robert
        III. The model clearly concludes "Therefore, Zhou Mi was NOT younger at his
        time of death. NO"

        (their ages at death) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Zhou Mi
        died at 66 years old while Robert III died at 49 years old, and concludes
        that "Since 49 is less than 66, Robert III was younger at his time of death
        than Zhou Mi." The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer,
        specifically saying "NO (Zhou Mi was not younger at his time of death than
        Robert III, Count of Dreux)". This is a clear negative response to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Zhou Mi died
        at age 66 while Robert III died at age 49, and concludes that "Zhou Mi was
        NOT younger at death than Robert III. Zhou Mi was actually 17 years older
        at his time of death." The model is noting a clear difference in values (66
        vs 49), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Zhou Mi was younger at death than Robert III. The model clearly
        concludes that Zhou Mi was NOT younger at death than Robert III, and provides
        the specific ages (Zhou Mi died at 66, Robert III died at 49).

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Zhou Mi died at age 66 while
        Robert III died at age 49, and that "49 is less than 66." The NO answer is
        given because Robert III was younger at death than Zhou Mi, not because their
        ages were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Zhou Mi was not younger
        at his time of death than Robert III, Count of Dreux." This is a clear NO

        Instead, it explicitly states that "Zhou Mi died at age 66" and "Robert III
        died at age 49" and concludes that "Since 49 is less than 66, Robert III was
        younger at his time of death than Zhou Mi." The NO answer is based on the
        fact that the values are different (with Robert III being younger), not that
        they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Zhou Mi was not younger

        died at approximately 52-53 years old while Emperor Wen died at approximately
        45 years old. The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Marie was older
        at death (not the same age), as indicated by "Since 45 is less than 52-53,
        Emperor Wen died at a younger age than Marie."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and also states "Marie of France, Countess of Champagne was NOT
        younger at her time of death than Emperor Wen of Han." This is a clear negative

        Perret was older (91 years) at death than Hugh the Great (58 years), not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states "91 is greater than 58,
        so Jacques Perret was older at death than Hugh the Great, not younger." This
        indicates a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Jacques Perret was younger at death than Hugh the

        58 years of age, showing a difference in values. The model's NO answer is
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The

        died at approximately 54 years old and Benedict IX died at approximately 44
        years old, showing a clear difference in values. The model's NO answer is
        based on the fact that Hans Staden was older at death (54) than Benedict IX
        (44), not that they had equal ages at death.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Hans Staden was younger at death than Benedict
        IX. The model clearly concludes that Hans Staden was NOT younger at death
        than Benedict IX, and provides the reasoning that Hans Staden died at approximately
        54 years old while Benedict IX died at approximately 44 years old.

        In fact, it explicitly states that Park Kyung-ni died at age 81 and Franz
        Xavier Wernz died at age 71, and that "81 is greater than 71." The NO answer
        is based on the fact that Park Kyung-ni was older (not younger) at death,
        not because they were the same age.

        NO answer appears to be in response to a question asking if Franz Xavier Wernz
        was older at death than Park Kyung-ni.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        and Franz Xavier Wernz died at age 71, and concludes that "Since 82 is greater
        than 71, Park Kyung-ni was NOT younger." The model is giving a NO answer because
        it found that one value is greater than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Park Kyung-ni was younger at her time of death than Franz Xavier
        Wernz. The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining that Park
        Kyung-ni died at 82 while Franz Xavier Wernz died at 71.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model clearly states that Conrad
        was approximately 64 years old at death while Pope was 56 years old at death.
        The model's reasoning is that Conrad was older than Pope (not equal to Pope),
        which is why Conrad was NOT younger than Pope.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Conrad was approximately
        64 years old at death while Pope was 56 years old at death, and concluded
        that Conrad was NOT younger than Pope at death.

        Horace Round died at age 74 while Richard Woodville died at approximately
        60-64 years old. The model explicitly states "74 years is greater than 60-64
        years" as the reason for its NO answer. The values being compared (74 vs.
        60-64) are clearly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether J. Horace Round was younger at his time of death than Richard Woodville.
        The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining that Round died
        at 74 years old while Woodville died at approximately 60-64 years old.

        Instead, it clearly indicates that Richard Woodville died at around 59-64
        years old while J. Horace Round died at 74 years old. The model concludes
        that Richard Woodville was younger at his time of death, which is why J. Horace
        Round was not younger. The NO answer is based on a difference in values, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - J. Horace Round

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that J.
        Horace Round was ~74 years old at death while Richard Woodville was ~64 years
        old at death. The model concludes "Since 74 is greater than 64, J. Horace
        Round was NOT younger at his time of death than Richard Woodville." The NO
        answer is based on Round being older (not the same age) at death.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that J. Horace Round was
        NOT younger at his time of death than Richard Woodville, after calculating
        that Round died at ~74 years old while Woodville died at ~64 years old.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether J. Horace Round was younger at his time of death
        than Richard Woodville. The model clearly concludes "Since 74 is greater than

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that "80 is greater
        than 68, so Wolfgang Clement was older at his time of death than Yi Chong-jun."
        The model identified a clear difference in ages (80 vs 68) as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Wolfgang Clement was older (80) at his time of death
        than Yi Chong-jun (68), directly answering the comparative question with a
        definitive negative.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that the values
        are different (Wolfgang Clement died at age 80 while Yi Chong-jun died at
        age 69) and concluded that Wolfgang Clement was older at death than Yi Chong-jun.
        The NO answer was based on this difference in ages, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after determining that Wolfgang Clement died at age 80 and Yi Chong-jun died
        at age 69, concluding that "Wolfgang Clement was older at his time of death
        than Yi Chong-jun." The model directly answers the comparative question with
        a definitive NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Wolfgang Clement
        was older at death (80 years) than Yi Chong-jun (69 years). The model identified
        a clear difference in values (80 vs 69 years) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly determined that Wolfgang Clement was NOT younger at his
        time of death than Yi Chong-jun, and provided this as a definitive comparative
        result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f885b73b-cb18-4a01-9d2d-0c14f7fed5d2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "Wolfgang Clement was older (80) than Yi
        Chong-jun (69) at their respective times of death." The model is noting a
        difference in values (80 vs 69), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Wolfgang Clement
        was not younger at his time of death than Yi Chong-jun at his time of death."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
