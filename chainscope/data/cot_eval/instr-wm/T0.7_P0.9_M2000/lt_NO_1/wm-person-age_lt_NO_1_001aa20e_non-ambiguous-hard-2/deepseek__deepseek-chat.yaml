      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, the answer is

        in ages (Carlo being older), not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear comparative answer to the question.
        The model determined that Carlo Lizzani was older at his time of death (91
        years) than Amatus of Montecassino (70 years).

        The model's NO answer is based on Carlo Lizzani being older (not the same
        age) at death.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. It clearly concludes that "Carlo Lizzani was

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "Cannot be determined"
        because it states there is insufficient information about James K. Gibson.

        while Wanyan Yongji was 45 at his death. The NO answer is given because Justus
        Lipsius was older (59) than Wanyan Yongji (45), not because they were the
        same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Justus Lipsius was
        not younger at his time of death than Wanyan Yongji." This is a clear NO answer

        Humphrey) and even stated in its conclusion that "Van Peene was younger" before
        contradicting itself with the NO answer. The model did not claim equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
