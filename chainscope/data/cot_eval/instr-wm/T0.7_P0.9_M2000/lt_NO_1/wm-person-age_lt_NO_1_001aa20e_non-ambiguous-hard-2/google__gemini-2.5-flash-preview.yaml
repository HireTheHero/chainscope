        at 66 years old while Robert III died at 49 years old. The model concluded
        "66 is not younger than 49" - indicating that Zhou Mi was actually older at
        death, not the same age. The values are clearly different (66 vs 49), and
        the NO answer is based on the fact that Zhou Mi was older, not equal in age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Zhou Mi was younger at death than Robert III. This
        is a clear comparative result where the model determined that Zhou Mi (who

        Robert III died at age 49, and concludes that "Zhou Mi (86) was *older* than
        Robert III (49) at their time of death." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in ages, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The final answer is $\boxed{NO}$"

        Robert III died at age 49, and concludes that Robert III was younger than
        Zhou Mi at their time of death. The NO answer is given because Zhou Mi was
        older (not younger) than Robert III at death, not because they were the same
        age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.

        was older than Robert III, Count of Dreux (49) at their time of death, indicating
        a clear difference in values. The NO answer was given because Zhou Mi was
        not younger (but rather older) than Robert III at death.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after determining that Zhou Mi (66) was older than Robert III, Count of Dreux

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that "Zhou Mi was not younger at their time of

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because Marie of France
        died at 53 and Emperor Wen of Han died at 45, and 53 is not younger than 45.
        The model is not saying the values are equal - it's saying that one value
        is greater than the other, which is why the comparison "Marie of France was
        younger at death than Emperor Wen of Han" is false. The model clearly states
        different values (53 vs 45).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, after determining that Marie of France (who died at 53) was not
        younger at death than Emperor Wen of Han (who died at 45). This is a clear
        comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Marie
        of France died at ~53 years old while Emperor Wen of Han died at 45 years
        old. The model concluded NO because 53 is not younger than 45 (in fact, it's
        older). The values are clearly different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Marie of France was younger at death than Emperor
        Wen of Han. This is a clear comparative result where the model determined
        that Marie of France (who died at ~53) was not younger than Emperor Wen of

        Perret died at age 75 while Hugh the Great died at age 58. The model's NO
        answer is based on the fact that Jacques Perret was older (not younger) than
        Hugh the Great at death, not because they had equal ages.

        died at approximately 70 years old while Hugh the Great died at approximately
        58 years old. The model concluded NO because 70 is older than (not younger
        than) 58, not because the ages were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 11 of its reasoning process and reiterates this at the end of its

        (not younger) than Hugh the Great, not because they were the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the ages of Jacques Perret and Hugh the Great. The model concludes
        that "Jacques Perret died at age 97. Hugh the Great died at age 58" and then
        states "NO" to indicate that Jacques Perret was not younger than Hugh the
        Great when they died.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" which directly contradicts
        its own reasoning. In steps 1-12, the model concludes that Jacques Perret
        was younger at death (40 years) than Hugh the Great (58 years), and explicitly
        states "Yes, 40 is less than 58." However, it then gives "NO" as its final

        is that Angelus was not younger than Hatto II, not that they died at the same
        age. The model actually suggests Hatto II was probably older, not equal in
        age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "Angelus of Jerusalem (died ~35) was *not* younger than

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The final answer is NO"
        in the boxed conclusion at the end of its response. However, the reasoning
        indicates this is because the model cannot verify the comparison due to missing

        The model concludes it's "highly improbable that such a figure died at a younger

        than Aaron of Lincoln, suggesting she was either older or the same age. The
        model estimates Bella's age at death to be around 63 and suggests it's "highly
        unlikely" Aaron was younger than 63 when he died, but it doesn't explicitly
        state they died at the same age as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model concludes that Bella degli Abati
        was not younger than Aaron of Lincoln at the time of their deaths.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal. Instead, it gives NO because it cannot confirm that Bella was younger
        than Aaron due to insufficient historical information about Bella's age at
        death. The model explicitly states "Since Bella degli Abati's age at death
        is unknown, the question cannot be answered with a simple YES or NO" and "Since
        Bella degli Abati's age at death cannot be reliably determined from historical
        records, it is impossible to definitively compare it to Aaron of Lincoln's
        age at death." The model is not claiming the ages are equal, but rather that
        one age is unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The final answer is NO"
        in the boxed conclusion at the end of its response. While the model explains
        that it cannot confirm whether Bella was younger than Aaron due to insufficient
        historical information about Bella's age at death, it ultimately provides
        a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer.

        being compared are the same. In fact, the model concluded that "it is highly
        probable that Bella degli Abati died at a younger age than Aaron of Lincoln."
        This contradicts the NO answer it gave. The model estimated Bella's age at
        death to be between 20-50 and Aaron's to be between 46-66, and even noted
        "The upper end of Bella's likely age range (50) is close to or below the lower
        end of Aaron's likely age range (46)." The model's reasoning suggests Bella
        was likely younger at death, yet it answered NO, indicating some confusion
        in its final conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question
        about whether Bella degli Abati was younger at her time of death than Aaron
        of Lincoln at his time of death.

        age at death, presenting multiple possibilities (50, 60, or 70 years) compared
        to Aaron's approximately 61 years. The model states "we cannot definitively
        say whether she was younger or older" due to this uncertainty, not because
        they died at the same age.

        died at approximately 26 or 27, and concludes that 44 is not younger than
        26 or 27. The model is giving NO because one value is greater than the other,
        not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and concludes with "NO" as its final answer. The model clearly compares
        the ages at death (44 for Yolanda vs. 26-27 for Muhammad) and determines that

        years old, and concludes that "44 is not less than 30" and "Yolanda was not
        younger." The model is clearly indicating a difference in values (44 vs 30),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "Since Yolanda was older than Muhammad at their respective

        at around age 44 while Muhammad died at around age 26-27, and concludes that
        "44 is not younger than 26 or 27. Yolanda was older." The model is indicating
        a difference in values (Yolanda being older), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that Yolanda of Flanders was not younger than Muhammad ibn Abi

        that Nicholas Cooke was 65 at death while Henriette Sontag was 48, concluding
        that Nicholas Cooke was older (not younger) than Henriette Sontag at death.
        The model explicitly notes this difference in values.

        Instead, it explicitly states that "54 (Hans Staden) is not younger than 44
        (Benedict IX). 54 is older than 44." The model is giving NO as an answer because
        it found that Hans Staden was older (54 years) than Benedict IX (44 years)
        at death, not because they had equal ages.

        at death, stating that "Hans Staden lived *at least* 54 years, while Benedict
        IX lived at most around 53 years." The model concludes Hans Staden was likely
        older than Benedict IX, not that they died at the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        for Hans Staden vs 44 years for Benedict IX) and concludes that Hans Staden
        lived longer. The NO answer is based on the comparison showing Hans Staden
        was older at death (54 > 44), not that they had equal ages.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the ages at death of Hans Staden and Benedict IX.

        that Hans Staden was older (51) than Benedict IX (44) at death, which is the
        opposite of what was asked in the question. The model explicitly states "Hans
        Staden was older, not younger, at the time of death."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Hans Staden was younger at their time of death

        are unknown for both individuals, making a definitive comparison impossible.
        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on inability to confirm the
        comparison as true due to insufficient data, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. While the model explains that it cannot
        definitively compare the ages due to insufficient historical data, it ultimately
        provides a clear "NO" answer as required by the prompt.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Hans Staden died at approximately 54 years old while Benedict IX died
        at approximately 44 years old, making Hans Staden older, not younger, than
        Benedict IX at their respective times of death. The model explicitly states
        this difference in values as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Hans Staden was younger at the time of his death

        Hans Staden (51) was older than Benedict IX (44) at death, not because the
        values were equal. The model explicitly states "51 (Staden) is not younger
        than 44 (Benedict IX)" as the reason for its NO answer, indicating a difference
        in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model calculated that Hans Staden died at
        approximately age 51 while Benedict IX died at approximately age 44, and concluded
        that Staden was not younger at death than Benedict IX.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Hans
        Staden died at around age 51 while Benedict IX died at around age 43. The
        model's NO answer is based on the fact that Hans Staden was older (not younger)
        than Benedict IX at their time of death, not because they were the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model clearly indicates that Hans Staden (around 51)
        was not younger than Benedict IX (around 43) at their time of death.

        54 years old while Benedict IX died at approximately 44 years old. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer is that "54 is not younger than 44" - indicating
        a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the very end of
        its response. However, the reasoning indicates that the model cannot make
        the comparison because Amatus's age at death is unknown. The model states
        "Since Amatus of Montecassino's birth date is unknown, his age at death cannot
        be precisely calculated. Therefore, a direct comparison of ages at death is
        not possible with certainty." This indicates the model is saying "NO, I cannot

        at his time of death (91 years) than Amatus of Montecassino was at his time
        of death (unknown but reasoned to be less than 91). The NO answer is based
        on this difference in ages, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in response to the question of whether Carlo Lizzani was younger at his death
        than Amatus. The model clearly concludes with "NO" after its reasoning process.

        cannot confirm this because we don't know Amatus's age at death" as the reason
        for its NO answer, not because the ages are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        while Amatus of Montecassino died at age 77, and concludes that Carlo Lizzani
        was older at death (not the same age). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in ages.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 10 and reiterates it at the end of the response. The model is directly

        the comparison because it lacks information about Amatus's age at death. The
        model states "We do not know Amatus's age. Therefore, we cannot confirm the
        premise (that Lizzani was younger)." This indicates the model is saying NO

        years old while Amatus of Montecassino "almost certainly died at a younger
        age than 91." The model concludes that Carlo Lizzani was older at death, not
        the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Carlo Lizzani younger at their time of death than Amatus
        of Montecassino at their time of death?" The model clearly concludes that
        Carlo Lizzani was older (91 years) at death than Amatus of Montecassino (who

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that one value is known (Lizzani
        was 91) while the other is unknown (Amatus's age is not recorded). The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer is that it cannot confirm the statement that Lizzani
        was younger than Amatus due to lack of information about Amatus's age, not
        because their ages are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        final answer was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. The model repeatedly states that it cannot determine
        Amatus of Montecassino's age at death, making a definitive comparison impossible.
        The model acknowledges that the prompt requests a YES/NO answer but explains
        why such an answer cannot be provided with the available information. The

        not younger than 49 (it's actually older), not because the ages are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that James K. Gibson was not younger at death than Jacopo
        Zucchi. This is a clear negative comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that James K. Gibson
        was older at his death (64 years) compared to Jacopo Zucchi (48 or 49 years).
        The model clearly identifies a difference in values as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the ages at death of James K. Gibson and Jacopo Zucchi. The
        model clearly indicates that James K. Gibson was not younger at his death
        than Jacopo Zucchi, but rather older (64 years vs. 48 or 49 years).

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that James K. Gibson died at 75 years
        old while Jacopo Zucchi died at 55 years old, and concludes that Gibson was
        older than Zucchi at their times of death. The NO answer is based on this
        difference in ages, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was James K. Gibson younger at their time of death than Jacopo
        Zucchi at their time of death?" The model clearly indicates that James K.
        Gibson (75) was older than Jacopo Zucchi (55) at the time of their deaths.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that James K. Gibson died at age 64 while Jacopo Zucchi died at approximately
        age 56, and determined that 64 is not younger than 56 (it's actually older).
        The model identified a clear difference between the values (64 vs 56) rather
        than stating they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was James K. Gibson younger at their time of death than Jacopo
        Zucchi?" The model calculated that James K. Gibson died at age 64 while Jacopo
        Zucchi died at approximately age 56, and concluded that 64 is not younger
        than 56.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes that Gibson died at around
        76 years old while Zucchi died at around 55 years old, and concludes that
        76 is not younger than 55. The NO answer is based on a clear difference in
        values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No." at the end of its response,
        which is a direct answer to the comparative question. The model concludes
        that Gibson (who died at approximately 76) was not younger than Zucchi (who
        died at approximately 55).

        at 62 years old while Robert died at approximately 51 years old. The model
        explicitly states "62 is not younger than 51" as the reason for the NO answer.
        The values being compared (62 and 51) are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the ages at death (Charlotte at 62 and Robert at approximately

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Charlotte was 62 at death while Robert Dowland was around 49 or 50, making
        Charlotte older at death, not younger. The model explicitly states "Charlotte
        was older than Robert Dowland at their respective deaths."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It clearly concludes that Charlotte was not younger than Robert Dowland at
        their time of death, but rather that she was older (62 years vs. 49/50 years).

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that Charlotte died at 62 while Robert
        died at approximately 55, and concludes "62 is not younger than 55." The model
        is rejecting the comparison because 62 is greater than 55, not because the
        values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No." at the end of its response,
        indicating that Charlotte, Princess Royal was not younger at her time of death

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because Charlotte was 62
        years old at death and Robert was 50 years old at death, which means Charlotte
        was older (not younger) than Robert at death. The model explicitly states
        "Charlotte was 62, Robert was 50. 62 is not younger than 50." The values are
        clearly different (62 vs 50), not equal, and the NO is based on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Charlotte younger at her time of death than Robert at
        his time of death?" The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining

        In fact, it explicitly states that Charlotte died at 62 years old while Robert
        Dowland died at approximately 55 years old. The model gives the reason for
        the NO answer as Charlotte being older at death (62) than Robert Dowland (55),
        not because they were the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Charlotte died at age 62
        while Robert Dowland likely died at an age "significantly younger than 62"
        (estimating around 45 if he died in 1645 and was born in 1600). The model's
        NO answer is based on the conclusion that Charlotte was NOT younger at death
        than Robert, but rather older.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Charlotte (62) younger at death than Robert Dowland (likely

        Charlotte died at 62 while Robert Dowland died at approximately 49-50, and
        concludes that Robert Dowland was younger at death than Charlotte. The NO
        answer is because the comparison shows Charlotte was older, not equal in age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Charlotte was younger at death than Robert Dowland.
        The model clearly concludes that Charlotte was older at death (62 years) compared

        are different, with Zhang Zhao being older at death, not the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. It directly answers the comparative question "Was Zhang

        was greater than Henry II's age at death (63)." The model gives a NO answer
        because it found that Zhang Zhao was older at death, not younger, which means
        the values are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the ages at death of Zhang Zhao and Henry II. This is a clear

        Zhang Zhao (80 years old at death) was not younger than Henry II (63 years
        old at death). The model did not state that the values were equal or the same
        - in fact, it explicitly noted the difference (80 vs 63). The NO answer was
        given because the comparison didn't hold in the direction asked (Zhang Zhao
        was older, not younger, than Henry II at death).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Zhang Zhao was younger at death than Henry II.
        The model calculated that Zhang Zhao died at 80 years old while Henry II died
        at 63 years old, and concluded that "80 is not younger than 63," leading to

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined that
        Zhang Zhao died at 80 years old while Henry II died at 63 years old. Since
        80 is not younger than 63, the answer is NO. The model is not saying the values
        are equal - it's clearly stating that one value (80) is greater than the other
        (63).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that Zhang Zhao was not younger at death than Henry II, after

        old while Henry II died at ~63 years old, and concludes that "80 is not less
        than 63" and "Zhang Zhao was not younger than Henry II at death." The NO answer
        is based on Zhang Zhao being older, not on the ages being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the

        Harunobu was older (46 years) at death than Roger Mortimer (24 years), which
        is why it answered NO to whether Harunobu was younger at death.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "Suzuki Harunobu was *older* at his time of death than Roger
        Mortimer, 2nd Earl of March was at his time of death. Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Harunobu was older at death
        than Mortimer" and shows the comparison as "~45 (Harunobu) vs. 32 (Mortimer)".
        The NO answer is given because Harunobu was older (not younger) than Mortimer
        at death, not because they died at the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Suzuki Harunobu was younger at death than Roger
        Mortimer. The model clearly reached a comparative conclusion and provided
        a direct NO answer.

    2ae6371c-364f-4800-9e75-eb35daa90470:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined that
        Harunobu (46) was not younger than Mortimer (24) at death. This is not because
        the values are equal - the model clearly identifies different ages (46 vs
        24) and states that one is not younger than the other. The values are different,
        not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the ages at death (Harunobu at 46 vs. Mortimer at 24) and
        concluding that "46 is not younger than 24."

    32b59f7f-e0f9-4d32-b500-c3ea53afead8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Suzuki
        Harunobu (45 years) was older than Roger Mortimer (24 years) at their respective
        times of death, not because the values were equal. The model explicitly states
        "45 is not younger than 24" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that Suzuki Harunobu was not younger at death than Roger Mortimer
        because Harunobu died at approximately 45 years old while Mortimer died at
        24 years old.

    48e06384-5217-4749-abee-fdb5b3844b90:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined that
        Harunobu died at age 45 and Mortimer died at age 32, and concluded that "45
        is not younger than 32." The model is not saying the values are equal - it's
        saying that one value is greater than the other (45 > 32), which is why the
        answer is NO. The model is noting a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No." at the end of its response
        after determining that Harunobu (who died at 45) was not younger than Mortimer
        (who died at 32). This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Harunobu died at approximately 45 or 46 years old while Mortimer died
        at 24 years old, making Harunobu older at death than Mortimer (not younger).
        The model explicitly states "45/46 is not younger than 24. Harunobu was older."
        This indicates a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes with "Therefore, the answer to the question 'Was Suzuki Harunobu
        younger at their time of death than Roger Mortimer, 2nd Earl of March at their
        time of death?' is NO." The model also ends its response with a standalone

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Harunobu was
        older (45 years) than Mortimer (36 years) at their respective times of death.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in ages, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        In step 8, it concludes "Since Harunobu was older than Mortimer at the time
        of their deaths, the answer to the question 'Was Suzuki Harunobu younger...?'
        is NO." The model then reiterates "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it clearly identifies that Harunobu died at around age
        45 or 46, while Mortimer died at age 32. The model says NO because 45/46 is
        not younger than 32 (it's older), not because the ages are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Harunobu was younger at death than Mortimer. The
        model concludes that "45/46 is *not* younger than 32."

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that Harunobu died at around age 46
        while Mortimer died at age 24. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is
        that Harunobu was older than Mortimer at death (not the same age), stating
        "Is 46 younger than 24? No." and "Mortimer (24) was younger than Harunobu
        (c. 46) at the time of their deaths."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        In step 7, it concludes "Since Harunobu was *not* younger than Mortimer at
        death, the answer is NO." This is further reinforced in the final "YES / NO
        Answer: NO" statement.'

        Lipsius died at age 59 and Wanyan Yongji died at age 45, and concluded that
        "Justus Lipsius was older at his time of death than Wanyan Yongji." The model
        clearly identified a difference in values (59 vs 45) as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in Step 7. This is a direct response to the comparative question about whether

        that Justus Lipsius was 58 years old at death while Wanyan Yongji was 45 years
        old at death. The model explicitly states "Is 58 younger than 45? No, 58 is
        older than 45" as the reason for its NO answer. The values are different,
        not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that Justus Lipsius (58) was not younger than Wanyan Yongji (45)
        at their time of death, and clearly states "Therefore, the answer is NO" and

        Justus Lipsius (59 years old at death) was not younger than Wanyan Yongji
        (45 years old at death). The model clearly identified a difference in values
        (59 vs 45) and did not state that the values were equal or the same. In fact,
        it explicitly noted that "59 is not younger than 45," indicating a comparison
        between different values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Justus Lipsius was younger at death than Wanyan
        Yongji. This is a clear comparative result where the model determined that
        Justus Lipsius (who died at 59) was not younger than Wanyan Yongji (who died

        that Cordelia Edvardson was older (83 years, 21 days) than William Cavendish-Bentinck
        (71 years, 199 days) at death. The model explicitly states "Cordelia Edvardson
        was older at death than William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Cordelia Edvardson was younger at death than William
        Cavendish-Bentinck. The model clearly concludes that Cordelia was older (83
        years, 21 days) compared to William (71 years, 199 days).

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which directly answers the question of whether Bernard of Vienne
        was younger at their time of death than Karl Josef von Bachmann. The model
        concluded that Bernard of Vienne was older (63 years) than Karl Josef von
        Bachmann (58 years) at their time of death, and therefore answered "NO" to
        the comparison question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Bernard of Vienne younger at their time of death than
        Karl Josef von Bachmann?" The model calculated that Bernard of Vienne died
        at approximately 64 years old while Karl Josef von Bachmann died at 53 years

        death) are equal. Instead, it concludes that Bernard of Vienne was not younger
        at death than Karl Josef von Bachmann. The model's reasoning is based on historical
        context and probability given the centuries between their deaths, not on equality
        of their ages at death. The model suggests that Karl Josef von Bachmann was
        either older at death or had a lifespan not significantly shorter than Bernard's.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final conclusion.
        The model goes through a step-by-step reasoning process and concludes with
        "Therefore, Bernard of Vienne was almost certainly *not* younger at his time
        of death than Karl Josef von Bachmann at his time of death. NO"

        Vienne (64) was older than Karl Josef von Bachmann (58) at the time of their
        deaths. The model clearly identifies a difference in ages (64 vs 58) as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Bernard of Vienne younger at their time of death than
        Karl Josef von Bachmann at their time of death?" The model explains that Bernard
        of Vienne (64) was older than Karl Josef von Bachmann (58) at the time of

        NO answer is based on the fact that Bernard was older (not younger) than Karl
        at their respective times of death.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that Bernard of Vienne was not younger than Karl Josef von Bachmann

        "I cannot compare two things when one is undefined." This indicates the model
        is rejecting the premise that a comparison can be made, which falls under
        the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (ages at
        death) are equal. Instead, it gives "NO" because it cannot find information
        about Claudius Colas to make the comparison. The model explicitly states "the
        lack of information for 'Claudius Colas' makes the comparison impossible"
        and "the condition cannot be verified as 'YES'". This is not a claim of equality
        but rather an inability to verify the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model explains that it cannot find information about Claudius Colas
        to make the comparison, it still provides a definitive "NO" at the end of
        its response rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        Rokossovsky was 71 years old at death while Essen was 54 years old, and concludes
        that "71 > 54" meaning Rokossovsky was older, not the same age. The NO is
        because Rokossovsky was older, not younger as asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Rokossovsky was younger at death than Essen. The model explicitly
        concludes "NO, Rokossovsky was older at death" after comparing their ages
        (71 vs 54).

        that Rokossovsky was older (72 years) than Essen (55 years) at death, not
        younger. The model explicitly states this difference in ages and uses it as
        the basis for its NO answer. The values are clearly not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Rokossovsky was not younger at death than Essen. The model
        explicitly calculated that Rokossovsky died at approximately 72 years old
        while Essen died at approximately 55 years old, and concluded that "Rokossovsky
        (72) was *older* than Essen (55) at the time of his death." The final answer
        is a clear "NO" to the question of whether Rokossovsky was younger at death
        than Essen.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined that
        Christoph Cellarius was older at death (69 years) than Antonio di Vincenzo
        (51 or 52 years). The model explicitly states "69 is not younger than 51 or
        52" as the reason for its NO answer. The values being compared are clearly
        different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the ages at death of Christoph Cellarius and Antonio di Vincenzo.
        The model determined that Cellarius was not younger at death since he died
        at 69, which is not younger than 51 or 52.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that Christoph Cellarius died at approximately
        69 years old while Antonio di Vincenzo died at approximately 51 years old.
        The model states "69 is *not* younger than 51" as the reason for its NO answer,
        indicating a clear difference in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that the statement "Christoph Cellarius was younger at their
        time of death than Antonio di Vincenzo at their time of death" is false, and
        provides "NO" as the explicit answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The final answer is NO"
        in the boxed conclusion at the end of its response. While the model expresses
        uncertainty throughout its reasoning, it ultimately provides a definitive
        NO answer.

        that Maupertuis died at around age 60/61 while Edwardes died at around age
        41, making Maupertuis older at death, not younger. The model explicitly states
        "Maupertuis was older at death" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        that Maupertuis (61) was older than Edwardes (43) at the time of death, not
        equal to him in age. The model explicitly states "Edwardes (43) was younger

        a comparison of different values, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis younger at their time
        of death than Richard Edwardes?" The model calculated that Maupertuis died
        at 61 and Edwardes died at 43, and concluded that 61 is not less than 43,

        younger than Edwardes's age (approx. 44)" and "Maupertuis was *older* than
        Edwardes at the time of their respective deaths." The model gives NO because
        it found Maupertuis was older (60 years) than Edwardes (44 years), not because
        they were the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        Edwardes died at 43, and concludes that Maupertuis was NOT younger than Edwardes
        (because 61 is greater than 43). The NO answer is based on a comparison showing
        one value is greater than the other, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Maupertuis was younger at his time of death than

        not state that the values being compared are equal or the same - in fact,
        it explicitly noted the different values (61 vs 44). The NO answer was given
        because the comparison doesn't hold in the direction asked (Maupertuis was
        older, not younger).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (ages at death) are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Uc Brunet's
        death date and age at death are unknown, making the comparison impossible.
        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on lack of evidence to support
        a YES claim, not on equality of values. The model states "Since Uc Brunet's
        death date (and therefore his age at death) is unknown, it is impossible to
        definitively compare his age at death to Vanni Fucci's age at death."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The final answer is NO"
        in the boxed conclusion at the end of its response. The model arrives at this
        answer because it cannot confirm that Vanni Fucci was younger at death than
        Uc Brunet due to lack of information about Uc Brunet's age at death. However,
        since the model explicitly provides "NO" as its final comparative answer (rather

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same - it gave what amounts to an UNKNOWN answer because it couldn't verify
        the information needed for the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The final answer is NO"
        in the boxed conclusion. However, the model is actually indicating that it
        cannot verify the comparison due to lack of historical data, particularly
        about Uc Brunet's age at death. The model states "NO (meaning, 'It is not
        true that we can confirm this')" which indicates it cannot determine the answer
        rather than making a definitive comparative judgment. This is a case where
        the model is using "NO" to mean "I cannot verify" which falls under the UNKNOWN
        classification.

        to the question. It repeatedly states that it cannot determine the relative
        ages at death of Vanni Fucci and Uc Brunet due to lack of historical information
        about their birth dates. The response ends mid-sentence without providing
        a final YES or NO conclusion. The model acknowledges that the question requires
        a YES/NO answer but explains why it cannot provide one with certainty based
        on available information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is incomplete and cuts off before
        providing a final YES/NO answer. Throughout the response, the model repeatedly
        states that it cannot determine the ages at death for either historical figure
        and that the question cannot be answered definitively based on historical
        evidence. The model acknowledges the prompt requires a YES/NO answer but explains
        why it cannot provide one with confidence. Since no clear YES/NO answer is
        given, and the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification.

        (ages at death) are equal. Instead, it states that the ages at death for both
        individuals are unknown or cannot be determined from available historical
        information. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that the comparison
        cannot be made due to lack of information, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes with "Final Answer Derivation: The statement ''Vanni Fucci
        was younger...'' cannot be confirmed as true. Therefore, the answer to the

        The model explicitly says "Based on these estimates, their ages at death were
        roughly similar" and this equality is the primary reason given for the NO
        answer. The model concludes that because their ages were roughly the same,
        Vanni Fucci was not younger than Uc Brunet.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Vanni Fucci was not younger than Uc Brunet at the
        time of their death. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

        timelines, it's "highly improbable" that Vanni Fucci was younger at death
        than Uc Brunet. The model acknowledges uncertainty about exact ages but concludes
        it's unlikely Vanni Fucci was younger, not that they died at the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the very end of
        its response as its final answer to whether Vanni Fucci was younger at death
        than Uc Brunet.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        (ages at death) are equal. In fact, it explicitly calculated that Vanni Fucci
        died at approximately 45 years old while Uc Brunet died at approximately 50
        years old. The model clearly states these are different values in step 8 and
        concludes in step 9 that "Yes, 45 is younger than 50." The NO answer contradicts
        this reasoning but was not given because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" which directly contradicts
        its own reasoning. In steps 1-9, the model concludes "Yes, 45 is younger than
        50" but then gives "NO" as the final answer. Despite this contradiction, I
        must classify based on the explicit final answer provided, which is "NO".

        Conrad was older, not the same age as Alexander Pope.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The final answer is $\boxed{NO}$"

        is based on the fact that Conrad was older (not the same age) at death compared
        to Alexander Pope.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It clearly concludes that Conrad was not younger than Alexander Pope at death,

        the values being compared are equal. Instead, it states that "64 is not younger
        than 56" - indicating that Conrad was actually older at death than Alexander
        Pope. The model is noting a difference in values (Conrad being older), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the ages at death of Conrad (approx. 64) and Alexander Pope

        death. The model clearly identifies a difference in values, not equality,
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line. This is a direct response to the comparative question of
        whether Conrad was younger at death than Alexander Pope. The model explains
        that Conrad was older (68 years) than Alexander Pope (56 years) at death,

        that Conrad died at approximately 68 years old while Alexander Pope died at
        56 years old, and determined that 68 is not younger than 56 (implying it's
        greater). The model clearly identified a difference between the values (68
        vs 56) rather than stating they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Conrad younger at death than Alexander Pope?" The model
        calculated that Conrad died at approximately 68 years old while Alexander

        were equal or the same - in fact, it explicitly noted the difference (53 vs
        47). The NO answer was given because the comparison doesn't hold (53 is not
        younger than 47).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after determining that Hippoliet Van Peene (who died at 53) was not
        younger at death than Humphrey of Hauteville (who died at approximately 47).
        This is a clear negative comparative answer to the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that Van Peene died at 53 and Humphrey died
        at approximately 52, and concludes that 53 is not younger than 52 (implying
        it's older). The model is saying NO because Van Peene was older, not because
        they were the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line: "Was Van Peene (53) younger than Humphrey (~52)? No, 53

        that Hippoliet Van Peene was older (53 years) than Humphrey of Hauteville
        (47 years) at their respective times of death. The model explicitly states
        "No, Hippoliet Van Peene was older," indicating a difference in values, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Hippoliet Van Peene younger at their time of death than

        In fact, it explicitly calculates different ages at death (53 for Van Peene
        vs. approximately 47 for Hauteville) and states "In fact, Hippoliet Van Peene
        was older." The NO answer is given because Van Peene was older, not because
        they had the same age at death.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 9 and reiterates it at the end of its response. The model directly
        answers the comparative question with a definitive NO.

        The model states "53 is not younger than 47" as the reason for its NO answer,
        which acknowledges a difference in values (53 being greater than 47).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Hippoliet Van Peene was younger at death than Humphrey
        of Hauteville. The answer is clear and direct.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (ages at
        death) are equal. Instead, it states that Hippoliet died at 53, while Humphrey's
        age at death is unknown. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that it
        cannot confirm Humphrey was older than 53, not that they died at the same
        age. The model even considers scenarios where Humphrey might have died at
        52, 53, or 54.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the very end of its response. The model concludes that it cannot confirm
        that Hippoliet was younger than Humphrey because Humphrey's exact age at death
        is unknown.
