      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (their ages at death) are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer
        on the fact that Bella died almost 700 years before Aaron, which is a temporal
        relationship rather than an equality statement about their ages at death.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Bella degli Abati

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values; it simply couldn't
        make the comparison due to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "we cannot answer this question

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is contradictory and unclear.
        It first calculates that both Charlotte and Robert were 34 years old at death
        and concludes they were the same age. But then it states "we cannot answer
        this question with a YES or NO answer, as the passage does not provide enough
        information to determine the age of either person." This directly contradicts
        its own calculation. Since the model doesn't provide a clear YES or NO answer

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we cannot give a YES

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific reason for the NO answer
        - that Cordelia Edvardson was older than William Cavendish-Bentinck at their
        time of death. The model is making a comparison that indicates a difference
        in ages, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model is making a clear negative comparison,

        (their ages at death) are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different
        reason for the NO answer - that Cordelia Edvardson died 5 years after William
        Cavendish-Bentinck, which would make a comparison of "younger at time of death"
        impossible in the way described.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Cordelia Edvardson
        was not younger at their time of death than William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd
        Duke of Portland." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        The model is actually making a logical error in its reasoning (since someone

        does not provide specific dates of Park Kyung-ni and Franz Xavier Wernz's
        deaths, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context." This
