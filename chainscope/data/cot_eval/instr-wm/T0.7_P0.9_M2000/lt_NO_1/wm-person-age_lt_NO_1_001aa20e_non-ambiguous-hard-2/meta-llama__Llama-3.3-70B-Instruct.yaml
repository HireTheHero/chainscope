      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that Zhou Mi died at 66 years old
        while Robert III died at 49 years old, and uses this difference as the basis
        for its NO answer. The model concludes that Robert III was younger at his
        time of death compared to Zhou Mi.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Zhou Mi was younger at his time of death than Robert III. The model
        concludes that since Zhou Mi died at 66 and Robert III died at 49, Zhou Mi
        was not younger at his time of death.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because Zhou Mi (66 years
        old at death) was older than Robert III (49 years old at death), not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly calculated different ages at death
        and based its NO answer on Zhou Mi being older, not the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is NO" after determining that Zhou Mi died at 66 years old while
        Robert III died at 49 years old.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Zhou Mi was older at death (66 years) than Robert III (49 years). The
        model explicitly states the values are different (66 vs 49) and this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Zhou Mi was younger at their time of death than Robert III. The
        model calculated that Zhou Mi died at 66 years old while Robert III died at
        49 years old, and concluded that since 66 is greater than 49, the answer is
        "NO".

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Zhou Mi was 66 years old when
        he died" while "Robert III, Count of Dreux, was 44 years old when he died"
        and concludes that "Since 66 is greater than 44, Zhou Mi was not younger than
        Robert III." The model is clearly indicating a difference in values (66 vs
        44) as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: **NO**"
        as its final answer. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question
        of whether Zhou Mi was younger at the time of death than Robert III.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly calculates that Zhou Mi lived to be either
        66 or 76 years old, while Robert III lived to be 49 years old. The model concludes
        "NO" because Zhou Mi was older at death than Robert III, not because they
        had equal ages at death.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Zhou Mi died at age 66 while
        Robert III died at age 49, and concludes that "Since 66 is greater than 49,
        Zhou Mi was not younger than Robert III." The NO answer is based on Zhou Mi
        being older, not on the ages being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: **NO**"
        at the end of its response, indicating that Zhou Mi was not younger than Robert

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Zhou Mi was 66 years old at death while Robert III was 49 years old at
        death, meaning Zhou Mi was older (not younger) than Robert III at death. The
        model explicitly noted this difference in values as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Zhou Mi was younger at their time of death than
        Robert III, Count of Dreux. The model calculated that Zhou Mi was 66 years
        old at death while Robert III was 49 years old at death, and concluded that
        Zhou Mi was older, not younger, at the time of death.

    e58bb0bd-4240-45ad-8d54-7a39aab740fa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly calculates that Zhou Mi was 66 years old at death while
        Robert III was 49 years old at death, and states that "since 49 is less than
        66, Robert III, Count of Dreux was younger at the time of his death than Zhou
        Mi." The NO answer is based on this difference in ages, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question 'Was Zhou Mi younger at their time of death than Robert III,
        Count of Dreux at their time of death?' is **NO**." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Zhou Mi was older at death (66 years) than Robert III (49 years). The
        model explicitly states "Since 66 is greater than 49, Zhou Mi was not younger
        at their time of death than Robert III, Count of Dreux." This indicates a
        difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Zhou Mi was younger at their time of death than Robert III, Count
        of Dreux. The model calculated that Zhou Mi died at 66 years old while Robert
        III died at 49 years old, and concluded that since 66 is greater than 49,
        Zhou Mi was not younger at death.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Marie of France died at 53 while
        Emperor Wen of Han died at either 45 or 46, and concludes that "Marie was
        older at the time of her death than Emperor Wen of Han at the time of his
        death." The model is giving a NO answer because it found a difference in values,
        not because they are the same.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Marie died at age 53 while Emperor Wen died at age 46, meaning Marie
        was older at death (not younger as the question asked). The model explicitly
        states the values are different (53 vs 46), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Marie of France was younger at her time of death
        than Emperor Wen of Han. The model clearly concludes that Marie died at 53
        while Emperor Wen died at 46, and since 53 is greater than 46, Marie was not
        younger at death.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it calculates that Marie of France was approximately 53 years old
        at death while Emperor Wen of Han was approximately 45 or 46 years old. The
        model concludes that Marie was older at death than Emperor Wen, which is why
        it answers NO to whether Marie was younger. This is based on a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer to whether
        Marie of France was younger at their time of death than Emperor Wen of Han

        old at death while Emperor Wen was either 45 or 46 years old. The model concludes
        "NO" because Marie was older (53 > 45/46), not because they were the same

        lived to approximately 53 years while Emperor Wen of Han lived to approximately
        45 or 46 years. The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Marie's age
        (53) is greater than Emperor Wen's age (45 or 46), not because they were the
        same age.

        Marie's age at death (52/53) is greater than Emperor Wen's age at death (45/46).
        The NO answer is based on this difference in ages, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Jacques Perret died at 91 years old while Hugh the Great died at 58 years
        old, and since 91 is greater than 58 (not equal), Jacques Perret was not younger
        at death than Hugh the Great.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Jacques Perret was younger at the time of his death
        than Hugh the Great at the time of his death. The model calculated that Jacques
        Perret died at 91 years old while Hugh the Great died at 58 years old, and
        concluded that since 91 is greater than 58, the answer is "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly calculates that Jacques Perret was approximately 67
        years old at death while Hugh the Great was approximately 56 years old at
        death. The model concludes that "Jacques Perret was older at the time of his
        death than Hugh the Great at his time of death" which is why it answers NO
        to whether Jacques Perret was younger. The NO is based on a difference in
        values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer to the question
        ''Was Jacques Perret younger at their time of death than Hugh the Great at

        In fact, it clearly states that Jacques Perret died at 86 while Hugh the Great
        died at 58, and concludes that "Hugh the Great was younger at the time of
        his death than Jacques Perret." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in ages, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Jacques Perret died at age 91
        while Hugh the Great died at approximately age 58, and concludes "Since 91
        is greater than 58, Jacques Perret was not younger at their time of death
        than Hugh the Great." The NO answer is based on Jacques Perret being older
        (not the same age).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at

        that "Since 91 is greater than 58, Jacques Perret was older at the time of
        his death than Hugh the Great." The NO answer is based on this inequality,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to whether Jacques Perret was younger at the time of death than Hugh the Great

        on the inability to verify the claim due to missing information, not because
        the ages are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. While the model acknowledges it lacks information about Jacques
        Perret, it still provides a definitive "NO" as its final answer rather than
        refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine the answer.

        that Carlo Lizzani was older at death (91 years) than Amatus of Montecassino
        (approximately 70 years). The model explicitly states "Since 91 is greater
        than 70, Carlo Lizzani was older at the time of his death than Amatus of Montecassino."
        This indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Carlo Lizzani was younger at the time of death
        than Amatus of Montecassino. The model calculated that Carlo Lizzani was 91
        years old at death while Amatus was approximately 70 years old, and concluded
        that since 91 is greater than 70, the answer is "NO".

        In fact, it explicitly calculates that Bridget of Sweden was 70 years old
        at death while Dirck Helmbreker was approximately 65 years old. The model
        states "Since 70 is greater than 65, Bridget of Sweden was not younger than
        Dirck Helmbreker at the time of death." The NO answer is based on Bridget
        being older, not the same age.

        Instead, it clearly indicates that Bridget of Sweden was 70 years old at death

        claims the ages are equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on
        its estimation that "Vanni Fucci might have been around the same age or slightly
        older than Uc Brunet at the time of their deaths." While it mentions they
        might be "around the same age," it also states Vanni Fucci might have been
        "slightly older," which indicates a difference rather than exact equality.
        The model is not asserting they died at exactly the same age as the primary
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Vanni Fucci was younger at their time of death than Uc Brunet.

        who was younger at the time of death based solely on widely available historical
        data." The NO appears to be based on inability to verify the comparison rather
        than on equality of values.

        died at approximately 64, and concluded that since 64 is less than 70, J.
        Horace Round was NOT younger at death.
