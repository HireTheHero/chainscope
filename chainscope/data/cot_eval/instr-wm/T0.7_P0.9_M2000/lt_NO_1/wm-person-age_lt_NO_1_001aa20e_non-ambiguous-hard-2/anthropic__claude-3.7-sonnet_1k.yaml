        The NO answer was given because the model determined that Robert III was younger
        at death than Zhou Mi, not because they died at the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear negative answer to the question of whether Zhou

        while Robert III died at 49 years old, and concludes that Robert III was younger
        at his time of death. The NO answer is given because Zhou Mi was older (not
        younger) at his time of death than Robert III, not because their ages were
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Zhou Mi was not younger

        died at age 49, and concludes that "Zhou Mi was older (not younger) at his
        time of death compared to Robert III." The NO answer is based on a difference
        in values (66 > 49), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Zhou Mi was not younger
        at his time of death than Robert III, Count of Dreux." This is a clear negative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Marie of France was approximately
        53 years old at death while Emperor Wen of Han was approximately 45 years
        old at death. The model concludes "Since 53 is greater than 45, Marie of France
        was older at her time of death than Emperor Wen of Han was at his time of
        death." The NO answer is based on Marie being older, not on equal ages.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        Wen died at age 45 while Marie died at age 53, not because the values were
        equal. The model explicitly notes this difference in ages and bases its NO
        answer on the fact that Emperor Wen was younger at death than Marie, not the
        same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Marie of France was younger at her time of death
        than Emperor Wen of Han. The model concludes that Emperor Wen died at a younger

        at death (45) than Marie (52-53), not because they died at the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly indicates that Marie was not

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined that
        Marie of France died at age 53 while Emperor Wen of Han died at age 45, and
        since 53 is greater than 45, Marie was NOT younger. The model is not saying
        the values are equal; it's explicitly stating they are different (53 vs 45)
        and that's why the answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Marie of France was NOT younger at her time of death than
        Emperor Wen of Han. The model provides a direct and explicit negative answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Marie lived to be 53 years old
        while Emperor Wen died at 45 years old, showing a clear difference in their
        ages at death. The NO answer is given because Marie was older (not younger)
        than Emperor Wen at death, not because they died at the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Marie of France died younger than Emperor Wen of Han. The model
        clearly concludes "Since Marie was 53 at death and Emperor Wen was 45 at death,
        Marie was NOT younger at her time of death. NO"

        Marie of France died at about 53 years old while Emperor Wen of Han died at
        about 45 years old. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that Marie
        lived longer (was older at death), not that they died at the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Marie of France was younger at her time of death than Emperor Wen
        of Han. The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining that Marie
        died at 53 while Emperor Wen died at 45.

        and 91 respectively). The model is stating there's a difference in values,
        with Hugh dying younger than Jacques Perret, which is why it answered NO to
        whether Jacques Perret died younger.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Jacques Perret (either

        was approximately 45 years old at death while Roger Mortimer was approximately
        32 years old at death. The model concludes "NO" because 45 is greater than
        32, not because the ages were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Suzuki Harunobu was NOT younger at their time of

        was 64 years old at death. The model explicitly states "Since 58 is less than
        64, Karl Josef von Bachmann was younger at his time of death than Bernard
        of Vienne." This indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model is saying that Karl Josef von Bachmann was NOT older than Bernard of
        Vienne at death (which aligns with its reasoning that Karl Josef von Bachmann
        was younger at 58 years compared to Bernard of Vienne at 64 years).

        that Bernard of Vienne was older (64 years) than Karl Josef von Bachmann (58
        years) at death, which directly contradicts the premise of the question asking
        if Bernard was younger. The model clearly identified a difference in values
        (64 vs 58), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        Karl Josef von Bachmann. The model calculated that Bernard was approximately
        64 years old at death while Karl Josef von Bachmann was approximately 58 years
        old at death, and concluded that Bernard was older, not younger.

        Instead, it clearly indicates that Ptolemy XIV died at around 15 years old
        while Muhammad al-Jawad died at around 25 years old, and concludes that Ptolemy
        XIV was younger at death. The NO answer is based on this difference in ages,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Muhammad al-Jawad
        was not younger at death than Ptolemy XIV)" as its final answer. This is a
        clear NO response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Petrus Armengol died at approximately
        66 years of age while Alonso de Ojeda died at approximately 49 years of age,
        and concludes that since 66 > 49, Petrus was NOT younger. The NO answer is
        based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. It clearly concludes that "Petrus Armengol was NOT younger than
        Alonso de Ojeda at their respective times of death" and provides a final "NO"
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly states that Petrus Armengol died at approximately
        66 years old while Alonso de Ojeda died at approximately 49 years old. The
        model's NO answer is based on the fact that Petrus Armengol was older (66
        > 49), not that they were the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Petrus Armengol was NOT younger at his time of death
        than Alonso de Ojeda. The model provides a clear comparative answer.

        when he died, while Alonso de Ojeda was about 49 when he died. The model's
        NO answer is based on the fact that Petrus Armengol was older (not younger)
        at death than Alonso de Ojeda, not because they were the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Petrus Armengol was younger at their time of death than Alonso
        de Ojeda. The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after comparing their ages
        (66 vs 49).

        that Park Kyung-ni died at 81 years old while Franz Xavier Wernz died at 71
        years old, and since 81 is greater than 71, Park Kyung-ni was older (not younger)
        than Franz Xavier Wernz at death. The model explicitly notes this difference
        in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Park Kyung-ni younger at their time of death than Franz
        Xavier Wernz at their time of death?" The model clearly indicates that Park
        Kyung-ni was older (not younger) than Franz Xavier Wernz at the time of their

        compared to Franz Xavier Wernz. The model calculated that Park Kyung-ni died
        at 81 years old while Franz Xavier Wernz died at 71 years old, and concluded

        This is a case where the model is stating it cannot determine the answer due
        to lack of information about one of the subjects (Yong Li). The model is not

        This is a case where the model is saying "NO" but is actually indicating it
        cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information about one of the
        subjects (Yong Li). According to the criteria, when a model says "NO, I cannot

        Wolfgang Clement was older (not younger) at his time of death. The model explicitly
        notes this difference in values as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Wolfgang Clement was younger at his time of death
        than Yi Chong-jun. The model clearly concludes: "Since Wolfgang Clement lived
        to be 80 while Yi Chong-jun lived to be 69, Wolfgang Clement was NOT younger
        at his time of death. NO"'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        values being compared are different, not the same. It explicitly states that
        "Wolfgang Clement died at 80 years old, while Yi Chong-jun died at 69 years
        old" and "Since 80 is greater than 69, Wolfgang Clement was older at his time
        of death than Yi Chong-jun was at his time of death." The model is clearly
        indicating a difference in values (80 vs 69), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" to the question of
        whether Yi Chong-jun was older at his time of death than Wolfgang Clement.
        The model clearly states that "Wolfgang Clement died at 80 years old, while
        Yi Chong-jun died at 69 years old" and concludes with "NO" as its final answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Wolfgang Clement was 80 years
        old at death while Yi Chong-jun was 69 years old, and concludes that "Wolfgang
        Clement was older at death than Yi Chong-jun, not younger." The NO answer
        is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Wolfgang Clement was not younger at death than Yi
        Chong-jun. The model clearly provides a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Wolfgang Clement died at age
        80 while Yi Chong-jun died at age 69, and concludes that 80 is greater than
        69. The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that Wolfgang Clement was 80 years
        old at death while Yi Chong-jun was 69 years old at death. The model's NO
        answer is based on Wolfgang Clement being older (not the same age) at death
        compared to Yi Chong-jun.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Wolfgang Clement was younger at his time of death than Yi Chong-jun.
        The model clearly concludes "Wolfgang Clement was NOT younger at time of death"
        and ends with "NO".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Wolfgang
        Clement died at 80 years old while Yi Chong-jun died at 69 years old, and
        concludes that Wolfgang Clement was NOT younger because 80 is greater than
        69. The model clearly identifies a difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Wolfgang Clement was NOT younger than Yi Chong-jun
        at their time of death. The model provides a clear comparative answer.

        are equal. Instead, it clearly states that Wolfgang Clement was 80 years old
        at death while Yi Chong-jun was 69 years old, and concludes that Wolfgang
        Clement was NOT younger because he was older (80 > 69). The NO answer is based
        on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Wolfgang Clement was NOT younger at their time of
        death than Yi Chong-jun. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
