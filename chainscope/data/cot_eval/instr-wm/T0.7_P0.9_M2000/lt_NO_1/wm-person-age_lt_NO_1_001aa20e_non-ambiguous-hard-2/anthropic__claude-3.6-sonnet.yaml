      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Marie of France was 53 years
        old when she died while Emperor Wen was 45 years old when he died, and it
        notes that "53 is greater than 45." The NO answer is based on Marie being
        older (not the same age) at death.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Marie of France was younger at her time of death than Emperor Wen.
        The model clearly concludes with "Therefore, Marie of France was NOT younger
        at her time of death than Emperor Wen. NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Marie of France died at age
        52/53 while Emperor Wen died at age 45/46, and it concludes that "52/53 is
        greater than 45/46." The NO answer is based on Marie being older at death,
        not on equal ages.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Marie of France was younger at her time of death than Emperor Wen.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that Marie of France died at 53 while
        Emperor Wen died at 45, and states "53 is greater than 45" as the reason for
        its NO answer. The model is indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Marie of France was NOT younger at her time of death than
        Emperor Wen. This is a clear comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Marie of France died at 52-53 years old while Emperor Wen died at 45-46
        years old, and it explicitly states "52-53 is greater than 45-46" as the reason
        for its NO answer. The model is noting a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Marie of France was younger at her time of death than Emperor Wen.
        The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining that Marie of France
        died at 52-53 years old while Emperor Wen died at 45-46 years old.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Marie died at age 53 while Emperor Wen died at age 45, and since 53 >
        45, Marie was older at death, not younger. The model explicitly notes this
        difference in values as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Marie was younger at death than Emperor Wen. The
        model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining that Marie died at
        53 while Emperor Wen died at 45, making her older at death, not younger.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Jacques Perret died at 79 years
        old while Hugh the Great died at 58 years old, and concludes that "79 is greater
        than 58." The NO answer is based on this inequality (Jacques being older,
        not younger), not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Jacques Perret was
        not younger at his time of death than Hugh the Great" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and explains that it lacks sufficient information
        about Jacques Perret's age at death to make a comparison. The model is clearly
        indicating it cannot determine the answer to the question.

        False. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather
        refused to make the comparison due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO ANSWER - There isn't
        enough information to make this comparison with confidence." This indicates
        the model is refusing to provide a definitive YES or NO answer due to insufficient
        information. The model acknowledges it doesn't have reliable information about
        Jacques Perret's age at death to make the comparison.

        to answer. The model did not claim the values being compared are the same;
        instead, it stated it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "I must abstain from giving a YES/NO answer as doing
        so would be speculative without complete information." The model is refusing

        question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are the
        same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I should not give a YES/NO
        answer when I cannot be confident about the underlying facts needed for the
        comparison." The model acknowledges uncertainty about the birth and death
        dates of the individuals being compared and refuses to provide a definitive

        (44 years old) was older than Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr (27 years old) at their
        respective times of death. The model did not state that the values were equal
        or the same - it explicitly noted that "44 is greater than 27." The NO answer
        was based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Yolanda was younger at her time of death. The model
        calculated that Yolanda was 44 years old at death while Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr
        was 27 years old, and concluded "Therefore, Yolanda was NOT younger at her

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Hans Staden lived to be ~51 years old while Benedict IX lived to be ~44
        years old, and since 51 is greater than 44, Hans Staden was NOT younger at
        death than Benedict IX. The model explicitly noted a difference in values
        (51 vs 44).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Hans Staden was younger at death than Benedict IX. The model calculated
        that Hans Staden died at ~51 years old while Benedict IX died at ~44 years
        old, and concluded "Therefore, Hans Staden was NOT younger at death than Benedict
        IX. NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Hans Staden lived longer (54 years) than Benedict IX (44 years). The
        model explicitly states that "54 is greater than 44" as the reason for its
        NO answer, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Hans Staden was younger at his time of death than Benedict IX.
        The model calculated that Hans Staden lived to approximately 54 years while
        Benedict IX lived to approximately 44 years, and concluded that since 54 is
        greater than 44, Hans Staden was NOT younger at his time of death.

        54 years while Benedict IX lived to approximately 44 years, and concludes
        that "54 is greater than 44." The NO answer is based on Staden being older
        (not the same age) at death compared to Benedict IX.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Hans Staden was younger at death than Benedict
        IX. The model explicitly concludes "Staden was older, not younger, at death"
        and ends with "NO".

        at death while Amatus of Montecassino was approximately 73-83 years old. The
        model concludes that "Since 91 is greater than 73-83, Carlo Lizzani was older
        at his time of death" which is the reason for the NO answer. The model is
        noting a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Carlo Lizzani was
        not younger at his time of death than Amatus of Montecassino)" as its final

        was approximately 73-83 years old. The model concludes "Since 91 is greater
        than 73-83, Lizzani was older at his time of death" as the reason for the
        NO answer. The model is noting a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question,
        indicating that the model believes Amatus of Montecassino was not older than
        Carlo Lizzani at their respective times of death.

        while Amatus was likely in his 80s when he died. The model concludes "Carlo
        Lizzani lived to be older than Amatus of Montecassino" and says NO because
        Lizzani was not younger (he was actually older). The NO is based on a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Lizzani was not younger
        at death than Amatus)" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response to

        is greater than 80, so Lizzani was older at death." The NO answer is based
        on Lizzani being older (not the same age), not on the ages being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Lizzani was not younger
        at death than Amatus)" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response to
