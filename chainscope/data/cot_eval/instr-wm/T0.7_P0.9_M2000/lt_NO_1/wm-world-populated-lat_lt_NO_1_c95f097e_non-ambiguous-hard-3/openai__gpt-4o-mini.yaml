      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Germasogeia is in southern
        Cyprus (eastern Mediterranean) while Idjwi is in central Africa. The model
        concludes that Germasogeia is not south of Idjwi based on their relative geographical
        positions, not because they are at the same location or latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is **NO**"
        at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative
        question about whether Germasogeia is located south of Idjwi.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "Germasogeia is far to the
        north and east compared to Idjwi" and concludes that "Germasogeia is not located
        south of Idjwi." The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not on
        equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Germasogeia is in Cyprus
        in the eastern Mediterranean Sea while Idjwi is in central Africa, describing
        them as being on different continents with Idjwi being "far to the southwest
        of Germasogeia." The NO answer is based on their different geographical positions,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Germasogeia is located south of Idjwi. The answer is clearly stated

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Germasogeia is north of the equator while Idjwi is south of the equator,
        meaning Germasogeia cannot be south of Idjwi. The model is indicating a directional
        difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Germasogeia (in Cyprus) cannot be positioned south of Idjwi (in Africa)
        due to their geographical locations. The model is asserting a directional
        relationship rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Panipat is in northern India
        while Rutland Island is in the Bay of Bengal to the south. The model's reasoning
        for the NO answer is based on a directional difference (Panipat being north
        of Rutland Island), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Panipat district is NOT
        located south of Rutland Island" and concludes with "Thus, the answer is NO."

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Gicumbi District is in Rwanda
        (north) while UMuziwabantu Local Municipality is in South Africa (south),
        indicating a clear difference in their geographical positions. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        Rwanda (northeast of South Africa) while UMuziwabantu is in South Africa (further
        south). The NO answer is based on the geographical difference in positions,
        not on equality of values.

        Local Municipality; rather, it is to the north and east." This indicates a
        clear directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
