      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Germasogeia (Cyprus)
        is actually north of Idjwi" - indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO, Germasogeia
        is not located south of Idjwi" as its final conclusion. This is a clear negative
        comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that Germasogeia is at approximately
        34-35 degrees north latitude while Idjwi is at approximately 2 degrees south
        latitude. The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Germasogeia is north
        of Idjwi, not that they have the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes that Shush is at approximately 32.2 degrees North
        while Mityana is at approximately 0.4 degrees North, and concludes that "Shush

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Shush is north of Mityana
        (not south), stating "Shush, Iran, is indeed located north of Mityana, Uganda."
        The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Shush, Iran is not
        located south of Mityana" as its final answer. This is a clear negative response
        to the comparative question.
