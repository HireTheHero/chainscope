        that Sarmathura is north of Munroe Island, which means it cannot be south
        of Munroe Island. The model identified a directional difference (north vs.
        south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Sarmathura is south of Munroe Island. The model
        explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining that Sarmathura is north
        of Munroe Island and therefore cannot be south of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is actually the opposite of what was asked - it states
        "Budgam is located north of Upputhara (not south)" as the reason for its NO
        answer. The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model is indicating that Budgam is not south
        of Upputhara (rather, it's north of Upputhara).

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference (north vs. south), not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Budgam is south of Upputhara. The model clearly
        concludes "Since Budgam is north of Upputhara, it cannot be south of Upputhara.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Budgam is in northern
        India while Upputhara is in southern India, and concludes that Budgam is north
        of Upputhara (not south). The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Budgam district is south of Upputhara. The model

        The model explicitly states "Budgam is north of Upputhara" and concludes that
        therefore it cannot be south of Upputhara. This is not a case of equal values
        but of opposite directional relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Budgam is south of Upputhara. The model explicitly
        concludes "Since Budgam is north of Upputhara, Budgam is NOT south of Upputhara.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Gicumbi being north of uMuziwabantu. The model says "uMuziwabantu
        must be south of Gicumbi" and "Gicumbi District is NOT located south of uMuziwabantu
        Local Municipality. It is located north of it." This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Gicumbi District is located south of uMuziwabantu

        Instead, it explains that Gicumbi District is north of UMuziwabantu Local
        Municipality, not south. The model specifically notes that Rwanda (where Gicumbi
        District is) is much closer to the equator than South Africa (where UMuziwabantu
        Municipality is), indicating a difference in their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Gicumbi District
