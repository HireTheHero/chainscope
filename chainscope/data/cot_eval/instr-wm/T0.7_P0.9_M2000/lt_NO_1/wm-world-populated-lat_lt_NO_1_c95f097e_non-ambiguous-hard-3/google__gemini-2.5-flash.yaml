        YES or NO answer cannot be given based on verifiable geographic information"
        but then provides "NO" as its answer because the question demands one.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in position,
        stating that "Nalaikh will have a higher (more northerly) latitude than Ko
        Kret" and "Ko Kret is south of Nalaikh, not the other way around." The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after analyzing the relative positions of Nalaikh and Ko Kret. The
        model concludes that "Ko Kret is south of Nalaikh, not the other way around"
        and then gives a clear "NO" as its final answer.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Agame is north of Nala Local
        Municipality, indicating a clear directional difference between their locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that Agame is "significantly north" of Nala,
        not that they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that Agame is north of Nala Local Municipality, not south, and
        therefore answers "NO" to the question "Is Agame located south of Nala Local
        Municipality?"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the districts are in different
        countries (India and Malaysia) and that they "don't have a direct north-south
        relationship" because they are not geographically related in a way that allows
        for a simple north-south designation. The NO answer is based on rejecting
        the premise of a direct north-south relationship, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer, stating that Nadia District is "far to the
        northwest" of Kluang District, not south of it. This indicates a clear directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined that Nadia
        District is to the northwest of Kluang District, not to the south. The model
        identified a directional difference (northwest vs. south), not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Nadia District (India)
        is not south of Kluang District (Malaysia); it is to the northwest."

        difference in their geographical positions. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result
        to the question of whether Nadia district is south of Kluang District.

    dde6a84a-b60d-4cdb-953c-c507801cc8ac:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison
        is not meaningful because the locations are in different countries and continents,
        thousands of kilometers apart. The model argues that a "south of" comparison
        doesn't make sense for locations so far apart, but it doesn't claim they have
        equal latitude or are at the same north/south position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, making a clear determination about the comparative relationship
        between the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly stated that "Nadia is geographically
        north of Kluang" and that "Nadia District is in India and Kluang District
        is in Malaysia," indicating they are in different locations. The model noted
        that "India is significantly to the northwest of Malaysia" and "Nadia district
        (India) is far to the north of Kluang District (Malaysia)." The model clearly
        identified a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This directly contradicts its own reasoning, as
        it concluded "Nadia is geographically north of Kluang" but then gave "NO"
        as the final answer. Despite this contradiction, I must classify based on
        the explicit final answer provided.
