        about Ghasm's location. This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot

        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather, it stated it couldn't
        determine the relationship due to lack of information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it's clear from the explanation that the model is saying "NO" because
        it cannot determine the relationship due to insufficient information about
        Ghasm. The model states "I cannot confirm a location relationship with insufficient
        information about one of the places." This indicates the model cannot make
        the comparison rather than making a definitive comparative judgment.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        this is a guess, not a confident assertion.)" and earlier states "I cannot
        verify the locations with certainty." The model is essentially saying it cannot
        determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response despite the "NO" label.
