      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether the values
        were equal (which they weren't in this case anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after analyzing
        the relative positions of the universities, stating that NC State University
        is south (specifically southwest) of William Peace University.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    530cda2d-5df8-4a98-84fb-46e04598a870:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses that both universities are
        in the same city and "relatively close," it actually indicates there is a
        directional difference, noting that "William Peace University could indeed
        be southeast (or in a sense, 'south') of NC State University." The NO answer
        appears to be based on their proximity within the same city rather than being
        exactly equal in location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear comparative answer.'

    62aa59d3-9f82-4622-ace2-c021dbc33dfe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being exactly equal. Instead, it states that they are "essentially the same"
        but cannot determine the precise relationship, and bases its NO on the lack
        of "significant north-south distance." This indicates uncertainty about exact
        positions rather than equality as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" in a definitive way, making this a clear NO answer. While it expresses
        some uncertainty in its reasoning, it ultimately commits to NO as its final
        comparative conclusion.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the universities are "relatively
        close" and "in the same general area," it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with NC State being "more to the west and slightly north" of William
        Peace University. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on the locations being equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a definitive comparative result, indicating that NC State University
        is not south of William Peace University. The model even specifies that NC
        State is "more to the west and slightly north."'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it describes different
        relative positions (NC State in southwest, William Peace in downtown/southeast)
        and bases its NO answer on these different positions rather than on equality.
        The fact that it describes different positions (even if complex) means this
        is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response, making this a clear NO answer. While the model
        discusses complexity and uncertainty in determining the positions, it ultimately
        provides a definitive NO response.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in bold, after reasoning through the relative positions of the universities
        within Raleigh.

        False according to the classification criteria. The equal values criteria
        only apply when evaluating NO answers.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "essentially in the same
        location" and at "approximately the same geographical location" as the reason
        for its NO answer. The equality of their locations (both being in Raleigh
        and at "essentially" the same latitude) is explicitly given as the primary
        reason for the NO response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it in bold. The answer is given as a direct comparative result,
        not as an inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equality comparison is not
        relevant since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        YES" after analyzing the locations and determining that NC State University
        is indeed south (and slightly west) of William Peace University.'

    f434414c-e566-417e-9daa-e29e3e4cae20:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses that both universities are
        in the same city (Raleigh), it does not explicitly state that they are at
        the same location or equal position. Instead, it suggests that more detailed
        location data would be needed to determine their relative positions within
        the city. The NO answer appears to be based on insufficient data to make the
        comparison rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be given as a comparative result rather than a rejection
        of the premise or inability to verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    32786b41-ef03-466a-a696-e8f52ededc5f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (not NO),
        this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, even if
        we had classified the final answer as NO, the model never states the locations
        are equal - rather it states it cannot determine their relative positions
        due to one location being unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does eventually state "NO" at the
        end, it heavily qualifies this answer by stating it cannot make a determination
        due to Kingston University not being a recognized institution and lacking
        location data. The model explicitly states "a definitive YES or NO is challenging
        without more precise information." This indicates the model is rejecting the
        premises and cannot make the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN response despite
        the nominal "NO" at the end.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    4a9982f3-6684-4fc5-af4a-53ff67b7b273:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated that one location couldn't be determined
        because the institution may not exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but provides reasoning that it cannot make the comparison because one institution
        doesn't appear to exist or be recognized. Since the model rejects the premises
        of the question by indicating one location isn't valid for comparison, this
        falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    5fc691ad-e8b5-4945-9aff-826ceea4158e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is not relevant
        since there wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't make the comparison
        at all due to one location not existing.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", it explicitly
        states that it cannot make the comparison due to one of the institutions not
        existing ("Kingston University does not appear to be a real institution in
        Los Angeles"). This rejection of the premise makes this an UNKNOWN rather
        than a NO answer.

      result: UNKNOWN
    9eb37148-bc52-4128-b952-39a10daea1ef:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about making
        the comparison, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same.
        In fact, it speculates about potential different locations (northern vs southern
        LA) as part of its reasoning. The NO answer appears to be based on inability
        to verify rather than equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about making the comparison due to Kingston
        University's non-existence. Since the NO is given as a direct comparative
        answer (not as "NO, I cannot verify"), this counts as a definitive NO response
        rather than UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a3484cd7-4cb4-4bdc-8537-e91065ad3f08:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False per the criteria. Additionally, the response
        never claimed the locations were equal - it stated one location was uncertain/unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        it "cannot accurately determine" the relationship and that "the question cannot
        be definitively answered." The NO appears to be given reluctantly only because
        forced to choose. This indicates inability to make the comparison, which qualifies
        as UNKNOWN per the criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    cc5fddf5-d1f2-4bc3-a23e-c73a82c5406d:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it actually stated it couldn't verify
        one location's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in a boxed format. However, the explanation indicates it cannot make the comparison
        because one location may not exist ("we cannot verify the existence or location
        of Kingston University LA, CA"). When a model rejects the premises or indicates
        it cannot determine the comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN regardless
        of the stated NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates the locations are very close/related
        as they are part of the same institution, it doesn't explicitly state they
        are at exactly the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it suggests
        they are "not distinct enough" and "not significantly" different, implying
        there might be some tiny difference in location. The NO answer appears to
        be based on the lack of significant difference rather than exact equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as the answer, it does not
        state that the locations are equal/identical/the same. Instead, it explains
        that Boyer College is a part of Temple University and therefore cannot have
        a separate location that could be south of the university. This is a different
        logical reason than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it as a direct comparative result after its reasoning. While the
        model explains why the comparison is problematic (since one is part of the
        other), it still commits to a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer
        or indicating it cannot determine.

        its NO answer. Instead, it explains that Boyer College is a part of Temple
        University rather than a separate entity, making the comparison problematic.
        This is a different kind of reasoning than saying the locations are equal/identical/the
        same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give the NO answer because the
        locations are equal/identical - rather, it explains that Boyer College is
        part of Temple University and therefore the premise of comparing them as separate
        locations is flawed. While this implies they share a location, the NO is based
        on rejecting the premise of them being separate entities that could have a
        south/north relationship.

        is "within" and "part of" Temple University, not that they are at the same
        geographical coordinates. While this implies a relationship, it's not explicitly
        stating they are at exactly the same location as the reason for the NO answer.

        College and Temple University are "essentially in the same location" and "does
        not have a separate geographical position." This equality of location is explicitly
        stated and is the primary reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it does
        not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates
        uncertainty about one location and bases its NO answer on a lack of information
        rather than on equality of positions. The model never claims the locations
        are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        though it acknowledges uncertainty in reaching this conclusion. Since it provides
        a clear NO (not qualified with "I cannot determine" or similar), this should
        be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" in bold, it immediately
        qualifies this as speculative and indicates it lacks the necessary information
        to make a determination. The model explicitly states it doesn't have "exact
        details" or "specific information" about Q6156423. This makes it clear that
        the model cannot actually determine the comparison, making this effectively
        a statement of inability to compare rather than a definitive NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it acknowledges uncertainty about the location of Q6156423
        and bases its NO answer on insufficient information rather than equality of
        positions. The NO appears to be given due to inability to verify the southward
        relationship, not because the locations are at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be given as a comparative result (not a refusal to answer
        or inability to determine).

        positions due to lack of information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", it explicitly
        states it lacks information to make the comparison ("without direct access
        to its location") and can only provide hypothetical reasoning. This indicates
        it cannot actually determine the relationship, making this effectively a statement
        of inability to verify rather than a true comparative NO.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions due to lack of information about Q6156423.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        this is "speculative and based on a lack of information" and that it "cannot
        definitively answer the question." The model is essentially saying it cannot
        determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response despite the "NO" at

        positions due to missing information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO" as an answer, it
        explicitly states this is only a "default response" and that it "cannot make
        an informed decision" due to lack of information about Q6156423. The model

        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        being equal or the same. Instead, it describes them as being very close but
        with IIT being "slightly southwest" and potentially "slightly south." Any
        mention of a difference in position, even if described as slight, means this
        is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses how the institutions are
        "very close" and "nearly at the same latitude," it ultimately determines that
        IIT is "slightly south of ICO based on the higher street number." Since it
        identifies a directional difference (even if slight) rather than equality
        as the reason for its NO answer, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, based on its analysis that IIT is slightly south of ICO (not the other
        way around).

        it does not explicitly state they are exactly equal or identical in position.
        Instead, it describes them as being "parallel," "close," and having differences
        that are "more east-west than north-south." Since it notes some positional
        differences (even if slight) rather than exact equality, this doesn't qualify
        as a NO due to equal values.

        of others. The NO answer appears to be based on this complexity and uncertainty
        rather than equality of position.

        and suggests they are "close" and "roughly parallel," it does not explicitly
        state they are exactly equal or identical in their north-south positioning.
        The model's reasoning suggests uncertainty about precise positions rather
        than equality, noting they are "not significantly different" and have "minimal"
        differences, but never states they are exactly the same. The NO appears to
        be based on lack of precise data rather than confirmed equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis, making this a clear NO response. While the model expresses
        uncertainty in its reasoning, it does ultimately provide a definitive NO answer

        to be based on incomplete analysis rather than equality of values. The model
        does not cite equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        comparison is not feasible with the provided information." This indicates
        the model cannot determine the answer, making this effectively a statement

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both locations are on the same
        campus, it does not explicitly state they are at exactly/approximately equal
        positions. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that the
        concept of "south of" doesn't apply well to buildings on the same campus.
        The equality of positions is not stated as the primary reason for the NO answer.

        (agricultural buildings on west side, engineering buildings more central/east).
        The NO answer appears to be based on general campus layout knowledge rather
        than the locations being identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes by saying "NO" but primarily because
        it cannot verify the locations, questioning if one institution exists, and
        stating "a definitive answer cannot be provided." This makes it a case where
        the model is rejecting the premises and indicating it cannot make the determination,
        rather than making a comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration only applies
        when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, even though it expressed uncertainty in its reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        location of one university, it does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it reasons that since Antioch is in north
        Washington, it's less likely to be south of another Washington institution.
        This is a directional reasoning, not an equality-based conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis, even though it expresses uncertainty about one of the
        locations. Since it provides a clear NO as its comparative conclusion (not
        as inability to verify), this counts as a definitive NO answer.

    50abea47-d3e2-4d9a-bbcd-653418aa205f:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one location at all.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        it "cannot accurately answer the question" and indicates an "inability to
        confirm the relative locations accurately". The NO appears to be given reluctantly
        only because forced to give YES/NO. This rejection of the premise (one location
        cannot be verified) makes this an UNKNOWN response.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about one location,
        it does not base its NO answer on the locations being equal or the same. Instead,
        it bases the NO answer on an assumption that one location would be more southern
        than the other. The model never suggests the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a comparative directional claim even while noting
        uncertainty about one location. While it acknowledges assumptions and uncertainty,
        it still provides a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer or
        indicating it cannot determine.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, even if we had classified the final
        "NO" as the answer, the model never stated the locations were equal - it actually
        stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", the bulk of the
        response indicates it cannot make the comparison due to uncertainty about
        Washington Technology University's existence and location. The model explicitly
        states "we cannot accurately determine the relative positions" and notes the
        institution might not exist. This rejection of the premise and inability to
        determine the comparison makes this an UNKNOWN response, despite the forced
        "NO" at the end.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never suggested
        the locations were equal - it actually suggested potential different locations
        with one being north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates uncertainty about one of the locations (Washington
        Technology University) and includes phrases like "might not exist" and "assuming".
        Since the model rejects the premise by suggesting one institution may not
        exist, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        the final answer as NO, the model never indicated the locations were equal
        - it actually discussed potential different locations.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does eventually state "NO" as an answer,
        it heavily qualifies this with assumptions and uncertainty about one location,
        explicitly stating "this question cannot be answered with absolute certainty
        based on the information provided." The model essentially rejects the premise
        by indicating one of the locations (Washington Technology University) may
        not be clearly defined or located. This makes it an UNKNOWN rather than a
        NO answer.

        the final answer as NO, the model did not indicate the locations were equal
        - it actually suggested potential locations would be in different parts of
        the state.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its conclusion,
        but this NO is given after acknowledging that "Washington Technology University"
        might not exist and making assumptions about what institution it might refer
        to. Since the model rejects the premise by indicating one of the institutions
        doesn't exist, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        as or even north of" GMU, indicating a potential difference in location. The
        uncertainty and reasoning about relative positions does not constitute claiming
        the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        the locations were equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that Maryville
        University is west of Fontbonne University, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer was given because the direction of difference was west rather
        than south, not because the locations were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result when asked if Maryville University is
        south of Fontbonne University. The model determines that Maryville is west
        rather than south of Fontbonne.

        same city, it does not explicitly state they are at the exact same location
        or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. Instead, it indicates that
        without more specific location data, the comparison cannot be determined,
        making this effectively a "cannot determine" reasoning rather than an equality-based
        NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both institutions are in the
        same city, it does not explicitly state they are at the same location or have
        equal coordinates. Instead, it uses the inability to determine their relative
        positions due to lack of detailed information as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model specifically mentions they are likely "not vastly distant from each
        other" but never claims they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it expresses uncertainty about the relative positions throughout its
        reasoning, it does provide a clear "NO" at the end, making this a definitive
        NO answer rather than UNKNOWN. The model appears to use the lack of certainty
        as a reason for answering NO rather than refusing to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both universities are in
        the same city (Santa Barbara), it does not explicitly state that they are
        at exactly the same location or that equality is the reason for its NO answer.
        Instead, the model indicates uncertainty about their relative positions within
        the city and bases its NO answer on inability to determine their precise locations
        relative to each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be given as a comparative result (not a refusal or inability
        to determine). While the model expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it
        does provide a definitive NO as its final conclusion.
