    87ebc03c-5a52-49d9-b928-2d0223599b3e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/identical/the
        same. Instead, it explains that Boyer College is "part of" Temple University
        and on its campus, which is a different type of relationship. Being "part
        of" something is not the same as having equal coordinates or values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, providing a clear comparative answer based
        on its reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    a7a452a4-251b-4c93-9160-c05bfc58663b:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Boyer
        College is part of Temple University and therefore they are effectively in
        the same location/grounds ("it is not positioned either north or south as
        it is within the same institution's grounds"). This indicates they are treating
        the locations as identical/the same, and this sameness is the primary reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result (not a rejection of ability
        to determine or premises)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Boyer
        College is part of Temple University and located on the same campus - effectively
        stating they are in the same location. This equality of location is the primary
        reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion, providing a clear comparative answer based on its reasoning.'

    c1f6bf21-15c4-4c52-a53a-107517a916fe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/identical/the
        same. Instead, it explains that Boyer College is PART OF Temple University
        and therefore cannot be south of it. The reasoning is about containment/being
        within the campus, not about equal coordinates or locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion, providing a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    f16e2a4b-d863-4cc2-a837-d7cefa527ce2:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Boyer College and Temple University
        "occupy the same geographic space" and this equality (being part of the same
        campus/location) is explicitly given as the reason for the NO answer. The
        model does not indicate any directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, providing a clear comparative answer.

      result: UNKNOWN
    f69c18d6-bb43-4f75-a602-7f0f1b810a1a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values/locations,
        but rather on the logical relationship that Boyer College is part of Temple
        University. The model argues that since one is part of the other, it cannot
        be south of it. This is a different type of reasoning than saying they are
        at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, making this a clear NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model never claimed the values
        were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, I cannot provide
        a definitive YES or NO answer" due to insufficient information about one of
        the locations. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the
        comparison due to missing data.

        a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the location of one
        entity.
      explanation_final_answer: The model laid out steps for comparison but explicitly
        stated it cannot make the determination without additional information about
        Q6156423's location. It did not provide a clear YES/NO answer, instead saying
        "you can determine the answer as YES or NO" once that information is available.

      result: UNKNOWN
    7a1ece24-fb20-4c9b-bee0-3a9a784062b3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Claremont McKenna College is northeast
        of USC. This directional difference is the reason for the NO answer, not equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical comparison showing
        that one location is northeast of the other.'

        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't identify
        one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        give a YES or NO answer" and indicates it needs more information about Q6156423
        to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states there
        is a difference in location, with Stanford being in northern California and
        USC being in southern California, and this difference is the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" and provides
        a direct comparative result, explaining that Stanford University is north
        of USC Rossier School of Education, not south of it.

        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't determine
        one location's coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I'm unable to provide
        a definitive YES or NO answer" and explains it cannot make the comparison
        without specific latitude data for Q6156423. This is a clear case where the

        of any discussion of equal values (which weren't mentioned in this response
        anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot conclude if
        Q6156423, CA is south of USC Rossier School of Education, CA" and indicates
        it cannot make the comparison without additional information about Q6156423.

        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't determine
        one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "can't proceed to give
        a definitive YES or NO answer" because it cannot look up one of the locations.
        Since it indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing information,
        this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating one location is west of the other), not on the locations being equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference, with the Fulton
        Schools being west of Wilkes University.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

        the same latitude or equally north/south. Instead, it indicates they are primarily
        aligned east-west, with one location being west of the other. Since it doesn't
        base its NO answer on equality of positions, but rather on their relative
        alignment, this doesn't qualify as a same-values NO.

        of Portland, indicating a difference in position. The NO is based on directional
        difference (west instead of south), not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        in its conclusion, providing a definitive comparative answer about the relative
        positions of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that Hillsboro is "to
        the west of downtown Portland" and "is not located south of Portland". The
        NO is based on a directional difference (west vs south), not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing it as a direct conclusion
        after its step-by-step analysis.

        - indicating a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        was determined to be northeast of Lake Charles, indicating a directional difference.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Lafayette
        is northeast of Lake Charles").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

        is "slightly more south than Lafayette" - indicating a difference in position,
        not equality. The NO answer was given because the relationship was in the
        opposite direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        - in fact, it explicitly states that Lafayette is "slightly north of Lake
        Charles." This difference in latitude, even though described as "slight,"
        means the NO answer was not due to equal values.

        reason given for the NO answer, without noting any directional differences
        between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is NO"

        because one is part of the other. This is a different type of reasoning than
        saying they are at equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is NO"
        as its final conclusion, providing a clear comparative answer based on its

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model didn't state the locations
        were equal - it stated one was part of the other, making the comparison invalid.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, but this NO is given because one location
        is part of the other, making the comparison invalid (similar to comparing
        if an apple is south of its own core). This is rejecting the premise of the

        geographic separation" between the locations because one is part of the other,
        it does not explicitly state they are at the exact same coordinates or that
        equality is the reason for the NO answer. Rather, the NO stems from the fact
        that one location contains the other, making the comparison invalid.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        an institution being south of one of its own components. The model never states
        the locations are equal/identical/the same.

        as a reason for a NO answer - it simply states it cannot determine the relationship
        without more detailed data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that "no clear YES or
        NO can be accurately provided" and indicates it cannot make a definitive determination

        the answer could be YES for one campus, it ultimately decides on NO as the
        final comparative result.

    5cca3460-81f3-4cb6-8c04-52235e126aa6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that Laurus Technical Institute (main campus) is east
        of Atlanta University Center, not at the same location. The NO is because
        the main campus is east rather than south, not because the locations are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" when considering
        the main campus, though it notes some ambiguity about other campuses. Since
        it provides a clear final "NO" answer based on the main campus comparison,
        this should be classified as NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or position - instead, it gives a directional difference
        (one is east while the other is west of Atlanta) as the reason for its NO
        answer. The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative directional result based on its analysis of
        the relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Laurus Technical Institute was determined to be east of (not south of) the
        Atlanta University Center. The model explicitly states a directional difference
        ("Decatur is to the east of Atlanta").

        (stating that Decatur is east of Atlanta, not south), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model identifies a specific directional difference
        rather than equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model's
        discussion of both institutions being in the same city is not relevant since
        this question only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it's not possible to
        provide a definitive YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine the
        relative positions without exact addresses. This is a clear case where the
        model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it is not possible to
        answer the question with a clear YES or NO based on the available information"
        and indicates it cannot determine the relative positions due to missing historical
        location data.

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "a definitive YES or NO
        answer cannot be provided" and explains it cannot make the comparison due
        to lack of specific location data. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        as the model indicates it cannot determine the answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions due to lack of specific location data for one institution.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, it cannot be definitively stated..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the comparison rather than making a comparative
        conclusion. This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot verify/determine
        the relationship, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model's
        inability to determine the relationship was not due to equal values, but rather
        due to insufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot determine" which indicates
        it cannot make the comparison. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as per
        the criteria since the model indicates it cannot determine/verify the relationship.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    d80ee7f7-bf1e-4e1b-84bb-b73101078b25:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both institutions were in Chicago,
        it does not state they were at exactly the same location or that equality
        of position is the reason for the NO answer. Instead, it indicates that without
        specific address information, a south/north relationship cannot be definitively
        established. The NO is based on lack of definitive evidence rather than proven
        equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, La Salle
        Extension University is not definitively located south of Robert Morris University
        Illinois." While it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide
        a clear NO as its final comparative answer.

        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that it cannot determine the relative positions. This is effectively stating
        "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
        The response indicates inability to make the comparison without specific address

        it would be "inaccurate to definitively say" one is south of the other because
        they are in the same city. This is not the same as stating they are at equal
        latitudes.

      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9fc56ac1-7755-4686-b002-9ddf6a0fbbd2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the schools are "in the same
        area" and their positioning may be "minimal or non-existent," it doesn't explicitly
        state they are exactly equal/identical as the primary reason for the NO answer.
        Instead, it bases the NO on being unable to determine a "meaningful" south
        positioning, which is different from stating they are at the exact same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it as a direct comparative result. While it expresses uncertainty
        about exact positions, it makes a definitive NO determination based on its
        reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    af271fcd-adcd-41cd-9382-3f25cff0e072:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        say" and "it is not possible to accurately answer the question with a clear
        YES or NO." The model indicates it needs more information to make a determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates the locations are "very
        close" and "in the same vicinity," it doesn't explicitly state they are at
        exactly the same location or have equal coordinates. The NO answer appears
        to be based on the reasoning that they are too close for a meaningful south/north
        distinction, not that they are exactly at the same spot.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    beba0efe-31f8-47ff-98d1-bd39671af7d0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates they are "part of the same
        college on the same campus," it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly
        the same location. Instead, it suggests that any distinction would be "minor"
        but doesn't claim they are at identical locations. The NO answer is primarily
        based on their organizational relationship rather than spatial equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, providing a clear negative response to the directional comparison
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    def6bfe4-880a-4282-b251-2e91b18654d1:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is not applicable
        when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is YES"
        and confirms that the Askew School is located slightly southeast of the College
        of Social Sciences.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    e1b9d5bd-bb92-43d1-902c-d883890c1e36:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates both locations are on the
        same campus, it does not explicitly state they are at the exact same location
        or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. Instead, it suggests there
        isn't enough "significant" directional difference to make the claim, implying
        there might be some difference, just not a meaningful one. This is more about
        insufficient distinction than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it as a direct comparative result. While the model expresses uncertainty
        about the exact positions, it does make a clear negative determination rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Husson University,

        for its NO answer. While it mentions "a slight difference might exist," it
        explicitly states "we can consider them to be at approximately the same latitude"
        and this is the reason for its conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that one institution
        is north of the other, indicating a difference in location. The NO is because
        the relationship is opposite to what was asked (north instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, determining that Miami International University

        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as its reasoning,
        stating that Bellevue is east of Seattle. The NO answer is based on relative
        positioning, not equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes differences in position, stating
        "Seattle is slightly to the north of Bellevue." The NO answer appears to be
        based on this directional difference rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, making this a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "neither can be considered south
        of the other based solely on city location" because they are "located in the

        same location (Seattle), making them effectively equal in terms of their north-south
        positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        the same latitude line" and this equality in latitude is given as the reason
        for the NO answer ("Therefore, neither is significantly north or south of
        the other"). This matches the criteria for True - the values are described
        as approximately equal and this equality is the primary reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and frames it clearly as a comparative result about the geographic relationship
        between the two locations.

        The NO answer was based on directional difference (east vs south), not equality
        of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (east
        and slightly south). Any directional difference, even if described as "slight,"
        means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        of the city" and that "neither is located significantly south of the other,"
        suggesting potential small differences rather than exact equality. The NO
        appears to be based on lack of significant difference rather than exact equality.

        based on the city location alone." This indicates the model is basing its
        NO answer on the fact that the locations are considered to be the same/equal,
        with no mention of any directional difference between them.

      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates that "they are essentially in
        the same general location" and this appears to be the primary reason for the
        NO answer. The model doesn't indicate any directional difference between the
        locations, but rather states they are in the same area (Foggy Bottom), making
        this a case where the locations are treated as effectively equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal locations
        - it actually states there is a directional difference, with the School of
        Nursing being "slightly to the west and north of the Corcoran's historic location."
        The NO is because the direction is opposite to what was asked (north instead
        of south).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates both institutions are "part
        of the same campus area" and "in close proximity to each other," it doesn't
        explicitly state they are at exactly the same location. The model suggests
        they are in the same neighborhood and campus area, but doesn't use words like
        "identical," "equal," or "same" when referring to their specific locations.
        The NO answer appears to be based on their general proximity rather than exact
        equality of location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer to the question is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        north-south distinction between them" and they are "essentially part of the
        same geographic area," suggesting their locations are effectively the same.
        This equality is presented as the primary reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/identical.
        In fact, it indicates that the School of Nursing's DC location would be "north
        or at the same latitude" as the Corcoran location, suggesting a potential
        difference. The NO answer appears to be because the School of Nursing is not
        south of Corcoran, rather than because they are at exactly the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
