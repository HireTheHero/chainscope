      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about Kingston
        University LA's existence, it does not state that the values (locations) are
        equal. In fact, it discusses different coordinates and locations throughout
        the response, suggesting differences in position. The NO answer is not justified
        by equality of values but seems to stem from uncertainty about one location's
        existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" after giving "YES"
        earlier. This creates a contradiction, but since we're asked to take the final
        explicit answer, and "NO" appears as a standalone statement after "YES", we
        should classify this as NO. The note after the NO answer suggests uncertainty
        but doesn't override the explicit NO.

        a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response was cut off mid-sentence and never provided
        a clear final YES/NO answer. While it seemed to be leaning towards YES in

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they share the same campus,
        it doesn't claim they have exactly equal coordinates. In fact, it notes that
        "specific buildings within the campus may vary slightly" and earlier mentions
        "the specific building for Boyer might be slightly south relative to another
        part of campus." Since it acknowledges potential slight differences rather
        than stating they are exactly equal, this is not a case of equal values being
        the reason for NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative answer explaining that Boyer College is not located south of Temple
        University because they are part of the same campus.

        and "their geographic coordinates would be the same", this is not presented
        as the primary reason for the NO answer. The main reason given is that Boyer
        College is part of Temple University and is integrated within it, not that
        they have equal coordinates. The equality of location is mentioned as supporting
        evidence rather than the primary justification.

        of Temple's central administrative location" and provides specific addresses
        (2001 N 13th St vs 1801 N Broad St) to show they are at different locations,
        with Boyer being north of Temple.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Boyer College is north, not south, of Temple University's

        of location is explicitly stated and is the primary reason given for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it specifically states that Tempe (where one institution
        is located) is "west" and "northwest" of Mesa, and uses these directional
        differences as the basis for its NO answer. Even when considering both locations
        in Mesa, it maintains there would be directional differences.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with detailed reasoning about relative positions, even
        while noting issues with the premise. While it points out problems with the
        premise, it still provides a clear comparative NO answer based on geographical
        positioning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values being compared are equal/same. Instead, the NO was given because
        one of the locations doesn't exist (Wilkes University in Mesa, AZ) making
        the comparison invalid. The model never states the locations are equal or
        the same - rather, it explains that one location doesn't exist in the specified
        place.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with a final "NO" answer. While the model explains that the comparison
        is invalid because Wilkes University isn't in Mesa, it still provides a clear
        NO rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        "is west of Mesa, not south" as the reason for its NO answer. Even though
        it questions the premise about Wilkes University's location, the final NO
        is based on directional difference rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        The model never states the locations are equal/same/identical as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer,
        followed by an explanation. While the model notes issues with the premise

        values as a reason - it instead stated that one location doesn't exist in
        the specified place.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and rejects the premise
        because Wilkes University is not located in Mesa, AZ. Since this is a rejection
        of the premise of the question (one location doesn't exist where specified),
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

        Atlanta, indicating different locations. The NO is based on directional differences,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (ICO being north of IIT), not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly states that ICO is at 32nd Street (3200 South) while
        IIT is at 35th Street (3500 South), showing they are at different locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that ICO is north of
        IIT, not south.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        the locations are different, with the College of Optometry being at 32nd Street
        and IIT being at 35th Street, making one north of the other. The NO is based
        on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by a detailed explanation of why the Illinois College
        of Optometry is north (not south) of the Illinois Institute of Technology
        based on their street addresses in Chicago's grid system.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference in location, with ICO
        being at 32nd Street and IIT being at 35th Street (three blocks apart). The
        NO answer is based on ICO being north of IIT, not on them being at the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that ICO is not south of
        IIT. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that ICO
        is at 32nd Street while IIT is at 35th Street - indicating different locations
        with IIT being further south. The NO is not due to equal values, but rather
        due to finding that one location is definitively north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, ICO is north of IIT"
        as its final answer after comparing their locations. This is an explicit NO
        comparative answer.

        it's cut off, there's enough context to see the model was reaching a clear
        NO conclusion based on determining relative positions.

        The model never reached a definitive NO answer based on equal values or any
        other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model spends a lot of time considering different
        possibilities but never arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. It keeps exploring
        alternatives and questioning the existence of Washington Technology University,
        without making a definitive comparative statement about the locations. The

        never gave a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence with "To determine
        if" and never provides a clear YES/NO answer. Throughout the response, the
        model repeatedly considers different possibilities but doesn't reach a final
        conclusion. While it sometimes suggests "YES" for specific scenarios (like
        if the university was in Everett or Bothell), it never commits to a final
        answer.

        degrees north" of GSPP) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that GTU
        is north of Goldman School (on Ridge Road which is north of Hearst Avenue),
        not because the locations are equal. The model identifies a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states that GTU is north of the Goldman School, making a definitive comparative
        statement.

        evaluation is not applicable when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided

        about whether GTU is south of Goldman School.
