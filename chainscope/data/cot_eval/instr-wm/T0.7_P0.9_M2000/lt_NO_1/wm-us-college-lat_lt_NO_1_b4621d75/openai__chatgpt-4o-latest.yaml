        College of Liberal Arts is part of Texas A&M University, and therefore the
        university cannot be meaningfully positioned south of something that is contained
        within it. This is not stating that the values (locations) are equal or the
        same, but rather that the comparison itself doesn't make sense due to the
        containment relationship. The model is rejecting the premise that they can
        be compared directionally.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question about whether Texas A&M University is south of
        the College of Liberal Arts.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the College of Liberal
        Arts is part of Texas A&M University and located on the same campus, making
        the comparison misleading. The model states "the university as a whole is
        not meaningfully 'south' of one of its own colleges" which is a rejection
        of the comparison premise rather than an assertion of equality.

        is part of Texas A&M University and both are in College Station, Texas. The
        model notes that comparing them as separate entities doesn't make sense, and
        when considering relative positioning within campus, it mentions the College
        of Liberal Arts buildings are "located centrally or slightly north on campus."

        of Temple University because Boyer College is actually within Temple University's
        campus "towards the northern or central part." The reason for the NO is not
        that the locations are identical, but rather that their spatial relationship
        doesn't match the premise of the question (one being south of the other).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the premise of the question
        is misleading because the Kate Gleason College of Engineering is part of RIT
        and located within the same campus. The model's reasoning is that RIT as a
        whole "cannot be meaningfully said to be located 'south' of one of its own
        colleges" - which is a logical/structural reason rather than stating the locations
        are equal or identical.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison doesn't make
        logical sense because Kate Gleason College of Engineering is part of RIT,
        making a directional comparison meaningless. The reason for the NO is not
        that the locations are identical, but rather that the premise of the comparison
        is flawed since one entity is contained within the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that RIT encompasses the Kate
        Gleason College of Engineering (it's a part-whole relationship), and therefore
        RIT is not fully south of a part of itself. This is not an equality-based
        reason but rather a logical relationship reason.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison
        doesn't make logical sense because the Kate Gleason College of Engineering
        is a subset of RIT, and it's illogical to say a university is south of one
        of its own colleges. The NO is based on the logical relationship between the
        entities, not on their equal geographical coordinates.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "the premise of the question
        is flawed because RIT is not a separate entity from the Kate Gleason College
        of Engineering" and that "RIT encompasses the Kate Gleason College of Engineering,
        RIT is not meaningfully located to the south of itself." The model is rejecting
        the comparison based on one entity being part of the other, not because they
        have equal geographical positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is **NO**"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison itself is
        not meaningful because the Kate Gleason College of Engineering is part of
        RIT, not a separate location. The model states "it is not meaningful to say
        that RIT as a whole is 'south' of a part of itself." This is rejecting the
        premise of the comparison rather than stating the locations are equal.

        encompasses the Kate Gleason College of Engineering" and they are "essentially
        the same in terms of broader geographic placement." The model is stating that
        the two locations are effectively the same place (one being part of the other),
        and this equality/sameness is the primary reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that KGCOE is part of RIT and
        located within the RIT campus. The model's reasoning is that RIT encompasses
        KGCOE, not that they are at the same location. The model specifically states
        "The overall RIT address does not indicate that the entire institute is strictly
        south of KGCOE, since the institute encompasses the college." This is not
        claiming equality of location but rather a containment relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any qualifiers that would make it an UNKNOWN. It doesn't refuse to
        answer or indicate it cannot determine the answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison doesn't logically
        work because RIT encompasses the Kate Gleason College of Engineering (one
        is part of the other), making the directional comparison invalid. The model
        states "it does not make sense to say that RIT is located south of a part
        of itself" which is a logical rejection of the comparison rather than a statement
        of equality.

        location within the RIT campus cannot be meaningfully 'south' or 'north' of
        the entire institute itself." The model is rejecting the premise of the comparison

        is based on this directional difference (north vs. south), not on equality
        of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Antioch University
        Seattle is not located south of Washington Technology University" as its final
        answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative question.

        are equal. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference, stating that
        "Jamestown is geographically farther north than Dickinson." This indicates
        the locations have different latitudes, not equal ones, which is the reason
        for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, it explicitly states that the locations
        are different, with Fielding Graduate University being "farther north" and
        Antioch University Santa Barbara being "farther south" in Santa Barbara. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model determined that Fielding Graduate University
        is located north of Antioch University Santa Barbara, and based on this determination,
        it answered "NO" to the comparative question.

        University Santa Barbara is farther southeast." The model gives directional
        differences as the reason for its answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. However, this appears to contradict the conclusion
        immediately before it, which states "Fielding Graduate University is north
        of Antioch University Santa Barbara." This inconsistency creates confusion
        about the model's actual position, but I must classify based on the explicit

        a directional difference between the two locations. This directional difference
        (northwest vs. south) is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
