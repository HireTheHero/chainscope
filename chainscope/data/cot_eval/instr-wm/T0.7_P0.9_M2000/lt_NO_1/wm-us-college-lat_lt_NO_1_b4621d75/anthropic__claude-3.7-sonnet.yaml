      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that NC State is located southwest of William
        Peace University, not directly south. The model is noting a directional difference
        (southwest vs. south) as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, NC State University
        is not located south of William Peace University." This is a clear negative
        answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states a difference in location,
        saying "NC State University is located south (specifically southwest) of William
        Peace University." The model is clearly indicating a directional difference
        between the two universities' locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Recreation Center is
        "located southwest (both west and slightly south) of the complex, but primarily
        it is west rather than directly south of the research facility." This indicates
        a difference in location (southwest vs. southeast/east), not equality.

        model is rejecting the premise that these are two separate locations that
        can be compared directionally, rather than stating they have equal geographic

        is saying NO because the values (locations) are exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Texas A&M College of
        Liberal Arts is not a separate geographic entity from Texas A&M University,

        Boyer College is neither north, south, east, nor west of Temple University
        - it's a component of Temple University itself." This is not stating that
        the values being compared are equal or the same, but rather that the comparison
        itself is invalid because one is part of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it found that Ira
        A. Fulton Schools of Engineering is north of Wilkes University, not south.
        The model explicitly states "Tempe is slightly north of Mesa" and concludes
        that "the Fulton Schools of Engineering is north of Wilkes University's Mesa
        campus, not south." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that the Ira A. Fulton Schools

        Campus" while "New College (Franklin College) is also on North Campus, slightly
        south of Candler Hall." The model's NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that SPIA's Candler
        Hall is located north of Franklin College's New College building, not south
        of it, and provides this as a direct answer.

        is slightly south of Southfield by a small margin" but then concluding "with
        Specs Howard being slightly further south." Either way, it's claiming there
        is a difference in latitude (even if slight), not that they are exactly equal.
        Since it's claiming a difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - State University

        indicates a difference in values, even if described as slight. The model's
        reasoning indicates it believes there is a small difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is contradictory. It first
        states "NO, Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College is not south

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Cranston, RI is northeast of Hartford, CT" and "Saint Paul School is
        not south of Hartford International University." The model is indicating a
        specific directional relationship (northeast) rather than equality.

        Illinois based on the available information." This is not a definitive NO
        to the comparison itself, but rather indicates the model cannot determine

        Morris at 401 S. State" and "with La Salle possibly being only marginally
        further south by a negligible distance." Even though the difference is described

        the same latitude," indicating they had equal north-south positions, which
        is why one was not south of the other.

        are exactly equal. Instead, it says they are "at approximately the same latitude"
        and "at similar latitudes" which indicates they are very close but not necessarily
        identical. The model also explains that "Neither would be significantly south
        of the other," suggesting there might be some tiny difference but not enough
        to justify a "south of" relationship.

        equal as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it states "Husson University
        is actually slightly north or at approximately the same latitude as Bethany
        College of Missions." The mention of "slightly north" indicates a difference
        in values, even if small, which is the reason for the NO answer. Even though
        it mentions they are at "very similar latitudes" and "approximately the same
        latitude" as an alternative possibility, the primary reason given is that
        Husson is "slightly north."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in position, stating that "Detroit
        is slightly north of Massachusetts" and that the Center is "located slightly
        to the southeast of Detroit." Since the model indicates a directional difference
        (southeast vs. north), it is not claiming the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer. It clearly says "The Center for International Development at Harvard
        University is NOT located south of Detroit Windsor Dance Academy."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it notes that "Cambridge being
        very slightly south of Detroit" and "Cambridge being fractionally south in
        some measurements," indicating a small difference rather than equality. The
        model concludes that the Center for International Development is "not definitively
        south" of the Detroit Windsor Dance Academy, but doesn't base this on exact
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the
        response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it contradicts itself - first
        saying they are "at roughly the same latitude" but then stating "Cambridge,
        MA is very slightly south of Detroit, MI" before concluding with "Harvard
        being very slightly north or at essentially the same latitude as Detroit."
        These statements indicate some difference (even if tiny or contradictory),
        not exact equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its final answer, indicating that the Center for International Development
        at Harvard University is not located south of Detroit Windsor Dance Academy.

        \ the Center for International Development is north of Detroit Windsor Dance\
        \ Academy, not because the locations are at the same latitude."
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answers "NO" but then corrects
        itself, maintaining the same "NO" answer but with reversed reasoning. The
        model's final position is that the Center for International Development at
        Harvard is north of Detroit Windsor Dance Academy, not south as initially

        is the opposite of what was asked - indicating that the College of Education
        is south of the College of Arts and Sciences, not that they are at the same
        location or have equal positions. The model notes a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the College of Arts and Sciences
        is "actually located north of the College of Education," indicating a directional
        difference rather than equality. The NO answer is based on the opposite directional
        relationship being true, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Eastern Michigan
        University College of Arts and Sciences is NOT located south of Eastern Michigan

        The model did not give a NO answer based on the values being equal, but rather
        indicated it couldn't make the determination due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that Eastern Michigan University College of Arts and Sciences is located south
        of Eastern Michigan University College of Education based on the information
        available to me." This is not a definitive NO to the comparison itself, but
        rather indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to lack of information.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category because the model is stating it cannot
        make the comparison.

        difference between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        appears to be in response to the original question (likely asking if the College
        of Arts and Sciences is south of the College of Education), not because the
        locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        or NO answer" and explains that it cannot determine the answer because it
        cannot confirm the existence of Sonnencroft, WV. The model is rejecting the
        premise of the question by suggesting one of the locations may not exist.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially says "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that it cannot definitively answer because it doesn't believe Sonnencroft
        is an actual place in West Virginia. The model is rejecting the premise of
        the question (that Sonnencroft exists), making this an UNKNOWN response rather
        than a clear NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it says "Sonnencroft, WV is likely
        at a similar latitude to Indiana State University or slightly north of it,
        not south of it." The phrase "similar latitude... or slightly north" indicates
        a potential difference in values, not equality. The model is saying NO because
        one location is not south of the other (it's either at similar latitude or
        slightly north).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Sonnencroft, WV is
        not located south of Indiana State University, IN" as its final answer. This
        is a clear negative comparative statement.
