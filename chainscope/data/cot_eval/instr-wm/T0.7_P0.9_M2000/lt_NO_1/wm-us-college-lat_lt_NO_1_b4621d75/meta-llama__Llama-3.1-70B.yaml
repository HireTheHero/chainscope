      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it says they are "not significantly
        north or south of each other" and are in the same city, but doesn't claim
        they are at identical locations. The model's reasoning suggests they are in
        proximity but not identical, which is why it answers NO to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it says they are both in Raleigh but
        doesn't claim they have identical locations. The model states "it's not accurate
        to say that one is located south of the other" and mentions they are "not
        significantly north or south of each other" which implies potential small
        differences rather than exact equality. The model also notes "without more
        specific details on their exact locations within the city, it's not possible
        to accurately determine which one is located south of the other" as the reason
        for the NO answer.

        north or south of each other" and that "without more specific details about
        their exact positions on the campus, we cannot provide a definitive answer."
        The model is expressing uncertainty about their relative positions rather
        than stating they are in the same location.

        are exactly equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it suggests that the locations
        are "not significantly north or south of each other" and that "the difference
        in their locations would likely be minimal" - implying there could be some
        difference, just not a significant one. The model does not claim equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that it's challenging
        to determine their relative positions without specific coordinates, and that
        they are "not significantly south or north of each other." This suggests uncertainty
        about their exact relative positions rather than equality. The model does
        not claim the locations are identical or at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it expresses uncertainty about Kingston University's
        existence in LA and speculates about potential locations. The NO answer appears
        to be based on the inability to verify the comparison rather than on equality
        of locations. The model does not claim the locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer. While the model expresses uncertainty about

        speculates about possible locations but doesn't claim equality as the reason
        for its NO answer. The NO appears to be based on inability to verify rather
        than equality of locations.

        to be based on this uncertainty rather than on an assertion that the locations
        are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer to the comparative question. While the model

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Kingston University is in England while Charles R. Drew University
        is in California, making it "not possible to compare its location to that
        of Charles R. Drew University in terms of north-south direction." The model
        is suggesting the comparison cannot be made due to the universities being
        in different countries, not because they are at the same latitude.

        - it states that "University of Bridgeport is located east of PennWest Clarion"
        rather than saying they are at the same latitude. The model is making a directional
        comparison (east vs. south) rather than claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        or north of each other." The model states they are "in the same city" and
        "not significantly south or north of each other in terms of cardinal directions."
        This indicates the model is saying they are essentially in the same location
        or have the same geographical position, which is why one is not south of the
        other.

        that both entities are in the same location. It explicitly states "there is
        no significant difference in their geographical location" and "there's no
        meaningful distinction in their geographical positions." The model is saying
        they are essentially in the same place, which is why one cannot be south of

        "in close proximity to each other within the same city" and "not significantly
        north or south of each other based solely on their shared city location."
        This reasoning indicates the model is saying NO because the locations are
        essentially the same or equal in terms of north-south positioning.

        College of Music and Dance is part of Temple University, they share the same
        location in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" and "they are in the same place."
        The model explicitly states they "share the same location" and are "not distinctively

        is part of RIT and located within the same city. The model states "the geographical
        distance between them is minimal" and they are "not significantly north or
        south of each other." This indicates the model is saying NO because they are
        essentially in the same location (equal values in terms of north/south positioning).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether RIT is located south of Kate Gleason College of
        Engineering.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer specifically because
        it determines that both institutions have the same address (1 Lomb Memorial
        Drive) and are "not significantly north or south of each other." The model
        explicitly states they "have the same address" and are at a "shared location,"
        indicating equality of position as the reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that KGCE
        is part of RIT and they share the same location in Rochester, New York. The
        model states they "are not significantly north or south of each other" and
        "one cannot be definitively considered south of the other based on their shared
        city location." This indicates the model is saying NO because the locations
        are essentially the same/equal, not because one is north/south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that one location is not
        south of the other based on its analysis.

        north or south of each other" and that it's "challenging to make a definitive
        determination" without more detailed information. The model indicates uncertainty
        about their relative positions rather than equality, which is not the same
        as stating they are equal or identical.

        indicates the model is saying NO because the locations are essentially the
        same in terms of north-south orientation.

        in the same city (Milledgeville), but it doesn't explicitly claim they have
        identical geographical positions. The model's reasoning is that they are "not
        significantly north or south of each other" which implies some potential difference,
        just not a significant one that would make one "distinctly south" of the other.
        This is not the same as stating they have equal coordinates.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Vienna being north of Charles Town. The model's reasoning
        indicates the universities are in different locations, not that they are equal
        or the same. The "NO" answer contradicts the model's own reasoning, but it
        does not claim equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which directly contradicts its own reasoning. In its step-by-step analysis,
        the model concluded that "Ohio Valley University is located north of American
        Military University," but then gave "NO" as the final answer. This creates
        a contradiction, but since we're instructed to take the explicit final answer
        at face value, the answer is NO.

        states "Syracuse University in Syracuse, New York, is northeast of Wisconsin
        Lutheran College in Milwaukee, Wisconsin" and "Syracuse, New York, is east
        of the longitude of Milwaukee, Wisconsin," which shows the locations are different,
        not equal.

        (Tallahassee). The model states "they are not significantly north or south
        of each other" and implies they share the same location. This indicates the

        are equal. In fact, it specifically notes a difference, stating "Wahpeton,
        North Dakota, is slightly north of the latitude of Fergus Falls, Minnesota."
        The model indicates there is a directional difference (one is north of the
        other), even if it describes this difference as "relatively small." Since
        the model notes a directional difference rather than equality, this does not
        qualify as equal values.

        State College of Science in Wahpeton, North Dakota" and that "Fergus Falls
        is not south of Wahpeton." The model is indicating a directional difference

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are exactly equal. Rather, it states that "we can't accurately
        determine which one is south of the other based solely on their shared city
        location." The model is indicating uncertainty about the relative positions,
        not that they are at the exact same location or coordinates. It's saying the
        difference is minimal and can't be determined from the information available,
        not that they are at identical positions.

        but in different neighborhoods (University of Miami in Coral Gables and Miami
        International University in downtown Miami). It even mentions that "Coral
        Gables is located slightly southwest of downtown Miami." The model concludes
        NO because it believes the difference in their locations "is not significant
        enough to determine a clear 'south' relationship" - not because they are in
        exactly the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are at exactly the same location, it implies they are likely in close proximity
        without a clear north-south distinction. The model does not assert any directional
        difference between them, suggesting they are effectively in the same location
        for the purposes of the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that Washington
        Technology University appears to be fictional or non-existent, and therefore
        it cannot determine its relative position to Antioch University Seattle. The
        model explicitly states "we can't accurately determine its relative position"
        due to lack of information, not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer to the comparative question. While the model
        acknowledges that Washington Technology University appears to be fictional
        or non-existent, it still provides a definitive "NO" answer rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same - it gave what I've classified as UNKNOWN because one of the entities
        is fictional.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model's reasoning indicates it cannot make the comparison because
        Washington Technology University is fictional, and it doesn't have a specific
        location for it. This means the model is rejecting the premise of the question
        by stating one of the entities doesn't exist, which qualifies as UNKNOWN according
        to the criteria.

        of locations.

        Wind River Tribal College is not south of Grand Valley State University."
        The model is saying NO because of a directional difference (Wind River is

        that "Grand Valley State University in Allendale, Michigan, is northeast of
        Wind River Tribal College in Ethete, Wyoming." The model is saying NO because
        of this directional relationship, not because the locations are at the same

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that both
        institutions are part of the same university and located in the same city,
        with "no meaningful distinction in terms of their geographical position relative
        to each other." This indicates the model is saying they are essentially in
        the same location, not that one is in any direction from the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that both entities are in the same location. It explicitly states "they are
        essentially in the same location" and "they are in the same general location"
        as the reason for its NO answer. The model is indicating that the values being
        compared (the locations) are the same, which is why it concludes NO.

        that the College of Sciences is part of Angelo State University and they share
        the same location. The model explicitly states "they share the same location"
        and that the College of Sciences "is a part of the same university." This
        indicates the model is saying the locations are the same/identical, and this
        equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are not located south or north of each other, but rather, they are in the
        same location" and "they share the same campus location." The model's reasoning
        is that the values being compared (the locations) are exactly the same, which
        is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are at the same location or have equal geographical positions. Instead, it
        states they are "relatively close to each other" and "not significantly north
        or south of each other in a way that would make one distinctly south of the
        other." This indicates proximity but not equality, and the model is expressing
        uncertainty about their exact relative positions rather than stating they

        for its NO answer, stating "Immaculata is northwest of St. Davids" which implies
        a directional difference between the locations. This difference in position
        is the reason for the NO answer, not equality of values.

        Davids and Immaculata are both in Pennsylvania, but they are not the same
        city or town. They are separate locations within the state." The model gives
        a NO answer because Eastern University is not south of Immaculata University,
        not because they are in the same location.

        New Mexico, is north of the latitude of Los Angeles, California, it is not

        are not significantly north or south of each other." This indicates the model
        believes the locations are essentially at the same position (not that one
        is north or south of the other), making this a case where the values being
        compared are considered the same.

        - it states that New Jersey is east of Pennsylvania, not south. Additionally,
        the model notes that "there is no specific Lincoln Group of Schools in New
        Jersey," suggesting the comparison itself may be problematic, but this is
        not the same as saying the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        part. The model concludes that Anaheim University is north of Trident University
        International, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Anaheim University
        is north of Trident University International" and therefore answers "NO" to
        what appears to be a question about whether Anaheim University is south of
        Trident University International.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference,
        stating that "Oakland City, Indiana, is significantly north of Rohnert Park,
        California." The model is claiming there is a clear directional difference
        between the locations, not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Oakland City University, IN, is located south of Sonoma State University,
        CA. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Oakland City, Indiana, is
        northeast of Rohnert Park, California" which indicates a directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional relationship,
        not on equality of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: 'The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific reason
        for the NO answer: "Oakland City University is located in Indiana, which is
        further east and slightly north compared to California, it is not located
        south of Sonoma State University in California." The model is noting a difference
        in locations (one being "east and slightly north" compared to the other),
        not equality.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that Oakland City University
        is not located south of Sonoma State University based on its geographical
        analysis.
