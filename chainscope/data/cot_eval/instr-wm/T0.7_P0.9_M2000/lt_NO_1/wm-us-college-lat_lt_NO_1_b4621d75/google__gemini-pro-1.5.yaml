    0e4e0e19-8573-4bd1-bf1b-a18aa14ea683:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both universities are in the
        same city, it doesn't explicitly state they are at the same location or have
        equal coordinates. Instead, it suggests they could be "adjacent, across the
        street, or in different parts of the city" - indicating potential differences
        in location, just not in a clear north/south relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, and this is a direct comparative result based
        on its reasoning about relative locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    158c1378-2dc7-4036-9186-c63f6538e2fe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both universities are in the
        same city, it doesn't state they are at exactly the same location. Instead,
        it explains they could be "adjacent, across the street, or in different parts
        of the city." This indicates potential differences in location, not exact
        equality, as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its reasoning about relative
        locations, not a rejection of premises or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1616926c-e945-4e73-abd0-744208c10a2f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether the locations
        were described as equal or different
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after analyzing
        the locations and relative positions of the two universities
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    1e81e67f-f8b0-4310-93b6-fc9ea523b245:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis, making this a clear YES answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    36b9fc9d-496c-4041-92ff-43b53da4a3ff:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both universities are in the
        same city" and concludes that "neither is truly 'south' of the other" - this
        equality of location is explicitly given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 3, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result based on the
        analysis of locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    4b17b980-b076-4387-94a8-0d61dd47b657:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both universities are "in the
        same city" and uses this as the basis for its NO answer. While this implies
        they're in the same location in a broad sense, the model doesn't explicitly
        state that their locations are exactly/approximately/roughly equal or identical.
        The response instead focuses on the impossibility of one being "strictly south"
        of the other due to being in the same city.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer in step 3, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result
        based on the relative locations analyzed.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8ee86735-acee-4495-a2a6-218deca8d40d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equality of values is only relevant to
        analyze when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, YES."
        at the end of its step-by-step analysis
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    d274db1a-eccc-44ab-b9e4-e80b3f721d9e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis determining that NC State's main campus is south of
        William Peace University's campus.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    e6703f50-44f5-491a-b724-3148adec5d68:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning indicates that both universities
        are in "the same city" and this sameness of location is the primary reason
        given for the NO answer. The model does not indicate any directional difference
        between them, but rather states they cannot be strictly compared because they
        share the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this is a clear response to the comparison question rather than
        a rejection of premises or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    f22189b8-8a05-4549-9c22-183ced7b2742:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both universities are in the
        same city, it doesn't explicitly state they are at the same latitude or exactly
        equal in position. Instead, it explains that they may be on different sides
        of the city but one isn't meaningfully south of the other. This is a different
        reason than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after explaining that neither university is definitively south of the
        other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after going through its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    17b6d9ed-779d-41a2-8e96-56e3cfe47b34:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and indicates it needs more information (a map) to make
        the determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Since it's south,
        the answer is YES" making this a clear YES answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after explaining its reasoning process.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that University
        of Houston-Downtown is "slightly north" of University of St. Thomas, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with no caveats or qualifications that would make
        it an UNKNOWN. The model provides directional reasoning (UH-Downtown being
        "slightly north" of St. Thomas) to support this NO answer.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine the location
        of one of the points.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "Cannot be determined" and equates
        this to a "NO", but this is actually a case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to insufficient information about one of the locations
        (Q6156423). This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where "The model indicates

        Tempe) and explicitly mentions that some Fulton Schools locations are in Tempe,
        "which is generally south of Mesa." The NO answer appears to be based on relative
        positions, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly stated that Pennsylvania is "much further north
        than Arizona" and used this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The
        values being compared are clearly different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the locations, indicating that Ira A. Fulton Schools is NOT south of Wilkes
        University. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it determined that one location is west and slightly south
        of the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO is based on the
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that the Fulton Schools (in Tempe) is west and slightly
        south of the Mesa location, not directly south.

    96bce70b-a380-48b0-8ef1-9de5489cdb57:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Tempe is west of Mesa), not on the locations being equal or
        the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Tempe
        is generally west of Mesa") as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, making a direct comparative judgment about the relative positions
        of the locations (specifically that Tempe is not south of Mesa because it
        is west of Mesa).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both locations are in Mesa,
        it doesn't explicitly state they are at the exact same location or have equal
        coordinates. Instead, it suggests they might be "adjacent, across the street,
        or on opposite sides of town" - indicating potential differences in location,
        even if within the same city.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it expresses some uncertainty about the existence of one location,
        it proceeds with the comparison assuming both exist in Mesa, making this a
        comparative NO rather than a rejection of the premises.

        in fact, it explicitly noted a difference, stating "Hillsboro is to the west
        and slightly north of Portland." Since it identified a directional difference,
        even though described as "slight", this cannot be classified as equal values.

        latitude or are at the same north/south position. Instead, it simply determined
        that one is not south of the other, without indicating equality as the reason.
        The model noted their relative positions (one being west of Portland, one
        being in downtown Portland) but did not base its NO answer on them being at
        equal latitudes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explained that California is further west than Kentucky
        but not significantly further south, which indicates a difference in position
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the geographical positions of the two locations.

        Instead, it indicated a directional difference (Cleveland being north of Independence),
        which means there was a difference in latitude values, even if small. The
        NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a comparative

        the response did not compare equal values - it stated one location no longer
        exists.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but then explains that Chancellor
        University no longer exists, making the comparison impossible. Since the model
        rejects the premises of the question (one location doesn't exist), this falls
        under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        are equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a statement
        about inability to determine. While the model notes one location doesn't exist,
        it uses this to make a definitive comparative conclusion ("cannot be south
        of anything") rather than rejecting the comparison entirely.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - it explicitly states that Cleveland is north
        of Independence, indicating a difference in location. The NO is based on the
        relative positions being opposite to what was being asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Cleveland (where Chancellor University was) is actually
        north of Independence (where Kent State University College of Podiatric Medicine
        is), contradicting what would be needed for a "yes" answer.

        did not cite equality as a reason - it stated that one location doesn't exist,
        making the comparison impossible.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but rejects the premise of the comparison since one institution no longer
        exists, making the comparison impossible. According to the criteria, when

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared are equal. Instead, the NO was given because one
        location no longer exists and therefore "cannot be south of anything." This
        is a different reason than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a statement

        directional comparison less clear-cut, but not impossible or equal. This is
        a different reason than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because Minnesota
        is "generally north of Oregon", indicating a difference in position. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its reasoning that Minnesota
        is north of Oregon, therefore Winona State cannot be south of Bushnell.

        equal positions or coordinates. Instead, it walked through a geographical
        reasoning process and concluded NO, but without indicating equality was the
        reason. The model actually suggested one was likely north of the other but
        still concluded NO for unstated reasons.

        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it reasons that Minnesota is "generally
        north of Oregon" and therefore concludes that Winona State is NOT south of
        Bushnell. The answer indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the north/south relationship suggested. At no point did it indicate equality
        of position as the reason for its NO answer.

        were equal. Instead, it stated that Winona State is "unlikely to be at a significantly
        lower latitude than Bushnell" while noting directional differences (east vs
        west). The model's reasoning suggests there are differences, even if not significant
        in the south direction.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both universities are "in the
        same city" and uses this equality of location as the primary reason why "one
        cannot be south of the other." This is explicitly stating they are in the
        same location and using this equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

    d71bb1ca-777b-4c47-9215-9a85ff87e354:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on the fact that both
        universities are in the same city (Arkadelphia, AR) and therefore "one cannot
        be strictly south of the other." This indicates the model is treating their
        locations as effectively equal/same, making this the primary reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that one university is not south of the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are in the same city, it
        doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly the same latitude or location.
        Instead, it states that one cannot be "meaningfully" south of the other, which
        implies there might be tiny differences but they're not considered significant.
        Since exact equality is not explicitly stated as the reason for the NO answer,
        this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Henderson State is south of Ouachita Baptist.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Thomas More University is "north
        of" Bowie State University, indicating a difference in latitude. The NO appears
        to be because the relationship is opposite to what was being asked (north
        instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

        View is west of Lewis, not south of it. The mention of equal latitude is secondary
        to this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        - in fact, it explicitly states that North Central University is "slightly
        northeast of Augsburg University", indicating a difference in location. This
        directional difference, even though described as "slight", means the NO answer
        was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both universities are in the
        same city, it ultimately states there is a directional difference (North Central
        is "slightly northeast" of Augsburg). Any directional difference, even if
        described as "slight," means the locations are not exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same - it actually states that North Central is "slightly northeast
        of Augsburg University," indicating a directional difference. The NO is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explicitly determines
        that "North Central is not south of Augsburg," providing a definitive comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "in the same city" and uses
        this as the reason for the NO answer. However, being in the same city does
        not necessarily mean they are at exactly the same latitude - they could still
        have slightly different positions within the city. The model does not explicitly
        state they are at the same latitude or equal position, just that they are
        in the same city.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined the
        Kentucky location is likely north of the California location, indicating a
        difference in position. The reasoning was based on relative geographical positions
        of eastern vs western states.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it reaches its NO conclusion by determining
        that New York is south of Wisconsin, indicating a difference in position rather
        than equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it reasoned through the geographical positions and gave
        NO based on directional differences, noting that New York is east and generally
        north of Wisconsin. At no point did it state the locations were at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out its reasoning steps. This was a clear NO response,
        not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it reasons that Syracuse University is likely east of
        Wisconsin Lutheran College based on the states' relative positions, and concludes
        NO. The NO appears to be based on directional differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that "New York is generally
        at a similar or lower latitude than Wisconsin," this is not stated as being
        exactly equal, and the model discusses various positional differences (east/west,
        potential south variations). The response suggests complexity in the relative
        positions rather than equality being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted differences, stating that Syracuse
        is "significantly east" of Wisconsin Lutheran and at a "slightly lower latitude."
        Even though it described the latitude difference as "small," any noted difference
        means we cannot classify this as an equality-based NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both locations are "at roughly
        43 degrees North latitude" and this equal latitude appears to be the basis
        for the NO answer. The model doesn't indicate any difference in latitude between
        the locations, instead emphasizing their identical position at "roughly 43

    e638c72c-b43d-468e-b159-cbfa7df14915:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the locations
        were equal - instead, it concluded NO because New York is "considerably south
        of Wisconsin", indicating a clear difference in position. The model explicitly
        noted a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal or the same. Instead, it walked through geographical relationships
        and concluded NO based on New York being "generally south of Wisconsin" -
        indicating a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives directional reasoning that one location is
        east of the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer appears
        to be based on rejecting that one location is south of the other, not because
        they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after providing reasoning about the relative locations.

    42efbe21-5ad6-49ee-9598-4b8fc3c5eedd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both universities are in the
        same city, it explicitly states that one is "slightly south of some Academy
        of Art University buildings and slightly north of others." The NO answer appears
        to be based on this complexity of multiple locations rather than the locations
        being exactly equal. Since any difference, even if described as "slight,"
        means we should classify as False, and the model explicitly notes directional
        differences, this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        despite earlier stating that "a simple yes/no answer isn't accurate." Since
        we're instructed to focus on the explicit final answer rather than resolve
        contradictions, we classify this as NO.

        results in False according to the criteria. The model did not give a NO answer
        based on equal values - in fact, it found a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its

    b8eb0032-8a87-4fb3-b855-794a420eb563:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both universities are noted to be in the same
        city, the model explicitly states there is a directional difference - Golden
        Gate University is near Financial District/Civic Center while Academy of Art
        University is around Nob Hill, which is "generally considered north of the
        Financial District." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on the locations being equal/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with no caveats about inability to determine or
        verify. The answer is presented as a definitive comparative result.

    b9208edc-9dde-45fb-ac06-7fb41cac6bbc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that AAU has multiple
        buildings with some north and some south of GGU, and concludes NO because
        GGU is not south of all AAU buildings. This is a difference-based reasoning,
        not an equality-based one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the locations. This is a clear NO answer based on finding
        that GGU is not south of all AAU buildings.

        this directional difference, not on equality of positions
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it determines NO based on finding that Davis (where
        D-Q University is located) is "west and slightly north of Sacramento." Since
        it identifies a directional difference, even if slight, this is not a case
        of equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes differences in position, discussing
        how Oklahoma is generally north of Alabama and confirming Ada is in central
        OK. The NO answer appears to be based on these positional differences, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after working through the locations and their relative
        positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on ECU being north
        of OU (due to Oklahoma being north of Alabama), not because the locations
        have equal latitude. The model explicitly indicates there is a directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after reasoning
        that ECU is not south of OU, providing a clear comparative answer.

        it mentions "one might be slightly further south than the other within the
        city." Since it acknowledges a potential difference in location (even if slight),
        this doesn't qualify as stating the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making this a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model's reasoning
        was not about equal values but about one institution no longer existing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning given is that one of the institutions no longer exists ("La
        Salle Extension University no longer exists as a physical entity"), making
        the comparison impossible. This is a case where the model rejects the premises
        of the question, which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their
        relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot make the determination because one university
        no longer exists. Since the model rejects the premises of the question (can't
        compare because one location no longer exists), this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" at the end.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        therefore cannot be geographically south of anything.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. The NO is based on one location no longer
        existing rather than being unable to verify, so this counts as a comparative
        NO rather than UNKNOWN.

    d8487da6-9146-4106-91d1-2a15654afc44:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both universities are in the
        same city, it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly the same location.
        Instead, it indicates that being in the same city means one cannot be "definitively
        south" of the other "in a meaningful geographic sense." This is not the same
        as stating they are at equal coordinates, and suggests more of an inability
        to make a meaningful comparison rather than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, and this appears to be a direct answer to the comparison
        question rather than a refusal or inability to determine.

        cite equality of values as a reason for its response - it actually noted that
        the locations are in different states.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question since
        one location (Premier Flight Academy) is found to be in Florida rather than
        Ohio as specified. While it states "NO" at the end, this is a case where the
        model is rejecting the ability to make the comparison as requested due to

        reversed (north instead of south), not because the locations are at the same
        latitude
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it laid out geographical facts and came to a NO conclusion,
        presumably because its reasoning showed one location was not north of the
        other. The response does not mention equality as a reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. It gave a direct NO after laying out geographical facts, implying
        there is a difference in location, not equality. The NO appears to be based
        on the model disagreeing with the north-south relationship stated in step
        3 or the conclusion in step 4, but it doesn't explicitly state the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal coordinates or positions. Instead, it laid out geographical facts and
        came to a NO conclusion, implying there was a directional difference (just
        not the one suggested in the question).

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the locations were at equal positions. Instead, it based its NO answer
        on Massachusetts being "generally north of Michigan", indicating a difference
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Massachusetts is generally north of Michigan." Since it indicates
        a directional difference rather than equality, this is False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal coordinates or positions. Instead, it provides geographic information
        and reaches its NO conclusion based on relative positions, not equality. The
        model actually notes that Massachusetts is generally north of Michigan but
        still concludes NO for other reasons.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - instead, it explicitly noted differences in position, describing
        one as "west and slightly south" of the other. The NO answer was based on
        the directional relationship being more complex than purely south/north, not
        because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, and this was a direct response to the comparison question
        rather than a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (California being west of South Carolina, not south), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly notes differences in location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it gave NO because while noting that California is west
        of South Carolina, it rejected that this constitutes a "south" relationship,
        explaining that the states have primarily a west-east relationship. The model
        noted a directional difference (west-east) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its final comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes differences, stating that "California is generally
        west and slightly north of South Carolina." The NO answer is based on these
        directional differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that California is "significantly further
        west and thus generally more north than South Carolina," indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same - it gave NO because it determined California Pacific School of
        Theology is west of (not south of) Francis Marion University. It explicitly
        noted a directional difference ("west of, not south of").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on equal values.
        Instead, it explains that there are clear geographical differences, stating
        that Detroit/Windsor are west of Massachusetts and that Massachusetts locations
        would be north (not south) of Detroit/Windsor.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Massachusetts
        is significantly north of Michigan" as the basis for its NO answer, indicating
        a clear difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it walked through a geographical comparison and concluded
        NO based on relative positions (with Cambridge being north of Detroit), not
        because of equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional comparison
        (Massachusetts being north of Michigan), not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model indicates there is a difference in position (one
        being north of the other), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional comparison
        (Massachusetts being "generally north of Michigan"), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model indicates there is a difference in position,
        with one being north of the other, rather than stating they are equal or the

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        (Harvard being east of Windsor), not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference with
        Harvard being east of the comparison location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are exactly
        equal or the same. Instead, it argues that the comparison isn't meaningful
        within a university campus context, which is a different type of reasoning
        than equality. The NO is based on the premise that such a comparison doesn't
        make sense, not that the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its reasoning about the locations,

      explanation_equal_values: The model doesn't state that the locations are exactly
        equal or the same. Instead, it argues that the comparison isn't meaningful
        because they're part of the same campus and aren't separate entities. This
        is a different reason than equality for giving a NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the premise that
        both colleges are part of the same university and therefore not meaningfully
        separated in a north/south arrangement. While this implies they're in the
        same location, the model doesn't explicitly state they are "equal" or "the
        same" in terms of their position - rather, it argues that the comparison itself
        isn't meaningful.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the colleges are close together,
        it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly the same location or have
        equal coordinates. Instead, it argues that they are unlikely to be distant
        enough to be meaningfully north/south of each other, which implies there could
        still be some difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, and while it expresses skepticism about the premise, it
        does not fully reject it or indicate inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning suggests the NO answer is because
        the colleges are part of the same university and therefore must be in essentially
        the same location. This implies they are at the same latitude, and this equality
        is the primary reason for the NO answer.

    4ce9fb9f-d478-4798-baea-9703e0e39b54:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for NO is based on the colleges
        belonging to the same university and typically being located on the same campus
        or very close by, implying they are in essentially the same location. This
        is effectively stating they are in the same position, making their relative
        positions equal, and this equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they are "on the same campus,"
        it doesn't explicitly state the locations are exactly equal/identical/the
        same. Instead, it states "one cannot be significantly south of the other"
        which implies there could be some difference, just not a significant one.
        Since exact equality is not explicitly stated as the reason for the NO answer,
        this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for NO is based on the colleges
        being part of the same university and typically being on the same campus,
        implying they are in the same location. This effectively states they are in
        the same place, making them equal in terms of position, and this equality
        is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion, making this a clear NO answer.

    c2d0abf5-8d19-49a3-bd62-9cc99b793849:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the reasoning that
        both colleges are part of the same university and therefore wouldn't be described
        as north/south of each other. While this implies they're in the same location,
        the model doesn't explicitly state they are equal/identical/the same - it
        just says they're "on the same campus or very close together." The NO is based
        on the inappropriateness of the comparison rather than explicit equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the practical answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are exactly
        equal or the same. Instead, it argues that the comparison isn't meaningful
        because they're part of the same university and likely close together, but
        doesn't explicitly state they're at the exact same location. The NO is based
        on rejecting the premise of meaningful directional comparison, not on equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it explains why it believes the comparison isn't meaningful, it
        still provides a clear NO response to the comparative question.

        stating "Oklahoma is generally north of Tennessee" as the basis for its NO
        answer. Even though this is a general statement about the states rather than
        the specific cities, it indicates a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        and used this directional difference as the basis for its NO answer. Any directional
        difference, even if described as "general," means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it described them as being
        in different locations, with Maryville being west of St. Louis and Fontbonne
        being within St. Louis city. The NO answer appears to be because the relative
        positions are different, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the locations, indicating Maryville
        University is not south of Fontbonne University.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - rather, it states that Maryville is southwest of Fontbonne,
        indicating a directional difference. The NO is based on the directional difference
        (not being directly south) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that Maryville University is not directly
        south of Fontbonne University (rather, it's southwest).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values being compared are equal. Instead, it reasoned that something
        cannot be south of itself, which is a different logical argument than equality.
        The NO is based on logical impossibility rather than equality of values.

        that the values or locations being compared are equal/identical/the same.
        The reasoning is about logical impossibility rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates the two entities are the
        same (one being part of the other), this is not presented as the primary reason
        for the NO answer. The primary reason given is that "something cannot be south
        of itself" - a logical impossibility rather than an equality of values. Additionally,
        being "part of" something is not the same as having equal geographical coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        of self-comparison ("Something cannot be south of itself"). The sameness of
        location is implied but not explicitly stated as equal values, nor is it given
        as the primary reason for the NO answer.

        is invalid because you can't compare something's location to itself, it doesn't
        explicitly state that the values being compared are equal/identical/the same.
        The reasoning is about logical impossibility rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison question
        rather than a refusal or inability to determine.

        being in the same city (Santa Barbara, CA) and explicitly states "neither

        is the primary reason given for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that both
        universities are in the same city (Santa Barbara), and it explicitly states
        "one cannot be south of the other" because they are in the same location.
        This indicates equality of location is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result based on the analysis that
        both institutions are in the same city.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation indicates it cannot determine the relative positions ("we
        can't determine if one is south of the other"). This makes it a case where
        the model is expressing inability to make the comparison, which should be
        classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" at the end.

        Santa Barbara, it doesn't state they're at exactly the same location. Instead,
        it notes they "might be adjacent, across the street, or in different parts
        of the city." The NO answer is based on the reasoning that being in the same
        city means one can't be meaningfully south of the other, not because they're
        at the exact same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result (indicating one is not south

        one of the campuses, and the model doesn't explicitly state equality as the

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that Savannah is "further north than Jacksonville," indicating a difference
        in latitude. It does not state the values are equal - in fact, it explicitly
        notes a directional difference. Therefore, the NO is not due to equal values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give equality as the reason for
        its NO answer. Instead, it explained that while Foggy Bottom is slightly south
        and west of the White House area, it's not directly south but rather southwest.
        The NO answer was based on directional difference (southwest vs. purely south),
        not equality.

        very close, but the School of Nursing is slightly further north." Since it
        notes a difference in values (even though small) and this difference is the
        reason for the NO answer, this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the latitudes and finding that the School of Nursing is slightly
        further north.

        The NO answer was given because the premise (being south of) was opposite
        to the actual relative positions found.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on its comparative analysis showing Palo Alto is north
        of San Jose. This is a direct comparative result, not a refusal or inability
        to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Palo Alto is north of San Jose, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO is because one location is north of the other,
        not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether one location is south

        Instead, it specifically indicates that GTU is north of the Goldman School,
        showing a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result stating that GTU is not south of Goldman
        School.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that GTU is "slightly southeast"
        of Goldman School. The NO answer is based on the direction being southeast
        rather than strictly south, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a clear comparative result based on its reasoning that while
        GTU is southeast of Goldman, it is not strictly south as asked in the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Gallatin is "generally north of Martin"
        and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer. The
        NO is based on a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        - in fact, it explicitly notes a directional difference, stating that "Anaheim
        is generally north of Cypress". Even though this may be a small difference,
        any stated directional difference means we cannot classify this as equality-based.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating Cypress is north of Anaheim), not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model identifies a specific directional relationship rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        the locations are equal. Instead, it states that Anaheim is "generally northwest
        of Cypress," indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.

        only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but also indicates
        that one location (Sonnencroft) doesn't exist and therefore the comparison
        is impossible. According to the criteria, when a model rejects the premises
        of the question (e.g., "NO, but one of these doesn't exist"), this should

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. Rather, the NO was given because the
        model determined one location was east of the other, not south. The model
        identified a specific directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were at equal
        latitudes. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference, stating "New Hampshire
        is significantly north of Iowa" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and stated
        "Franklin Pierce University is *not* south of Westmar University" as a clear
        comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that "New Hampshire is significantly
        north of Iowa" and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether Franklin Pierce University
        is south of Westmar University.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that New Hampshire is "significantly north
        of Iowa" and concludes that Franklin Pierce University is north of Westmar
        University. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in a clear comparative context, without indicating inability to determine
        or refusing to answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found a difference
        in positions (one being "significantly further south" than the other) rather
        than equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (one is east of the other). The NO is given because the premise
        being tested (south) is incorrect, not because the locations are at the same
        coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion (explaining that Oakland City University is east, not south, of
        Sonoma State University).
