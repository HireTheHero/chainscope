      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because NC State is northeast of
        William Peace University, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states there is a directional difference (northeast vs south), not equality
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

    06c49eaa-d1e8-4c45-b50f-0f61df3b2eac:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal/same
        - it explicitly states NC State is "further north" and William Peace is "more
        centrally/slightly south of NC State". The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative result indicating NC State is NOT south of William

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (NC State being northeast of William Peace), not because the locations are
        equal. It explicitly states there is a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" and provides a direct comparative result based on relative positions (northeast

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that NC State is north of William
        Peace University, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative result, indicating that NC State is NOT south

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this wasn't because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that "NC State is actually north of William Peace University" - indicating
        a difference in position, not equality. The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing the comparative question of whether NC State is south
        of William Peace University. The answer is definitive and explicitly states
        "NC State is NOT south of William Peace University."
      final_answer: 'NO'

    b07097e9-e575-4705-a01f-e4a68a5c977a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that NC
        State is actually north of William Peace University, not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states "NC State is north of William Peace
        University in Raleigh" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative result, indicating that NC State is NOT south
        of William Peace University. This is a clear NO answer to the comparison.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that NC State University
        is located north of William Peace University, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about uncertainty or inability
        to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d937667b-3f50-466a-ae62-805099d330b3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - in fact, it explicitly states that NC State University is NORTH
        of William Peace University, indicating different positions. The NO appears
        to be in response to some unstated original question, but clearly indicates
        a difference rather than equality in positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of
        the two universities.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly stated NC State is north
        of William Peace, indicating a directional difference. The NO was because
        the direction was opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly worked through the relative positions
        and explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative answer, indicating NC
        State is north (not south) of William Peace.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f6f64bb7-c4f8-4a54-b7ee-45a2e70e7bd0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (NC State being north of William Peace), not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly states one is north while the other is central/downtown,
        indicating different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative result, indicating NC State is NOT south of

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (one being north of
        the other, rather than south). The model explicitly states "the Southwest
        Recreation Center is actually north of the Cancer and Genetics Research Complex."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its analysis that the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (northwest vs south), not because the locations are equal or the
        same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, based on finding that one location is northwest
        (not south) of the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since this only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, my

    d29cef2b-381e-451b-ba29-81ca07ee8670:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Recreation Center being north of the Complex), not because the locations
        are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear directional reasoning (Recreation Center
        is north of the Complex, therefore not south)

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        equality comparisons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer due to insufficient information" because it cannot find one
        of the locations. This indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        equality comparisons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer due to insufficient information" and explains it cannot verify
        one location. This indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't verify one of
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and explains that it cannot make the comparison because one
        of the locations cannot be verified. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a comparison of equal values since it couldn't verify one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains this is because one of the locations (Kingston
        University) appears to be non-existent. This is a case where the model rejects
        the premises of the question due to one location not existing.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any equality comparisons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" because it cannot verify one location. This indicates
        inability to make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and explains this is because Kingston University doesn't exist,
        making the comparison impossible. This is a case where the model rejects the
        premises of the question since one location doesn't exist.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot make the comparison because one
        location is unknown. This fits the UNKNOWN criteria where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

        automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless of
        the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "CANNOT DETERMINE" and
        explains it cannot verify the comparison because one of the locations (Kingston
        University) appears to not exist or cannot be found. This falls under the
        UNKNOWN category as the model rejects the premises by indicating one location
        doesn't exist.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explains that Boyer College is part of Temple
        University and on the same campus, and this is used to explain why one cannot
        be south of the other. This effectively states they are in the same location,
        and this equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 5 and once as a final standalone answer.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Boyer College and Temple University
        are at "exactly the same" location, and this equality is the primary basis
        for concluding NO (since something cannot be south of itself). This matches
        the criteria for True - the values being compared are explicitly stated to
        be equal, and this equality is the main reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer about the relative
        location.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for NO is that Boyer College
        is ON/part of Temple University's campus, not that they are at the same location.
        While this implies they share a location, the model's primary reasoning is
        that Boyer College cannot be south of Temple because it is part of it, not
        because they have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion and once as a standalone answer. This is a definitive
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Rather, it concludes NO because Boyer College
        is part of Temple University and therefore cannot be south of it. The reasoning
        is about physical impossibility due to being part of the same campus, not
        about equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its reasoning about relative

        The reasoning is about physical impossibility due to being part of the same
        entity, not about equal coordinates or positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates Boyer College is part of
        Temple University's campus and "in the same location," this is not presented
        as a reason for equality but rather as context for why Boyer cannot be south
        of Temple. The model's reasoning is that Boyer College cannot be south of
        Temple because it is part of Temple's campus, not because they are at the
        exact same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" and
        reaffirms "NO, Boyer College of Music and Dance is not located south of Temple
        University, PA." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because one of the locations doesn't exist as specified
        ("appears to be fictitious"). When a model rejects the premises of the question,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

        (stating that one location is northwest while the other is more central),
        not because the locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly notes
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its

        is opposite to what was asked (north instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step analysis

        locations are equal. The model explicitly states that Abilene (where McMurry
        is) is "west and slightly south of Shreveport," indicating a difference in
        position. The NO answer is because the model concludes McMurry is actually
        north of LSU Shreveport, not because they're at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether McMurry University is located south of LSU Shreveport.

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Abilene is "west
        of Shreveport" and "somewhat north of Shreveport" - indicating a difference
        in position, not equality. The NO is based on directional difference, not
        equality.

        University is actually north of LSU Shreveport (opposite of what was presumably
        asked), not because the locations are at the same latitude. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying that Abilene is "north of Shreveport" and "west of Shreveport."
        Since the NO answer was based on a directional difference (being north instead
        of south) rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result, stating that McMurry University
        is "NOT located south of LSU Shreveport" because it is actually north of Shreveport.

        The NO is because the direction is different from what was asked (north instead
        of south), not because the locations are at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        (east vs. south), not because the locations are at the same coordinates. The
        model explicitly states there is a difference in position (one is east of
        the other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that New York is
        "north of Michigan" - indicating a difference in latitude, not equality. The
        NO is based on the direction being opposite to what was asked (north instead
        of south).

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Ohio Valley University
        is "north of American Military University" - indicating a difference in position,
        with the NO answer being because the relationship is opposite to what was
        asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

        because the locations are equal/same/identical - rather, it states that North
        Central University is "actually northeast of Minneapolis" where Augsburg is
        located. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that American Islamic
        College is "NORTH of Northern Illinois University" - indicating a difference
        in position. The NO appears to be because the relative positions are opposite

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reasoning, explaining that both
        institutions are north of Columbus but not indicating they are at the same
        latitude. The NO answer is based on relative positioning, not equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Sandusky (Premier Flight Academy)
        is north of Cleveland (Mandel School), indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis showing that

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states they are in different
        locations (one northwest, one northeast) and uses this directional difference
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a directional reasoning for why one location is not south of the

        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Premier Flight Academy is explicitly north of Mandel
        School, indicating a directional difference. The model did not claim the locations
        were at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step
        3 and again as a final standalone answer. The model makes a clear directional
        comparison stating that Premier Flight Academy is north of Mandel School,
        not south, leading to this NO answer.

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Sandusky is north
        of Cleveland, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

        the Askew School is NOT south of the FSU College" without specifying whether
        this is due to equality or some other relative position.

        YES or NO answer" and explains that it lacks precise location data to make
        the determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that Tampa is north
        of St. Petersburg and uses this directional difference as the reason for its
        NO answer. The values being compared are different (one is north of the other),
        not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positions. The answer is definitive and addresses the comparison directly.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    57200cb4-86cf-4faf-9157-df62dc779795:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (Tampa is north of
        St. Petersburg). The model explicitly states a difference in position rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical comparison
        showing Tampa is north of St. Petersburg.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is not applicable
        for YES answers
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        and stated "YES, The University of Tampa is located south of Schiller International
        University" in its conclusion'

    83c806cd-ec9d-4bea-863d-155e73dd42d7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Tampa being north of St. Petersburg), not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the
        locations, so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, making a definitive comparative
        judgment that Tampa is north of (not south of) Schiller International University.

    b5ea9ffe-52da-48a8-9376-cce668ea7047:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Tampa is "slightly north of
        St. Petersburg" and explicitly gives this directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer. Even though the locations are described as "very close"
        and in the "same general metropolitan area," the model identifies a specific
        directional difference rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        location.

    b82e083f-843c-4066-aaa3-4676f45d550a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that the relative positions are different (University of Tampa is north of
        Schiller, not south). It does not state that the locations are equal or the
        same - it explicitly states there is a directional difference. The NO is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with "Therefore, the answer is: NO." as its conclusion.
        This is a direct answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determined
        that Tampa is north of St. Petersburg, not because the locations are equal.
        It explicitly states a directional difference between the locations, making
        them unequal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, making a definitive comparative
        judgment about the relative positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values - it simply couldn't make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer due to insufficient information" and explains it cannot determine
        the comparison because one location cannot be verified. This falls under the
        UNKNOWN classification as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    04670865-a95b-42ce-97f5-bf12f17cdf64:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one location's
        coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not have enough
        information to answer this question" and "I cannot definitively determine
        whether Palo Alto University is north or south of it." This indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to missing information about one location.

      result: UNKNOWN
    43d4cac7-3219-4526-ad28-a7c50f1cce61:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer due to insufficient verified information" and explains it cannot
        determine the comparison due to lack of location data for one university.
        This indicates inability to make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    60bc4604-bb2e-44db-9d1c-611cec9725e7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model concluded NO because it
        determined Palo Alto University was north of Henley-Putnam's reference point
        (San Jose), indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Palo Alto
        University is NOT located south of Henley-Putnam University" as a clear comparative
        statement. While the model notes some uncertainty about precise locations,
        it ultimately provides a definitive NO answer based on using San Jose as a
        reference point.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a NO conclusion based on equal values - it simply couldn't make the
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "CANNOT DETERMINE" and
        explains it cannot make the comparison because it lacks location data for
        one of the universities. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model
        indicates it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and concludes with "CANNOT BE DETERMINED" because one of the
        institutions appears to be fictitious. This is a case where the model rejects
        the premises of the question since one location doesn't exist.

        model never claimed the values were equal - it stated one location couldn't
        be determined at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot determine the relative
        position)" and explains it cannot make the comparison because one location
        lacks physical coordinates. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the determination, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are at equal latitudes or the same position. Instead, it
        explains that New Mexico is NOT south of California, implying a different
        relative position. The NO is based on directional difference, not equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Johnstown
        is west/northwest of Harrisburg, indicating a directional difference. The
        NO is based on this directional difference, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        as its final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result based
        on geographical positions (not due to inability to determine or rejection
        of premises).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    76c544db-caa6-4587-a665-99ebdf77657b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly
        states that Johnstown is northwest of Harrisburg, indicating a directional
        difference. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, specifically addressing the comparative relationship.
        The answer is definitive and directly answers whether one location is south
        of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Johnstown being northwest of Harrisburg), not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with one being northwest of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" and "NOT"
        in its conclusion, providing a definitive comparative answer that University
        of Pittsburgh at Johnstown is not south of Harrisburg University.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the
        locations, with one being northwest of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, stating that UPJ is "NOT located south of"
        Harrisburg University. This is a direct NO answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Johnstown was determined to be north of Harrisburg, indicating a directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical comparison showing
        Johnstown is north of Harrisburg, not south.'

        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the NO was given because Johnstown
        was explicitly stated to be north of Harrisburg, indicating a difference in
        location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical analysis showing
        that Johnstown is north of Harrisburg, not south.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Johnstown
        is northwest of Harrisburg, indicating a directional difference (not equality).
        The NO is because the direction is opposite to what was asked (north instead
        of south), not because the locations are at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that UPJ is "NOT south of" Harrisburg
        University, making this a clear negative comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the NO was given because the model
        determined Welch College is actually north of UT Martin, indicating a difference
        in position (opposite to what was being asked). The model explicitly states
        "Gallatin is actually NORTH of Martin."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical
        analysis showing that Welch College is north of UT Martin, not south.

        is north of Martin (UT Martin), indicating a difference in position. The NO
        is based on the direction being opposite to what was asked (not being south
        of), not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with directional reasoning leading to that conclusion.

        the locations were equal/same - it explicitly states that Gallatin is north
        of Martin, indicating a directional difference. The NO is based on the opposite
        of what was asked (south vs. north), not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical analysis showing
        Gallatin (Welch College) is north of Martin (UT Martin).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different positions,
        with Gallatin being north of Martin. The NO is given because the premise (Welch
        College being south of UT Martin) is found to be incorrect, not because the
        locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Welch College was determined to be north of UT Martin, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical comparison showing
        Welch College is north of UT Martin, not south.

        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Gallatin (Welch
        College) is north of Martin (UT Martin), indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was given because the direction was opposite to what was being
        asked, not because the locations were at the same latitude.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Rather, it concluded NO because Sonnencroft
        is east of Indiana State University, indicating a different relative position.
        The model never claimed the locations were equal in any dimension.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
