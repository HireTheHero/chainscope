        are equal - it explicitly states they are in different locations (NC State
        in western part, Peace in eastern part). The NO is because NC State is west
        of Peace, not south.

        on the locations being equal/same/identical. Instead, it reasons that Boyer
        College cannot be south of Temple University because it is a part of Temple
        University. This is a different logical basis than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" and

      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates that the locations are not just
        equal, but are actually the same entity (Boyer College being part of Temple
        University). The NO answer is explicitly given because they are the same location/entity,
        not because of any difference between them.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Rather, the reason given is that Boyer College
        is part of Temple University and therefore cannot be south of it. While this
        implies they're in the same location, the model's reasoning is about organizational
        structure rather than spatial equality.

        the NO stems from the logical relationship that one institution is part of
        the other.

        Instead, it explains that Boyer College cannot be south of Temple because
        it is a part of Temple University, which is a different logical relationship
        than equality.

        because Boyer is part of Temple University, it doesn't explicitly state they
        are at the exact same location as the reason for the NO. Rather, the NO is
        based on the logical impossibility of Boyer being south of Temple since it's
        a part of Temple, not because of proven identical coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it cannot verify/determine the location of Q6156423. This

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because the question is "unanswerable due to the invalid reference."
        Since the model is rejecting the premise of the question by stating one location

        historical addresses") rather than stating they are at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, La Salle Extension
        University is not located south of Robert Morris University Illinois" as its
        conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are exactly
        equal or the same. Instead, it indicates they are both in downtown Chicago
        but specifically notes that La Salle "was not significantly south" of Robert
        Morris, implying some difference in location, even if small. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this relative positioning rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates both universities are in
        the same general area of Chicago, it doesn't explicitly state they are at
        exactly the same location or that equality is the reason for the NO answer.
        Instead, it suggests they are in "close proximity" but doesn't claim they're
        at identical locations. The NO appears to be based on the analysis that one
        is not "significantly south" of the other, which implies some difference in
        location, even if small.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final

        equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that both are in Chicago but explicitly
        states it cannot determine their relative positions within the city. The NO
        answer is based on inability to verify the southward relationship, not on
        equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" and
        maintains this position throughout its reasoning. While it mentions uncertainty
        about exact locations, it provides a definitive NO answer rather than refusing

        equal or the same. Instead, it says they are "in the same general metropolitan
        area" but bases its NO answer on there being "no clear evidence that La Salle
        Extension University was located significantly south of" the other institution.
        This indicates uncertainty about relative positions rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        "close proximity" and the "same general area," it doesn't explicitly state
        they are at exactly the same location or that equality is the reason for the
        NO answer. The model simply states it's "not definitively south" which suggests
        uncertainty rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is presented as a comparative result (not a rejection of ability
        to determine or premises)

        "La Salle Extension University is not significantly south of Robert Morris
        University," which implies there is still some difference, even if small.

        institutions are "in the same general area of downtown Chicago" and "it is
        not accurate to say that one is definitively south of the other." This indicates
        they are effectively in the same location, and this equality is the primary
        reason given for the NO answer.

        equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that they are both in Chicago but
        cannot determine their exact relative positions. The NO answer is given because
        there's "no clear evidence" for one being south of the other, not because
        they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result (not as inability to determine).

        a definitive NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being exactly equal or the same. Instead, it states that both are in Chicago
        but indicates uncertainty about their relative positions, noting it's "unlikely
        that one is significantly south of the other." The NO comes from lack of evidence
        for one being south of the other, not from them being at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in bold and as a clear comparative conclusion. While it expresses some
        uncertainty in the reasoning, it does provide a definitive NO answer rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        were equal - it stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because one of the institutions doesn't exist, making it impossible
        to make the comparison. When a model rejects the premises of the question
        by stating one element doesn't exist, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating "Washington
        Technology University, WA does not exist." While it says "NO" explicitly,
        this is a case where the model is rejecting the premise of the question since
        one institution doesn't exist, making comparison impossible. Per the instructions,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal. While it mentions that if comparing to UW "then Antioch University
        Seattle is in the same city," this is not presented as the primary reason
        for the NO answer. Instead, the model states NO because Antioch is northwest
        (not south) of WSU, and for UW it's "not distinctly south of it." Any mention
        of same city location is secondary to the directional comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice - once in the
        conclusion and once as the final answer. This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question, even though it notes uncertainty about one of the institutions.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        a directional difference. The NO answer appears to be based on the difference
        not being "significant" rather than the locations being equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that one location (GMU) exists in Fairfax
        while the other (UNVA) lacks a clear location. The NO answer is based on the
        inability to verify the comparison due to one location being unclear/illegitimate,
        not because the locations are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates the locations are close,
        it explicitly states that Annandale (UNVA) is "slightly southeast of Fairfax
        (GMU)". The NO answer is based on this directional difference being too small
        to be "distinctly south", not because the locations are exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        being "in the same city" and "same general geographic area," implying they
        are at the same location/level. The model explicitly states they are in "the
        same general geographic area" as the reason why one cannot be south of the
        other, making equality the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "they share the same general
        geographic coordinates" and bases its NO answer on them being "in the same
        city." While this implies similarity in location, it does not explicitly state
        they are at exactly/approximately equal coordinates, and being "in the same
        city" does not necessarily mean equal positions. The model's reasoning suggests
        more of an inability to determine meaningful difference rather than explicit
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Fielding Graduate
        University is not located south of Antioch University Santa Barbara" as its
        conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that both
        universities are "in the same general area" and "in the same city," but it
        does not explicitly state they are at exactly the same location or that equality
        is the reason for the NO. Rather, it states that one "cannot be definitively
        described as 'south' of the other," which suggests uncertainty about relative
        positions rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result stating that Fielding Graduate University
        is not located south of Antioch University Santa Barbara.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions both universities are in
        the same city, it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly the same location
        or latitude. Being in the same city doesn't necessarily mean equal coordinates,
        and the model uses language suggesting it can't determine their relative positions
        ("cannot be definitively south") rather than stating they are at the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Fielding Graduate
        University, CA is not located south of Antioch University Santa Barbara, CA"
        as its conclusion, providing a clear NO answer to the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the response wasn't about equal values
        - it was about one location not existing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because Sonnencroft, WV does
        not exist)". Since the model is rejecting the premise of the question because
        one location doesn't exist, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than
        NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that Franklin Pierce University is north of
        Westmar University. The NO answer is given because of this directional difference,
        not because of equality
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that Franklin Pierce University is not
        south of Westmar University (because it's north)

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Franklin Pierce being "farther north"), not because the locations
        are at the same latitude. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative result, indicating that Franklin Pierce University
        is NOT south of Westmar University because it is "farther north."
