      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it couldn't make the comparison at all due to one
        institution allegedly not existing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model is not making a comparative judgment about the locations.
        Instead, it's rejecting the premise of the question by stating that "Kingston
        University LA is not a recognized accredited university in California" and
        therefore "cannot make a valid geographical comparison." This is a case where
        the model is saying NO to the ability to determine the answer rather than
        to the comparative relationship itself.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it couldn't verify the existence of one of the universities.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it's actually rejecting the premise of the question by stating "I cannot
        verify that Charles R. Drew University is south of Kingston University LA
        because the latter does not appear to be a recognized accredited university
        in California." This is a case where the model is saying NO because one of
        the entities in the comparison doesn't exist (or at least the model believes
        it doesn't exist), not because of the actual north-south relationship.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather expressed
        uncertainty about being able to make the comparison at all due to lack of
        information about Kingston University LA.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that Charles R. Drew University is south of Kingston University LA, as I cannot
        verify the location or existence of Kingston University LA in California."
        This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" which indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information about one of
        the entities. The model is not making a comparative determination but rather
        stating its inability to answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that Charles R. Drew University is south of Kingston University LA, because
        Kingston University LA does not appear to be a recognized accredited institution
        in California, and its location cannot be reliably determined." This is a
        case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot confirm" and rejecting the premise
        that one of the universities exists as a legitimate entity. The model is not
        making a definitive comparative statement but rather indicating it cannot
        determine the relationship.

        Instead, it states "Clarion is very slightly south of Bridgeport" and "with
        Clarion being only marginally south if at all." The model is noting a slight
        difference in position, even if it's described as marginal. The NO answer
        is based on the lack of significant difference, not on exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, PennWest Clarion

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reason for saying NO is that "the College
        of Liberal Arts is part of Texas A&M University and located on the same campus,
        neither is south of the other. They occupy the same geographic location."
        This clearly indicates the model is saying NO because the values (locations)
        being compared are the same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reason for saying NO is that the two entities
        share the same geographic location. It explicitly states "they share the same
        geographic location" and "they occupy the same space," indicating that the
        values being compared (their geographic locations) are the same, and this
        equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather rejected
        the premise of the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, but it's rejecting the premise of the question by explaining that
        the College of Liberal Arts is not a separate geographical entity from Texas
        A&M University but rather a subdivision within it. The model is saying the
        comparison cannot be made because one entity is part of the other, not separate
        locations that can be compared directionally.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reason for saying NO is that the two entities
        "share the same physical location" and "occupy the same space." The model
        explicitly states they "are at the same location" as the reason for the NO
        answer. This indicates the values being compared (the locations) are the same,
        which is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Texas A&M University
        is not located south of Texas A&M College of Liberal Arts, TX, because they
        are at the same location." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        geographical sense because the College of Liberal Arts is part of Texas A&M
        University, not a separate geographical institution. The model is rejecting
        the premise of the comparison rather than stating the locations are identical.

        of Liberal Arts is physically located on the Texas A&M University campus,
        meaning they share the same location. The model states "they share the same
        location" and "they occupy the same geographic area," explicitly indicating
        that the values being compared (their locations) are the same, and this equality
        is the primary reason for the NO answer.

        are not separate geographic entities. The College of Liberal Arts is part
        of Texas A&M University and located within the same campus." This indicates
        they share the same location/are in the same place, which is the primary reason
        for the NO answer. The model is stating they are effectively at the same location,
        not that one is north/south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Texas A&M University
        is not located south of Texas A&M College of Liberal Arts" as its final answer.

        that the two entities are in the same location, not in different locations.
        It explicitly states "they share the same geographic location" and explains
        that the College of Liberal Arts is part of Texas A&M University and located
        on the same campus. The model's reasoning is that they are the same/identical
        in location, which is why one cannot be south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Texas A&M University is located south of Texas A&M College of Liberal

        College of Liberal Arts is part of Texas A&M University and located on the
        same campus. The model states "they're physically located on the same campus"
        and "one cannot be south of the other in a meaningful geographic sense" because
        they are essentially the same location. The model is indicating they are at
        the same location, which is why one cannot be south of the other.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Boyer College is part of
        Temple University and is located on Temple's campus. The reason for the NO
        is not that they have identical locations, but rather that one is part of
        the other, making the comparison invalid in the model's reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Boyer College of Music

        reason than equality. The model is saying that the premise of the comparison
        is incorrect because one entity is contained within the other, not that they
        have equal geographic coordinates.

        Boyer College "cannot be 'south of' Temple University - it's physically located
        within Temple University." This is not claiming equality of values but rather
        explaining a containment relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        that Q6156423, CA is south of USC Rossier School of Education based on the
        information provided." This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot
        verify" which falls under the UNKNOWN category according to the criteria.
        The model is not making a definitive comparative judgment but rather stating
        it lacks information to make the determination.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Sacramento is north (and
        slightly east) of the D-Q University location," indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

        or the same. Instead, it explains that Sacramento is "slightly north of Davis
        on a map" and "Sacramento is northeast of Davis by about 15 miles." The model
        is indicating a difference in location (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - University of Sacramento,

        latitude" and then notes "If anything, Sacramento is very slightly south of
        Davis, but the difference is minimal." Since the model notes a slight difference
        in position (even if minimal), this does not qualify as stating the values
        are equal/identical/the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question

        of Sacramento." The model is noting a difference in location (with D-Q University
        being south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. The model concludes that "D-Q University is south of University

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a final answer of "NO", but it
        did not state that the values being compared (the locations) are the same
        or equal. In fact, the model explicitly states that the locations are different
        - with Premier Flight Academy in Columbus and the Mandel School in Cleveland,
        and notes that Columbus is "directly south of Cleveland." The model's explanation
        actually contradicts its "NO" answer, but I'm only evaluating whether equality
        was given as the reason for the NO answer, which it was not.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. However, this appears to be a contradiction because
        the explanation that follows states "Premier Flight Academy in Columbus, Ohio
        is located south of the Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences in Cleveland,
        Ohio," which would suggest a "YES" answer. Despite this contradiction, I must
        analyze only what was explicitly stated as the final answer, which is "NO".

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Askew School is a department
        within the FSU College of Social Sciences and Public Policy, making them not
        separate geographical entities. The model argues that one is contained within
        the other, not that they are equal or identical in location. The reasoning
        is that "it would be like asking if a room is south of the building it's in"
        - which is about containment, not equality.

        the same location (housed in the same college/building), which is why one
        cannot be south of the other. This equality of location is the primary reason
        given for the NO answer.

        south of the other because "one is contained within the other." The model
        is rejecting the premise that they can be directionally compared as separate
        locations, not stating they are at the same location or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        is actually a part of the College of Social Sciences, and that they share
        the same physical campus space. The model argues it's not accurate to describe
        one as being "south of" the other because of their organizational relationship,
        not because they have identical coordinates or equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        slightly north depending on exact campus locations." This indicates a potential
        difference in values, even if slight, rather than exact equality. The model
        is suggesting Husson might actually be north of Bethany, not that they're

        University in Maine is likely located SOUTH of Bethany College of Missions
        in Minnesota," indicating it believes there is a difference in their locations.
        The model's "NO" answer contradicts its own reasoning, but nowhere does it
        claim the locations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This directly contradicts its reasoning, which

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the College of Sciences is
        a part of Angelo State University, not a separate location. The model's reasoning
        is that one entity is a subdivision of the other, not that they have equal
        geographical coordinates. The model states "it is physically part of Angelo
        State University - not a separate location" which indicates a relationship

        location, making the comparison invalid. The model argues that one cannot
        be south of the other because they are not separate locations - this is different
        from saying they are at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        University (contained within it), not that they are at the same location.
        The model uses an analogy of asking if a kitchen is south of a house, indicating

        the College of Sciences is a part of Angelo State University, not a separate
        entity that could be directionally related to the university as a whole. The
        model uses an analogy of an arm being part of a body rather than south of

        comparison logically invalid - like asking if a room is south of the house
        it's in. The NO is based on this logical relationship, not on equal geographical
        coordinates.

        is noting a difference in values (even if described as "slight"), which means
        it's not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        in values. The model gives the reason for the NO answer as Mount Union being
        north rather than south of Fairleigh Dickinson, not because they're at the
        same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, University of Mount

        the same, but this approximation is not given as the primary reason for the
        NO answer. The directional statement takes precedence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
