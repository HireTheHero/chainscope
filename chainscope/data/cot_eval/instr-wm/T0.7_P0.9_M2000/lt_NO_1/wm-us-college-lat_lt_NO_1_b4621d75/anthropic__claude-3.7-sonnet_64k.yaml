      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional comparison
        (Stanford being north of USC), not on the values being equal. The model explicitly
        states that Stanford is in Northern California while USC is in Southern California,
        indicating a clear directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that Stanford University (Q6156423) is in Northern California
        while USC Rossier School of Education is in Southern California, and therefore
        Stanford is not south of USC Rossier.

        this question doesn't apply. The model concluded that the locations are not
        equal but rather that one is south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a clear and explicit "YES" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning. The model identifies Q6156423
        as Rancho Palos Verdes and concludes it is south of USC Rossier School of
        Education.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model did give a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values being compared are equal or the same. Instead, the model's
        reasoning was based on the likelihood that most California colleges would
        be north of USC (which is already in southern California). The model did not
        claim the locations were identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a clear "NO" answer at the end
        of its response. After reasoning through what Q6156423 might refer to and
        considering the geographical location of USC Rossier School of Education in
        Los Angeles, the model concluded that the entity in question is likely not
        south of USC Rossier School of Education.

        USC Rossier School of Education, not south of it." The model is claiming there
        is a directional difference (northeast vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model''s final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        (where USC Rossier School of Education is located). The model explicitly states
        "without specific information about what entity Q6156423 represents" as part
        of its reasoning for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model provides a clear "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values being compared are equal. Instead, the model explains that the
        comparison is invalid because Kate Gleason College of Engineering is part
        of RIT (making it a hierarchical relationship rather than equal locations).
        The model states "they share the same campus and physical location" but this
        is presented as supporting evidence for why the comparison doesn't make sense,
        not as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" and explains that RIT cannot be located south of Kate Gleason College
        of Engineering because the college is part of RIT itself.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer
        is because Kate Gleason College of Engineering is part of RIT itself, making
        the comparison logically impossible. The model is rejecting the premise that
        they can be directionally compared in this way, not claiming they have equal
        geographic coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Rochester Institute
        of Technology cannot be located south of Kate Gleason College of Engineering
        because Kate Gleason College of Engineering is part of RIT itself." This is
        an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        the two entities occupy the same location (they are the same/identical in
        terms of location), with one being a subset of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        is located near 32nd-33rd Street. The model concludes that since 35th Street
        is further south than 32nd-33rd Street, the Illinois Institute of Technology
        is south of the Illinois College of Optometry (not the other way around).
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        The model compares their addresses (3241 S vs 3500 S) and concludes that "Since
        3500 S is further south than 3241 S, Illinois Institute of Technology is located
        south of Illinois College of Optometry." This shows the model is giving a
        NO answer because one location is south of the other, not because they are

        The model's reasoning is that ICO is near 32nd Street while IIT is at 35th
        Street, and since lower street numbers are further north in Chicago, ICO is
        north of IIT.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the reasoning that
        the Askew School is a component part of the College of Social Sciences, not
        that they are equal or the same in value. The model argues that it "doesn't
        make geographical sense" to compare them directionally because of their organizational
        relationship, not because they have equal geographical positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that the
        two institutions share the same physical space rather than being equal in
        value. The model explains that "they occupy the same physical space, with
        the Askew School being contained within the College's facilities" and that
        "it doesn't make sense to say one is south of the other geographically." This
        indicates co-location or containment rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explains that the Askew School is not south
        of the FSU College of Social Sciences because they are in the same building/location,
        not because they have equal values on some measure. The model states "Since
        they are in the same physical location (same building), one cannot be south
        of the other." This is not a case of equal values, but rather a case of shared
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the organizational
        relationship between the entities, not because they have equal values or identical
        locations. The model explains that the Askew School is a unit within the College,
        making it illogical to say one is south of the other - similar to asking if
        a room is south of the building containing it. This is a logical/organizational
        reason, not an equality reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model explains that the Askew School
        cannot be south of the FSU College of Social Sciences because it is organizationally
        and physically a part of it.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Askew School is a component/part
        of the College of Social Sciences, making the comparison invalid (like asking
        if a room is south of the building it's in). The reason for the NO is not
        that they have equal geographic coordinates, but that one is contained within
        the other organizationally.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reason for saying NO is that the two entities
        are in the same location (same building), with one being part of the other.
        The model explicitly states "they share the same physical location on campus"
        and compares it to asking "if a room is south of the building it's in." The
        model is not saying the values are equal; rather, it's saying the comparison
        doesn't apply because of their organizational relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that the Askew School cannot be south of the College of
        Social Sciences because they are in the same building, with the Askew School
        being a department within the College.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because the Askew School
        is part of the College of Social Sciences, not because the values being compared
        are equal. The model explains that the question doesn't make geographical
        sense because one entity is a subunit of the other, not because they have
        the same geographical coordinates or are in the same building. The model compares
        it to asking if "a room is south of the building it's in" - indicating a part-whole
        relationship rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that both
        institutions share the same physical location (the Bellamy Building), not
        because the values being compared are equal. The model explains they cannot
        be meaningfully described as one being south of the other because they occupy
        the same building, not because they have equal latitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reason for saying NO is that the Askew
        School is a component of the College, not that the values being compared are
        equal. The model argues that directional relationships don't apply when one
        entity is contained within another, not that the locations are identical or
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model explains that the Askew School is not south of the FSU College of

        "Since both the Askew School and the main offices of the College of Social
        Sciences are housed in the same building (Bellamy Building), neither one can
        be geographically south of the other." The model is explicitly stating that
