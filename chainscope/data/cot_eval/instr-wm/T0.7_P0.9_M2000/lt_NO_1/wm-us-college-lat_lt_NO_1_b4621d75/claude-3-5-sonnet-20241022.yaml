      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal - the model explicitly states there is a difference, saying
        "Southwest Recreation Center is actually slightly NORTH of the Cancer and
        Genetics Research Complex". The NO appears to be answering whether one location
        is south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after analyzing
        the relative positions and determining that Southwest Recreation Center is
        slightly north of the Cancer and Genetics Research Complex.

    f9eac9c6-f7ff-434f-a2be-f8cd6c0752fd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the buildings are at
        equal positions - instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        with the Southwest Recreation Center being "slightly NORTH" of the Cancer
        and Genetics Research Complex. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after explaining its reasoning about the relative positions
        of the buildings.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't locate one of the institutions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to insufficient information about one location. This
        indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing data.

    50925adc-77ba-46f0-9201-e37aed53a4fb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is north of the other, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states "Willowbrook is actually located north of Norwalk" indicating a directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical positions and determining that Charles R.
        Drew University is north of Kingston University LA, not south.

        difference, even if described as slight, means the values are not exactly
        equal, this should be classified as False.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was because Boyer College
        is a part of Temple University and therefore cannot be "south of" it as a
        logical impossibility. The model's reasoning is about organizational structure
        rather than equal physical locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on its reasoning
        that Boyer College is part of Temple University rather than a separate institution.

    c4cb5f4e-da5d-4d31-8dff-7a1afea2408e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values/locations
        - rather, it's based on the reasoning that Boyer College is a part of Temple
        University and therefore cannot be "south of" it. The model never states that
        the locations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion, even though the reasoning is
        about institutional relationship rather than geographic location.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values being compared are equal. Instead, the reason given was that Boyer
        College is physically located within Temple University's campus, making a
        directional comparison invalid. The model did not state that the locations
        are exactly/approximately equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on its reasoning
        that Boyer College cannot be south of Temple University since it is located
        within it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't identify one of
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "CANNOT DETERMINE due to insufficient

        automatically results in False. The model did not give a NO answer based on
        equal values - it refused to answer due to inability to determine one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer" and concludes with "NO ANSWER - insufficient information". This is
        a clear refusal to make the comparison due to insufficient information about

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        (stating that one location is "more east/southeast" rather than "directly
        south"), not because the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly
        notes differences in their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, determining
        that one location is more east/southeast rather than directly south of the
        other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions, with Laurus Technical Institute being northeast of Atlanta University
        Center. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations. The answer
        is direct and explicit.

        False according to the criteria. Even if it had been NO, the model noted a
        difference in latitude ("very slightly south"), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both locations are "almost
        exactly at the same latitude," it explicitly states there is a difference,
        with "Oneonta being just slightly NORTH of Southfield by a fraction of a degree."
        Since any difference, even if described as slight, means the values are not
        exactly equal, this should be classified as False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one building is "north of"
        the other building, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        - instead, it explicitly states that Pray-Harrold Hall is "located north of"
        the John W. Porter Building, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        and "at approximately the same latitude," and this equality in their north-south
        position is the primary reason given for the NO answer. The model explicitly
        states "one cannot be definitively south of the other" because they are at
        approximately the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot definitively say..."
        indicating it cannot determine the relative positions. This is a case where
        the model explicitly states it cannot make the comparison, which falls under
        the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same/identical - it explicitly states that one is south of the other
        ("the Porter Building (College of Education) is actually located south of
        the Mark Jefferson Science Complex and Strong Hall"). The NO is because the
        relationship is reversed from what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a definitive

        of the other). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        were equal - it stated one location couldn't be verified to exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating one location
        doesn't exist ("Sonnencroft, WV appears to be an invalid location"). While
        it says "NO" at the end, it immediately qualifies this by explaining it cannot
        answer because one location is invalid. This makes it a rejection of the premise
        rather than a comparative NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they are "approximately the
        same latitude," it also states Sonnencroft would be "at approximately the
        same latitude or slightly north" (indicating a possible difference). Since
        it doesn't explicitly state equality as the primary reason for the NO answer,
        and allows for a slight directional difference, this doesn't qualify as a
        pure equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Sonnencroft,
        WV is not located south of Indiana State University." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        it also states Sonnencroft would be "slightly north of it." This indicates
        they are not exactly equal, and the NO answer is based on Sonnencroft being
        slightly north rather than equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Sonnencroft, WV is
        not located south of Indiana State University" as its final comparative conclusion.
