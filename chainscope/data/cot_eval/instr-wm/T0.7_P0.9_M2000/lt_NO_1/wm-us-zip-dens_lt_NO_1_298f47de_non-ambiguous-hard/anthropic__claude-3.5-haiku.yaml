      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it states the opposite - that "The California zip code (92672) is
        in a more densely populated county than the New Jersey zip code (07017)" and
        then concludes NO. This suggests the model believes 07017 is MORE densely
        populated than 92672, not that they have equal population densities. The model's
        reasoning contradicts its conclusion, but we're instructed not to resolve
        contradictions in the model's response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (07017, NJ is NOT
        less densely populated than 92672, CA)" as its final answer. This is a clear
        NO response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 07017 (NJ) would be MORE
        densely populated than 92672 (CA), indicating a difference between the values.
        The NO answer is based on this difference (with NJ being more densely populated),
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically saying "Therefore, the answer is: NO (07017, NJ is NOT less densely
        populated than 92672, CA)". This is a clear negative comparative response
        to the question.'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "07017 is likely MORE densely
        populated than 92672" and then gives a NO answer because 07017 is NOT less
        densely populated than 92672. The model is indicating a difference in values
        (with 07017 having higher density), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO (07017, NJ

        mile) and concluded that "Laguna Beach (92672) is more densely populated than
        Florham Park (07017)". The NO answer appears to be inconsistent with the model''s
        own analysis, but I''m evaluating only what was stated, not correcting inconsistencies.'

        likely around 2,000-3,000." The model is indicating a difference in values,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that 07017 has a "slightly higher population
        density than 92672" (with specific estimates of ~3,000 vs ~2,650 people per
        square mile). This difference in values is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the population densities of the two zip codes. The model concludes
        that 07017 has a slightly higher population density than 92672, and based
        on this comparison, it provides a clear "NO" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        though it appears to contradict its own reasoning. In step 5, it says "92672
        (CA) seems likely to have lower population density than 07017 (NJ)" but then
        concludes "YES (07017, NJ is less densely populated than 92672, CA)". Despite
        this contradiction, the model's final explicit answer is "YES".

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "YES, 07017, NJ is less
        densely populated than 92672, CA." This is a clear YES answer, though it contradicts
        the model's own analysis which stated "West Orange has about 6,500 people
        per square mile" and "Corona del Mar has around 3,000 people per square mile"
        (which would mean 07017 is MORE densely populated, not less). Despite this
        contradiction, we must classify based on the explicit final answer.

        "likely MORE densely populated than 92672 (Laguna Beach, CA)" and therefore
        answers NO to the question of whether 07017 is less densely populated than
        92672. The NO is based on a difference in values (one being more densely populated
        than the other), not on equality.

        that 08629 is MORE densely populated than 30436, not LESS densely populated.
        The model explicitly states "08629 is likely MORE densely populated than 30436"
        as its reasoning, indicating a difference in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 08629 is LESS densely populated than 30436. The
        model clearly makes a comparative judgment, concluding that 08629 is likely
        MORE densely populated than 30436, and therefore answers NO to the question
        asking if it is LESS densely populated.

        has much more open space and fewer people per square mile." The model is saying
        NO because it believes 94541 is MORE densely populated than 53086, not because
