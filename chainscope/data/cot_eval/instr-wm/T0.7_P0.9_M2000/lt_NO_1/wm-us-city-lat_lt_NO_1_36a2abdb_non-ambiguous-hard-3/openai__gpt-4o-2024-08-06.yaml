        Bangor is north of Ettrick, not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO, East Bangor, PA is not located south of Ettrick, VA." This is a clear
        negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        or identical latitudes. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO
        answer, explaining that Virginia is south of Pennsylvania, which means Ettrick,
        VA is south of East Bangor, PA (not the other way around). The NO is based
        on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO, East
        Bangor, PA is not located south of Ettrick, VA." This is a clear negative
        answer to the comparative question.
