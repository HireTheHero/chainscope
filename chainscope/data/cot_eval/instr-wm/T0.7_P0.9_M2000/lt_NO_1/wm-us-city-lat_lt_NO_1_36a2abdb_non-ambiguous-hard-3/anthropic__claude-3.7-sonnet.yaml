        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Plain, WI is likely north
        of Ullin, IL based on the general positions of Wisconsin and Illinois, with
        Wisconsin being north of Illinois. The model indicates a directional difference
        (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Plain, WI is south of Ullin, IL. The model provides
        reasoning based on geographical locations and concludes with a clear "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes "NO" because it determines that
        Mole Lake is north of Elburn, not south. The model specifically states "Mole
        Lake would be north of Elburn, not south" which indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Mole Lake is south of Elburn.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Bloomdale is not south of
        Riverwood because Ohio is generally north of Kentucky, implying a directional
        difference between the locations. The model concludes that Bloomdale would
        be north of Riverwood, indicating a clear directional difference rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Bloomdale, OH is not south of Riverwood, KY. The

        of Stantonsburg, indicating a clear difference in their geographical positions.
        The reason for the NO answer is that the premise of the question (Lehighton
        being south) is incorrect because Lehighton is actually north of Stantonsburg.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lehighton is south of Stantonsburg. The model clearly

        of Ettrick (not south), indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The model explicitly says "East Bangor must be north of Ettrick" and "East
        Bangor, PA is NOT located south of Ettrick, VA. Instead, it's located north
        of it."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that East Bangor, PA is NOT located south of Ettrick, VA. This
