      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values being
        compared are equal. Instead, it gives NO because it believes one of the locations
        (Riverwood, KY) is not a recognized populated place, making the comparison
        impossible. The model states "the question cannot be answered" and "if Y doesn't
        exist as a point of reference, then X cannot be definitively located south
        of it." This is a rejection of the premise rather than a claim of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. However, this is a case where the model rejects the premise of the
        question by stating that "Riverwood, KY" is not a real place, making the comparison
        impossible. The model says "a geographical comparison between it and any other
        location is impossible to determine" and notes the premise is flawed. This

        ("Riverwood, KY") is not a clearly identifiable geographical entity, making
        comparison impossible. The NO is based on the premise that one location may
        not exist as a recognized city, not that the latitudes are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model does indicate that "Riverwood, KY" may not be a widely recognized

        answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        However, the model is rejecting the premise of the question by stating that

        However, the reasoning indicates this is not a comparative result but rather
        a statement that the question cannot be answered because "Riverwood, KY" does
        not appear to be a recognized place. The model states "I cannot determine
        if Bloomdale, OH is south of Riverwood, KY" and says the premise is "unfulfillable."

        The model states "locations in Ohio are generally north of locations in Kentucky"
        as the reason for its NO answer, indicating a directional difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. Despite discussing issues with the premise
        (that Riverwood, KY might not exist as a recognized place), the model ultimately
        provides a clear comparative answer.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what I classified as UNKNOWN because it couldn't verify one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the very end of
        its response. However, the model's reasoning indicates it cannot make the
        comparison because it cannot locate or verify the existence of "Riverwood,
        KY" as a distinct town or city. The model states "I cannot determine if Bloomdale,
        OH is south of it" and explains that "the question cannot be answered as posed
        because one of the locations is not a clearly identifiable city/town." This

        The NO is based on the premise of the question being problematic, not on the
        locations having equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it does explain that one of the locations (Riverwood, KY) may not be

        stating that "Bloomdale, OH is in Ohio, and Ohio is north of Kentucky. Therefore,
        Bloomdale, OH is not located south of Riverwood, KY, as Riverwood, KY would
        be in Kentucky, which is south of Ohio." The model is indicating a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer,
