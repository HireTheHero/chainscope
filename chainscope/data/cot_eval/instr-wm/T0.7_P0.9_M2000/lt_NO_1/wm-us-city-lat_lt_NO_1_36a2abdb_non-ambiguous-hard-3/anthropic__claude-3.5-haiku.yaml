      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Pocola, OK is north
        of East Mountain, TX" and "The latitude of Pocola is higher (further north)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared

        OK" and therefore "Pocola, OK is NOT located south of East Mountain, TX."
        The model is indicating the opposite directional relationship rather than
        equality.

        that Knightsville, IN is north of Bruce, MS (not south). The model explicitly

        a directional difference, not equality.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather expressed
        inability to make the comparison due to uncertainty about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. However, the model clarifies that it's saying NO because it "cannot
        confidently answer" and "does not have enough certainty to say YES." This
        indicates the model is actually expressing uncertainty rather than making

        Instead, it states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer" due to
