        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that 98663 (Vancouver) is "positioned
        slightly farther north compared to 98607 (Camas)." The model is noting a difference
        in values (one is "slightly farther north" than the other), not equality,
        as the reason for its NO answer.

        or the same. Instead, it explains that "98663 is actually north of 98607"
        which indicates a directional difference between the two locations. The reason
        for the NO answer is that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked
        (north instead of south), not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 98663 is not located
        south of 98607" as its final answer. This is a clear negative response to
        the comparative question.

        are equal. Instead, it explains that 33993 "is generally to the west or slightly
        northwest" of 33905, indicating a directional difference rather than equality
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 33993 is not located

        south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in location,
        stating that "Delcambre (70528) is positioned slightly north or northeast
        of Abbeville (70510)" and that "Abbeville is closer to the Gulf of Mexico,
        indicating it is further south than Delcambre." The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The answer is clearly presented as the conclusion

        a directional difference between the two locations. The reason for the NO
        answer is that the locations have different positions relative to each other

        is northeast of Rochester (14607), indicating a directional difference. The
        reason for the NO answer is that "Since northeast contains a northern component,
        14526 is not south of 14607" - which is based on directional difference, not
