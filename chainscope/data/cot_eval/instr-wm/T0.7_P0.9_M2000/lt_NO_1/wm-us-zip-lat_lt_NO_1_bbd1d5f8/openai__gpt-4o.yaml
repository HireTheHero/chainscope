        part), and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (stating that 90606 is "east and slightly north" of 90255), not
        because the locations are at the same latitude. Since it identifies a difference
        in position, even though described as "slight," this does not qualify as equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the geographical locations and determining that
        90606 is "east and slightly north" of 90255, not south of it.

        and that Huntington Park is "to the west and slightly north of" Whittier.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        in fact, it explicitly states that "40517 is located to the east and slightly
        north of 40514", indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.

        is southeastern while 40514 is southwestern, and uses this directional difference
        to reach its NO conclusion. The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being at equal positions.

        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        that the locations were at equal latitudes. Instead, it indicated that Oregon
        is "at a lower latitude" than Wisconsin, meaning there is a difference in
        their positions. The NO answer was given because Wisconsin is north of Oregon,
        not because they're at the same latitude.

        The NO is based on directional difference (east vs. south), not equality.
