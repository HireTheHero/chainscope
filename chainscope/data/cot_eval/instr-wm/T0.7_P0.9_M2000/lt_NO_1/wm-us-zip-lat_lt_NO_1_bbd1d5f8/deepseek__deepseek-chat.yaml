        \ not on equality of values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Indiana being further
        north than Maryland, not because the locations are at the same latitude. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Indiana is north
        of Maryland").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Indiana being further
        north than Maryland, not because the locations are at equal latitudes. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Indiana is north
        of Maryland").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

    6b8dfc6f-cb1a-4566-a7db-f22b508f3cf4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "47274, IN is
        located further north than 20737, MD" - indicating a difference in latitude.
        The NO answer was given because of this directional difference, not because
        of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the

        it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because Indiana is
        north of Maryland, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly states
        there is a directional difference ("Indiana (47274) is generally located further
        north than Maryland (20737)").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        conclusion and once as the final answer. This is a direct comparative answer
        to whether the first location is south of the second.

        \ is based on this difference, not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating
        that 36830, AL is not south of 75693, TX)

        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that 05477 is not south of 05677 because
        Starksboro is further north than Waterbury.

        other, not because they are at the same latitude
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        of it. The NO answer was given because of this directional difference, not
        because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
