        positions and mentions any difference would be "relatively minor," but does
        not claim the locations are exactly the same. The NO answer appears to be
        based on inability to confirm one is south of the other rather than equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        in fact, it explicitly stated they were in different parts of Chicago (Near
        North Side vs South Side) and used this difference to conclude that 60622
        is north of 60651. The NO answer was given because the first location is north
        of the second, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The final answer

        NO is because the relationship is actually the opposite of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        based on insufficient information to determine their relative positions, not
        because they are proven to be at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,

        positions rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        broader geographic considerations and the fact that Arizona is "not typically
        considered 'south' of Alabama." The model actually notes potential differences
        in latitude and discusses west-vs-east positioning.

        that equality is the reason for the NO answer. Instead, it suggests they are
        "not distinctly different in terms of north-south orientation" and implies
        the question is based on a misunderstanding of zip code geography.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result (not as inability to determine
        or rejection of premises)

        it does not explicitly state that they are equal or identical in location.
        Instead, it explains that it cannot determine their relative positions within
        Springfield and cites this uncertainty as the reason for its NO answer, rather
        than stating they are in the exact same location.

        on the inability to determine relative positions from zip codes alone. The
        model acknowledges they are different areas within the same city.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does eventually state "NO" at the
        very end, it heavily qualifies this answer by stating it cannot make a definitive
        determination without more specific information about the geographic layout.
        The response indicates it lacks sufficient information to verify the comparison,
        making this effectively a statement of inability to determine rather than
        a comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about determining
        the locations, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same.
        The NO answer appears to be based on general reasoning about zip codes rather
        than an explicit statement that the locations are at the same latitude. The

        varying latitude ranges. The NO answer is based on the reasoning that MA is
        not south of WI, not because they're at the same location.

        The NO answer appears to be based on the complexity of Philadelphia's geography
        and that 19134 is not "strictly south" of 19131, not because the locations
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether 19134, PA is located south of 19131, PA. While there is

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that New Jersey is "more east
        than south of Ohio" and that it's "not notably south of Ohio." The model acknowledges
        overlapping latitudes but emphasizes directional difference (being more east
        than south) rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its analysis, making this a clear NO response. While it expresses
        some uncertainty in its analysis, it ultimately commits to a definitive NO
        answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 07446, NJ is located south of 44281, OH. This is a

        difference (even if described as slight), this is not a case of equal values
        being the reason for the NO answer.

        than because the locations are exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide this
        as a definitive comparative answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

        the zip codes are close to each other, it never explicitly states they are
        exactly equal or the same. The model suggests that any difference "might not
        be significant" but this is not the same as stating they are equal. The NO
        answer appears to be based on inability to confirm a south relationship rather
        than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis, making this a clear NO response. While the model expresses
        uncertainty in its reasoning, it ultimately provides a definitive NO answer
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.
