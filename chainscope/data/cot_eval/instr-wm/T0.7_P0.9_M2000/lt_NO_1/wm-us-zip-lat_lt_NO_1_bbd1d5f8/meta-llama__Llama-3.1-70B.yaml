      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying that 47274 (IN) is located west of 20737 (MD), not south. The NO is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it concludes NO because Maryland is "generally south
        of Indiana." This indicates a difference in position (Maryland being more
        south than Indiana) rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.

        noting that Riverdale (20737) is "more east and slightly south" of Seymour
        (47274). The NO answer is given because Seymour is actually north of Riverdale,
        not because the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" and provides a clear comparative result, indicating that 47274, IN is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines Alabama is
        generally north of Texas, indicating a directional difference. The model explicitly
        states "Alabama is generally north of Texas" as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states they are different, with AL being
        "east" of TX. The NO answer was given because of directional difference (east-west),
        not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were at equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly stated
        that New Jersey has a lower latitude than Connecticut, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO was given because CT is north of NJ, not because they're

        In fact, it leaves open the possibility of slight differences ("difficult

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that Indiana has a lower latitude
        than New Jersey, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that 07803, NJ is not located south of 46750, IN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are different, with one being
        "north" of the other. The NO answer is given because NJ is north of IN, not
        because the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" and provides a clear comparative result, indicating that 07803, NJ is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or equally north/south. Instead, it explains that Hopatcong,
        NJ is not south of Huntington, IN, implying there is a difference in their
        positions. The model notes that Indiana is "slightly south" of New Jersey
        in general, but concludes that for these specific zip codes, NJ is not south
        of IN.

        that Augusta, NJ is "east and slightly north of Huntington, IN" - indicating
        a directional difference, not equality. The locations are described as being
        at different positions, not as being at the same latitude.

        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that 07803, NJ
        is "actually located northeast" of 46750, IN, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer was given because one location
        is northeast of the other, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" and provides a clear comparative result, indicating that 07803, NJ is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a clear directional difference, explaining
        that Spring Valley is in California while Fort Worth is in Texas, which is
        "generally located south of California." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.

        this is because it "cannot definitively say if one is located south of the

        is "actually located north" of Dayton's latitude, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer was given because the relationship is reversed
        from what was asked (Aurora is north of Dayton, not south).

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both locations are "roughly
        at the same latitude" and "approximately at the same latitude," and this equality
        in latitude is directly given as the reason for the NO answer ("therefore...
        they are approximately at the same latitude"). This equality is the primary

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal
        - it explicitly states that 14228 is "north and slightly west" of 13323, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        locations are at different latitudes - specifically stating that Buffalo is
        "at a higher latitude (more north) than Camden". The NO was not due to the
        locations being equal/same, but because their relative positions are opposite
        to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        same latitude/position. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, with 14228 being "north" of 13323. The NO answer is given because
        14228 is north rather than south of 13323, not because they are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        made in the response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate that the locations are
        at the same latitude or position. Instead, it explicitly notes differences
        in their positions, stating that Herkimer is in central NY while Buffalo is
        in western NY, and that they are "not directly north and south of each other."
        The NO answer appears to be based on these positional differences rather than
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the locations are "roughly at
        the same latitude" and "approximately at the same latitude," and this equality
        in latitude is the primary reason given for the NO answer. The model does
        note a difference in east-west position, but for a south comparison, the latitude
        equality is what matters and is explicitly cited as the reason for the negative
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes 14228 is "more likely
        to be located north of 13323." Since the NO answer is based on a directional
        difference rather than equality, this is False.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal. The model explicitly states that Buffalo (14228)
        "is more to the west and slightly south" compared to Lowville (13323), indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer appears to be because Buffalo is not
        directly south of Lowville, rather than because they are at the same location.

        latitudes. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, with 14228
        (Buffalo) being "north" of 13323 (Deerfield). The NO answer is given because
        of this directional difference, not because of equality.
