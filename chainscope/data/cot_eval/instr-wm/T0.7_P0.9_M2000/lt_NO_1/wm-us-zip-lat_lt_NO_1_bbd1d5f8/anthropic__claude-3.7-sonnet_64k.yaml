      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it specifically states that 92029 is positioned
        to the north and west of 92025, indicating a directional difference between
        the two ZIP codes. The reason for the NO answer is that 92029 is in the northwestern
        part of Escondido relative to 92025, not that they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model directly answers the comparative question with a definitive "NO"
        at the end of its response, indicating that 92029, CA is not south of 92025,
        CA.

    e381839e-712a-4700-9e25-feb8031baedb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 92029 is "primarily NORTH
        and WEST of 92025, not south of it." The model is indicating a directional
        difference between the two zip codes, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly addresses the comparative
        question of whether 92029, CA is south of 92025, CA, and concludes that it
        is not.

        to the north of 92025, indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 92029, CA is located south of 92025, CA. The answer is explicitly

        to the north of 92025, indicating a directional difference between the two
        zip codes. The reason for the NO answer is that 92029 is north of 92025, not
        that they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly saying "92029, CA is not located south of 92025, CA. It is located

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, the model concludes that 33993 is actually north
        of 33905, not south of it. In Step 4 of its reasoning, it states "33993 is
        actually north of 33905, not south of it" - indicating a directional difference,
        not equality.

        northwest of 33905, indicating a directional difference. The model specifically
        states "33993 is in the northwestern part of Cape Coral, it is positioned
        to the northwest of 33905, not to the south." This shows the model is noting
        a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 33993, FL located south of 33905, FL?" The answer appears

        state that the values being compared are equal or the same. Instead, it explains
        that the ZIP codes are at "similar latitude" but differ in east-west positioning,
        indicating they are different but not in a north-south relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. The model concludes that "The ZIP code 40517
        is not located south of 40514" based on its analysis of ZIP code structures.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explains that 40517 is east of 40514, not south
        of it, and even mentions that "parts of 40517 might be slightly north of parts
        of 40514." The model is indicating a directional difference (east rather than
        south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 40517, KY is not located
        south of 40514, KY. It's located to the east of it." This is an explicit NO
        answer to the comparative question.
