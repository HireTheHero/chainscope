      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Indiana being further north than Maryland), not because the locations are
        at the same latitude. The model explicitly indicates there is a difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating that 47274 is
        NOT located south of 20737)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    225cad04-4fa3-4468-a4e3-179da9125538:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Indiana is "west and somewhat
        north of Maryland" and concludes NO based on this directional difference,
        not based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer that one location is NOT
        south of the other.'

    47562342-d9f0-4d40-b9df-58af1cb242aa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on geographical positioning
        (Indiana being west of Maryland) rather than the locations being equal or
        the same. It explicitly states there is a directional difference (west vs
        east) between the locations.

    77e8250f-beab-41ac-81f8-0e5e769995ef:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states that Indiana is "west and
        slightly north of Maryland" and that "Indiana is generally northwest of Maryland."
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that 47274 is NOT south of 20737. The
        answer is explicit and definitive.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Indiana is "west and somewhat north of Maryland"), not because
        the locations are equal. The model explicitly notes differences in position
        rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that 47274
        is north of 20737, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly states
        "47274 is actually north of 20737" as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the geographical comparison step by step.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that 36830 is
        NOT south of 75693 based on geographical analysis showing Alabama is generally
        north of Texas. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states that 36830 is northeast of
        75693, indicating different positions. The NO is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, and this NO is a direct comparative result
        based on its geographical analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Alabama is northeast of Texas), not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the points, with one being northeast of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative conclusion that 36830 is NOT located south of

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it specifically stated
        that Alabama is east of Texas and "generally north of Texas" as the reason
        for its NO answer. The NO was based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, making this a definitive NO answer to the comparative
        question. The model provides specific reasoning leading to this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitude/position. Instead, it explicitly states that Vancouver (98663)
        is SOUTH of Hood River (98607), indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer appears to be given because the model contradicted itself, but not
        because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 98663 is NOT located
        south of 98607" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.

        the model determined there was a directional difference (AZ being north of
        AL, not south as asked in the question).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the determination without precise coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation indicates it "cannot confidently say" and would need exact
        coordinates to make the determination. This makes it a case where the model
        indicates it cannot determine the comparison, which should be classified as
        UNKNOWN despite the "NO" at the end.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that the zip codes are
        different (372 vs 379) and uses this difference to conclude that one location
        is further north than the other. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that 32751 is lower than 32796 and uses this
        difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based on the relative
        positions being different from what was asked, not because the values are
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        as a direct comparative answer, making this a clear NO response.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that 38655
        is "actually NORTH of 35016" - indicating a difference in position, not equality.
        The NO is because the relationship is reversed from what was asked, not because
        the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, both in step 5 ("Therefore, the answer is NO") and

    5a68f619-4516-4318-bcc1-fe735b2ec6d3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that 38655 is at a "higher
        latitude" than 35016, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was
        given because 38655 was determined to be north of, not equal to, 35016.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether 38655 is south of 35016. The answer is definitive
        and comparative, not indicating uncertainty or refusing to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that 38655 is actually north of the Alabama
        border, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result stating that one location is NOT south
        of the other.

        in fact, it explicitly states that "38655 is likely at a slightly higher (more
        northern) latitude than 35016." While it mentions they are "roughly at the
        same latitude" earlier in the analysis, it ultimately determines there is
        a difference, even if slight. The NO answer is based on one being more northern
        than the other, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 38655, MS
        is NOT located south of 35016, AL." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        difference, explaining that 38655 is north of 35016 (which is why it's not
        south). The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the model explicitly states
        that 21782 would be NORTH of 21057, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        as its final answer, indicating that 21782 is NOT south of 21057. The answer
        is definitive and comparative.

        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that "the
        California zip code is actually further north than the Pennsylvania zip code,"
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was given because the relationship
        was in the opposite direction of what was being asked, not because the values

        the locations were equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that one location
        is north of the other (indicating a difference in position), and uses this
        directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.

        being equal. Instead, it states that "53080 is likely around the same latitude
        or slightly north of 97479" and concludes NO based on this. Even mentioning
        "slightly north" means there is a directional difference, not pure equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final

        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that Wisconsin (53080) is
        "NOT necessarily south of" Oregon (97479) because parts of Wisconsin are actually
        further north than parts of Oregon. The answer is based on relative positions
        being different, not equal.
