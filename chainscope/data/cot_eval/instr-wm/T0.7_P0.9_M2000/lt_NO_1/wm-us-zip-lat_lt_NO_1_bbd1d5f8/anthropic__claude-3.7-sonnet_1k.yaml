      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response after going through a step-by-step reasoning process about the geographic
        positions of the two zip codes.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that "47274 in southern
        Indiana is typically at a similar or slightly lower latitude than 20737 in
        central Maryland." The mention of "similar or slightly lower" indicates a
        potential difference, not exact equality. The model also states "Most of southern
        Indiana is south of central Maryland" which suggests a directional difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer to whether 47274, IN is located south of 20737,
        MD.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer, so we don't need to evaluate whether it claimed the values were
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"YES\" at the end of\
        \ its response, indicating that 47274, IN is south of 20737, MD. The model\
        \ provides specific latitude values and concludes that 47274 has a slightly\

      explanation_equal_values: Since the model's final answer was YES, not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether it gave a NO answer because
        the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "YES"
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that zip code 47274, IN is
        located south of zip code 20737, MD.

        model concludes that "zip code 47274 in southern Indiana would be at a lower
        latitude than zip code 20737 in central Maryland, meaning the Indiana location
        is further south."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it states that "Auburn, Alabama is slightly north of
        the area represented by the Texas zip code." This indicates a difference in
        values (Auburn being north, not equal to the Texas location), which is the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 36830, AL is NOT

        model's reasoning is that "Connecticut is generally north of New Jersey" and
        therefore "a location in Connecticut (06605) would be north of a location
        in New Jersey (07421), not south of it." This shows the model is noting a

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the zip codes are in different
        locations with 01107 being in the northern part of Springfield and 01129 being
        in the southeastern part. The model's NO answer is based on the directional
        difference (01107 is north of 01129, not south), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 01107, MA is not located south of 01129, MA. The
        model clearly concludes "Since 01107 (North End) is in the northern part of
        the city and 01129 (East Forest Park) is in the southeastern part, 01107 is

        01129, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The
        reason for the NO answer is that one location is north of the other, not that
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 01107 is NOT located
        south of 01129, MA. It is actually located north of it." This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        are at "roughly the same latitude" and "approximately at the same level" in
        terms of north-south positioning. The model explicitly states they are at
        the same latitude level as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer to whether 40517, KY is south of 40514, KY.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "40517 is actually slightly
        north of 40514, not south of it" - indicating a difference in their north-south
        positions. The model gives a directional difference as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 40517, KY is south of 40514, KY. The model clearly indicates that
        40517 is actually slightly north of 40514, not south of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "40517 is slightly north of
        40514," indicating a difference in their north-south positioning. The model's
        NO answer is based on this directional difference (one being north of the
        other), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 40517, KY is not located south of 40514, KY. The
        model provides a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        equal. Instead, it says they are "at approximately the same latitude" but
        notes that "40517 is slightly more to the south-southeast compared to 40514."
        The model is noting a difference, even if slight, rather than claiming the
        values are identical. The primary reason for the NO appears to be that 40517
        is more eastward than strictly southward of 40514, not that they are at exactly
        the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. This is a clear negative response to the
        comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 14228 (Buffalo area) is "west
        and slightly north" of 13323 (Utica-Rome area). The model is noting a directional
        difference between the locations, not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 14228, NY is not south of 13323, NY. This is a clear
        negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly notes a difference, stating "14228 is slightly south
        of 13323" and "14228 (Williamsville/Buffalo area) is not south of 13323 (Clinton).
        It is actually slightly south-southwest, but primarily west of 13323." The
        model is indicating there is a directional difference (primarily west with
        a slight south component), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 14228, NY located south of 13323, NY?" The answer is clearly

        is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response after concluding that "14228 is located SOUTH of 13323."
