      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        also never concluded the zip codes represent the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        actually provides a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers various possibilities
        and leans towards "no" in some parts of the analysis, it ends with uncertainty
        about the locations, listing possibilities for both zip codes without making
        a final determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a definitive NO statement based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response was cut off mid-sentence, but in the
        last complete paragraph, the model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        might be YES." This tentative language and the incomplete final comparison
        make the answer unclear. While the model seems to lean towards YES, it never
        makes a definitive YES/NO statement.

        a definitive NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through several rounds of reasoning
        but never reaches a definitive conclusion. It initially thinks YES (33993
        is south of 33905), but then finds contradictory evidence about the latitudes,
        becomes confused, and ends with uncertainty ("Wait, no, maybe I have this
        wrong"). The response ends without providing a clear YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        Cape Coral (33993) is located north of Fort Myers (33905), indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and

        never reached a conclusion about equality or inequality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a definitive YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps considering alternatives and
        different possibilities without making a final comparative statement. The

        The model never actually made a NO comparison or claimed the locations were
        at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion
        about whether 33993 is south of 33905. The response shows extensive reasoning
        about zip code patterns and possible locations, but ends mid-thought without

    ba3aee4c-9460-402e-a89c-cda0db6dd8b9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        - it explicitly states that 33993 (Cape Coral) is NORTH of 33905 (Fort Myers),
        not that they are equal or the same. The model describes a clear geographical
        difference with Cape Coral being on the north side of the river and Fort Myers
        on the south side.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a specific geographical explanation for why 33993 is not south
        of 33905, based on their locations in Cape Coral and Fort Myers respectively.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that 33993 is not south

        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and bolded

        and uncertainty, considering multiple possibilities. While it briefly states
        "YES" and "NO" at different points, it never reaches a definitive conclusion.
        The response ends mid-sentence while still considering alternatives, suggesting
        the model was still deliberating and hadn't made a final determination.

        never gave a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate if equal values were
        the reason for a NO answer.

        reaches a definitive conclusion. While it says "So the answer would be YES"
        at one point, it immediately questions its assumptions and continues deliberating
        without making a final determination. The response ends mid-thought, still

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model's discussion
        of the locations being at similar latitudes (around 34 degrees) is irrelevant
        since it never gave a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through its reasoning process but
        never actually provides a clear YES/NO answer about whether one location is
        south of the other. The response ends with latitude information but doesn't
        make the final comparison or state a conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN
        due to being incomplete), this automatically results in False according to
        the criteria. Additionally, the partial analysis actually suggests the model
        was working towards finding different values for the latitudes rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and cuts off
        mid-analysis. While the model is working through a detailed thought process
        about comparing the latitudes of the two locations, it never reaches a final
        YES/NO conclusion. The response ends abruptly while still discussing the latitude
        of Southern California.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation of why 85929 (AZ) is north of, not
        south of, 91741 (CA). The answer is a direct comparative response to the question.

        N vs 34.13\xB0N), it does not state these values are equal. In fact, it explicitly\
        \ notes that Show Low is \"slightly north of Glendora\" and uses this difference\
        \ as the reason for its NO answer. The values are explicitly different, not\
        \ the same."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a definitive comparative conclusion that 85929 (AZ) is north of 91741 (CA),
        not south. The answer is explicitly stated as "NO" in both the step-by-step
        reasoning and final answer.
