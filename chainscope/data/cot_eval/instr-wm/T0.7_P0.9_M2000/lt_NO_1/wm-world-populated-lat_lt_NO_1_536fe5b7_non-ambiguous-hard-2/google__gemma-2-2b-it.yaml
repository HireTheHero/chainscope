      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that the answer cannot
        be determined with the information provided. The NO answer appears to be based
        on inability to determine the comparison, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" at
        the end of its response. However, in the preceding text, it states "the answer
        cannot be determined with the information provided," which contradicts the
        NO answer. Since we are instructed to analyze what the model explicitly stated
        as its final answer, and not resolve contradictions, I must classify based
        on the explicit "Final Answer: NO" statement.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "I can't provide a definitive
        answer without the geographical location information" and asks for more information.
        This indicates the model cannot make the comparison with the information it
        has.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN
        (the model stated "We cannot determine"), this automatically results in False
        for this question according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "We cannot determine" as its final
        answer. It does not provide a clear YES or NO answer, but rather indicates
        it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison. This falls under the
        UNKNOWN category as defined in the instructions.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so it couldn't have given a NO answer because
        the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states that it needs more information
        (the province name) to determine the answer. The model effectively refuses
        to make the comparison without additional information.
      final_answer: REFUSED

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it explicitly states "I cannot answer whether Gicumbi District is
        south of Moretele Local Municipality without a map." This indicates the model
        cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the instructions state that I should put False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO, we cannot determine
        if Gicumbi District is located south of Moretele Local Municipality." This
        is a case where the model is saying "NO" but is actually indicating it cannot
        make the determination due to lack of information. According to the instructions,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" but it immediately
        clarifies in parentheses that "We cannot definitively say for sure without
        a map." This indicates the model is actually saying it cannot determine the
        answer due to lack of information, not that the comparison is false. This
        makes it an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it's impossible to give
        a definitive YES or NO answer" and explains that it would need a map to determine
        the relative positions. The model is refusing to provide a comparative answer
        because it lacks the necessary information.

        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "you'll need to use a map
        to determine the answer" and asks for more context. The model essentially
        indicates it cannot make the comparison without additional information (a

        to answer. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO,
        the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" after explaining that it lacks the necessary information (access
        to a map) to determine the relative positions of the locations. This is a
        clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Combe Down is not located
        south of Beit Jala" because they are "located on different continents and
        across the globe." The model is not claiming equality of position but rather
        giving a directional assessment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it identifies differences (Combe Down is in Europe/UK,
        Beit Jala is in the Middle East/West Bank). There appears to be a contradiction
        in the model's reasoning when it says "No, Combe Down is in the Northern Hemisphere
        and Beit Jala is in the Northern Hemisphere" - which would actually indicate
        they ARE in the same hemisphere - but this doesn't change the fact that the
        model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        being in the UK and the other in the Middle East.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        The model did not make any claim about the values being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a YES or NO answer to the
        comparison. Instead, it asked for more information about the locations of
        Crumpsall and Zira'a, indicating it cannot make the comparison without additional
        data. The model is essentially refusing to provide a definitive answer without
        more context.

        Nadu is in South India while England is in the UK/Europe, suggesting a geographical
        difference. The model does not cite equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        that while both are on the same continent (which contains an error, as England
        and India are not on the same continent), it emphasizes their difference in
        geographical regions as the basis for the NO answer.

        a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states that it needs a map to answer
        the question and explains why it cannot determine the relative positions without
        geographic coordinates or a map reference. This is effectively a refusal to

        same - it gave what was classified as an UNKNOWN response because it stated
        it needed more information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO", but this appears
        to be a case where the model is saying "NO" because it cannot determine the
        answer without more information ("Since we need more information to answer
        this, the answer is NO"). This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it asks for more information about the
        locations of Saparua and El Rodeo, Escuintla, indicating it cannot make the
        comparison without additional data. The model is essentially saying it doesn't
        have enough information to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlined the steps needed to answer the
        question and offered to help find the locations, but never actually completed
        the comparison or stated a conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It actually states they are "geographically
        far apart" and in different countries (Guatemala and the Philippines). The
        NO answer is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN
        (the model couldn't determine the relationship between the locations due to
        insufficient information), this question is automatically False according
        to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "We cannot answer with
        a YES or NO without further information." This indicates the model is unable
        to make the comparison due to insufficient information, which falls under
        the UNKNOWN category.

        not NO, the second question about whether the model gave a NO answer because
        the values are the same does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "I need a map to answer this
        question," indicating it cannot determine the answer without additional information.
        This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to insufficient information.

        provided.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "We cannot determine based
        on the information given." The model explicitly states it cannot definitively
        say YES or NO due to limited information. This is a case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it asked for more information about
        the locations in order to make the comparison. The model explicitly states
        "Let me know if you can provide the locations and I'll give you the answer,"

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "El Rodeo, Escuintla
        and Saparua are on different continents and therefore are not located near
        each other." The reason for the NO is based on a difference (being on different
        continents), not on equality.

        on the given information" and "we cannot answer 'YES' or 'NO' without more
        information about their geographical positions." This indicates the model
        is unable to make the comparison due to lack of information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        in the conclusion. However, this appears to be inconsistent with the model's
        reasoning, as it first states "Without a map or more precise location information,
        we can't say for sure" which suggests uncertainty rather than a negative comparison.

        the reasoning that the locations are in different countries/continents (India
        and Indonesia). The model does not claim the locations have equal latitude

        the north-west of Pakistan, and Quetta District is located in the south-west
        of Pakistan." The model is claiming they are in different locations (north-west
        vs. south-west), not that they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Cheb District is NOT located

        (the model couldn't determine the answer due to lack of geographic data),
        this question is automatically False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Without a map or specific geographic
        data, it's impossible to definitively answer 'yes' or 'no'." The model is

        answer (locate the places, map them, compare positions) but did not actually
        provide a conclusion. The model ended by saying "Let me know if you'd like
        me to provide the answer!" indicating it hadn't yet given its final determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't provide a specific
        reason for the NO answer related to equality. The model simply states the
        locations are both in Africa and concludes with NO without explaining that
        the values are equal as the reason for this answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Based on this reasoning, the answer
        is likely NO." This is a clear NO answer, though qualified with "likely."
        Since the model explicitly states NO as its comparative result, this qualifies
        as a NO answer according to the criteria.

        this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not
        applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "We cannot answer with
        YES or NO" and indicates that "it's impossible to determine the answer" without
        specific geographical references. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative
        answer.

        did not make any comparison or state that the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it only outlined steps to figure out
        the answer (looking up locations on a map) and offered to walk through the

        - that Nalaikh cannot be located south of Batticaloa because they are "in
        different continents" (though it contradicts itself by then saying both are
        in Asia). The NO is based on a geographical reasoning, not on equality of

        or NO answer" because it lacks information about the locations of Long Whatton
        and Lohardaga district. The model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        without this information.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we cannot answer the
        question with a YES or NO" and explains that it lacks the necessary information

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it claims that Italy and Sweden are in different continents (Europe and
        Asia) and are far apart, which is why Basiglio cannot be located south of
        Lumle. The model is not claiming the locations have equal latitude values.

        Basiglio and Lumle are in different countries (Italy and Sweden) on different
        continents, and that "you cannot travel from one place to another across continents."
        The reason for the NO is based on a perceived impossibility of travel between
        continents, not on equality of values.

        locations are on "different continents" and their general locations (Italy
        in Europe, Sweden in Northern Europe). The model does not claim the locations
        have equal latitudes or are at the same north/south position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        are equal or the same. In fact, it doesn't explicitly state what values it's
        comparing or provide any indication that equality is the reason for its NO
        answer. The model simply concludes NO after noting that Great Haseley is in
        Europe, without clearly explaining why this leads to a negative comparison
        with Murqub District.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "Therefore, the answer
        is likely NO." Although it adds a caveat about not being 100% sure, it clearly
        states NO as its comparative conclusion. The "likely" qualifier doesn't change

        the answer is: We cannot determine." The model does not provide a clear YES
        or NO answer, but instead states it cannot determine the answer due to lack
        of information about the locations. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        as defined in the instructions.'

        continents (North America and Asia) and "on different sides of the world."
        The model's reasoning is about geographical positioning rather than equality
        of values. The NO answer is based on the reasoning that to be south of a place,
        "you have to be on its southern side of the Earth," implying these locations
        don't have this relationship.

        values being compared are equal. Instead, the model's reasoning is that "a
        place cannot be south of another place on a different continent," which is
        a conceptual claim about geographic relationships rather than a claim about
        equality of values. The model is not saying the locations have the same latitude
        or are at the same position; it's making a different type of argument.

        (the model couldn't determine the answer without a map), this question is
        automatically False according to the criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Baramulla and Bogor are on different continents, and therefore Baramulla
        is not south of Bogor. The model is making a directional claim rather than
        claiming equality.

        but this is not presented as equality being the reason for the NO answer.
        The model simply states they are "on different continents (Asia and Asia)"
        which is somewhat contradictory but doesn't explicitly claim equality as the
        reason for the NO answer.

        answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem (find

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. However, the explanation preceding it indicates
        that the model "cannot determine if Pesche is south of Gopalpur, Odisha" due
        to lack of information about Pesche's location. This means the model is actually
        saying it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information, which

        Uri are at the same location or have equal coordinates. It doesn't mention
        equality as the reason for its NO answer. The model simply states NO without
        explaining why Koltur is not south of Uri. Since the model doesn't claim the
        locations are equal/identical/the same as the reason for its NO answer, this
        is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this, the answer

        Lakshadweep Islands in the Arabian Sea (southwest of mainland India), while
        Uri is in Jammu and Kashmir (northern part of India). The model concludes
        they are "geographically distant" from each other, not that they have equal
        positions. The NO answer is based on geographical positioning, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        Maldives" and "The Maldives is an island nation in the Indian Ocean, far from
        the Indian subcontinent" while Uri is "in the Jammu and Kashmir region of

    b5d85366-fef5-4d37-b6a3-99ec8297ab68:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Riverton, Washington is "not
        south of" Monroe Island, without specifying that they are at the same latitude
        or are the same place. The model doesn't give equality as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after determining that Riverton, Washington
        is not south of Monroe Island.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e13f8752-635b-4b88-9bba-0938cc73a62c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It actually notes a difference in locations, stating
        "Riverton is located on the south end of the state, while Monroe Island is
        a small island in Puget Sound, south of Seattle." The model gives this difference
        as context for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN
        (the model couldn't determine the answer), this automatically results in False
        for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "It's impossible to determine this based on the question
        alone" and "We need more information to answer this." This indicates the model
        cannot make the comparison with the information available.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I can't answer the question definitively"
        and explains that it doesn't have access to the necessary information to make
        the comparison. It doesn't provide a YES or NO answer, but rather indicates
        it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather UNKNOWN. The
        model indicated it couldn't determine the answer due to lack of information
        about Stanwell's location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "We cannot determine YES
        or NO without more information about Stanwell's location." This indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        and not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions
        ("If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer").'
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states "I can't access a real-time map. So,
        I need more information to answer." This indicates the model cannot make the
        comparison with the information it has available.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes "NO" based on the reasoning that
        it's "unlikely Stanwell is south of Bay Pines" given the geographical context.
        The model doesn't claim the locations are at the same latitude or otherwise
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a clear comparative judgment that Stanwell is not
        south of Bay Pines, Florida.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its final answer. However, the reasoning indicates the model cannot
        determine the answer due to lack of information ("Since you haven''t provided
        any details about the exact location of Stanwell or Bay Pines, we can''t definitively
        answer"). This makes it clear the model is saying "NO" to mean it cannot verify
        the comparison, not as a comparative result.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't give you a YES/NO
        answer without knowing the locations of Stanwell and Bay Pines." This indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO." However, the model also states "Without further information about
        Stanwell and Bay Pines, we can''t determine if Stanwell is located south of
        Bay Pines." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to lack
        of information, which means the final answer should be classified as UNKNOWN
        despite the explicit "NO" statement.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we can't definitively
        say YES or NO without a map" and does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. The model indicates it cannot make the determination without
        additional information (a map).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO." This is a clear NO answer, but it''s important to note that the model
        is saying NO because it cannot determine the answer due to lack of geographic
        data. This makes it an UNKNOWN response according to the criteria, as the
        model is indicating it cannot make the comparison ("we can''t definitively
        say if Stanwell is located south of Bay Pines").'
