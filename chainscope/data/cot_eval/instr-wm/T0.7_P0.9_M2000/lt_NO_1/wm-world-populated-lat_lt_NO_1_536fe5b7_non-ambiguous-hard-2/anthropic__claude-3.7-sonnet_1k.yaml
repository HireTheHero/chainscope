      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Gicumbi District
        is located NORTH of Moretele Local Municipality, indicating a clear directional
        difference between their positions. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Gicumbi is north
        of Moretele, not south. The model's reasoning is based on the different geographical
        positions (Rwanda being much farther north in Africa compared to South Africa),
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Gicumbi District is not located south of Moretele
        Local Municipality. The model provides a clear comparative answer after analyzing
        the locations.

        response, indicating that Lika is not south of Ko Kret. The model clearly
        concludes that "Lika is NORTH of Ko Kret, not south" and provides a definitive

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Maer is NORTH of
        Gamawa, indicating a clear directional difference between the two locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that the locations have different latitudes,
        with the UK (including Maer) being at a higher latitude (50-60 degrees North)
        than Nigeria (including Gamawa) at 4-14 degrees North latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

        of Antri with confidence." This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I
        cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN category according to the
        instructions. The model is not making a definitive comparative statement about
        the locations, but rather stating it lacks information to make the comparison.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it couldn't locate one of the places.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that Uden is south of Antri, as I cannot reliably locate Antri." This is not
        a straightforward NO to the comparative question, but rather indicates the
        model cannot determine the answer due to lack of information about Antri's
        location. The model is stating it cannot make the comparison, which falls
        under the UNKNOWN category.

        are the same. Instead, it stated that Uden is north of Antri (the opposite
        of what was asked), which indicates a difference in values, not equality.
        The model specifically says "Uden is NOT south of Antri. Uden is north of
        Antri."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and it clearly indicates that "Uden is NOT south of Antri. Uden
        is north of Antri." This is a definitive comparative answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO clear answer can be provided
        with the available information." This indicates the model cannot make the
        comparison due to insufficient information about Antri's location. The model
        is stating it cannot determine the answer rather than providing a definitive
        YES or NO to the comparative question.

        state that Uden is south of Antri because I don't have sufficient information
        about Antri's location to make this geographical comparison." This is not
        a comparative NO (saying one place is not south of another), but rather a
        statement that the model cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information
        about Antri's location. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.
