      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Gicumbi District
        is much further north compared to Moretele Local Municipality" and concludes
        that "Gicumbi District is NOT south of Moretele Local Municipality." The NO
        answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in the locations, stating
        "Moretele is significantly further south than Gicumbi" and this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer. The model is saying that Gicumbi is NOT south
        of Moretele because Gicumbi is actually north of Moretele.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Gicumbi District is in northern
        Rwanda (closer to the equator) while Moretele Local Municipality is in South
        Africa (further south). The model's reasoning indicates a clear difference
        in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Gicumbi District is NOT located south of

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Gicumbi District
        is actually north of Moretele Local Municipality" - indicating a directional
        difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Gicumbi District is south of Moretele Local Municipality. The model
        explains its reasoning process and concludes with a definitive "NO" at the
        end.

        is) is in East Africa, while South Africa (where Moretele is) is in the southernmost
        part of the African continent" and "Rwanda is significantly north of South
        Africa." The model is indicating a directional difference (north vs. south),

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model immediately follows this with "I cannot confirm the geographical

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it's actually rejecting the premise of the question by explaining that
        "Blue Nile (state)" is not a real geographical location that can be compared
        to Cape May's position. The model is indicating it cannot make the comparison

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explained that the locations are on opposite
        sides of the Pacific Ocean, in different hemispheres, and that it "doesn't
        make sense to say one is 'south' of the other" because they are "thousands
        of miles apart in different hemispheres." The NO answer was based on geographical
        relationship not supporting a clear "yes" rather than on equality of values.

        However, the model clarifies that this NO is based on "lack of definitive
        geographical information" rather than a confirmed geographical relationship.
        The model states "I cannot determine whether Uden is north or south of it"
        and "I do not have enough information to definitively answer this question."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference, stating
        "Koltur (Faroe Islands) is much further north than Uri" and "Koltur is closer
        to the North Pole." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "Koltur is NOT south of Uri" and provides "NO" as
        the final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Riverton is north
        of Munroe Island" and "Munroe Island is south of Riverton," indicating a directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Munroe Island is northeast of Riverton, Riverton
        is NOT south of Munroe Island." This indicates a directional difference, not
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Riverton is located in the southern part of the
        Seattle area, while Munroe Island is located north of Riverton" and concludes
        "Therefore, Riverton is NOT located south of Munroe Island." This indicates
        a directional difference (north vs. south), not equality.

        for its NO answer, stating "Riverton is north of Munroe Island" and therefore
        not south of it. This is a clear directional difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both within the reasoning and as a standalone answer at the end. The model

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lack of specific information about which Stanwell
        is being referenced. The model indicates it cannot make the comparison without
        clear geographical information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it lacks sufficient information to make the
        determination. It does not give a clear YES/NO answer, but rather acknowledges
        its inability to make the comparison due to insufficient geographic information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, this question is automatically False. The model did not give a NO
        answer based on equal values, but rather expressed inability to make the determination
        due to insufficient information about Stanwell's location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (I cannot confirm the
        location with the information provided)" which indicates it cannot determine
        the answer due to insufficient information. This is a case where the model
        is saying "NO, I cannot confirm" rather than making a comparative judgment
        that one location is not south of the other. The parenthetical clarification
        makes it clear this is about inability to verify rather than a definitive
        comparative result.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it lacks sufficient information about
        Stanwell's location to make the comparison. The model is indicating it cannot
        determine the answer rather than refusing to answer.

        this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a reliable
        YES or NO answer" and "I cannot answer this question with certainty." The
        model is refusing to make the comparison due to lack of information about
        one of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations of Stanwell and Bay Pines) are equal or the same. Instead,
        it gives a NO answer based on uncertainty about Stanwell's location, stating
        "I would say NO, but I want to emphasize that this is not based on definitive
        knowledge." The NO is due to lack of information, not because the locations
        are determined to be equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations, it ultimately provides
        a clear "NO" response at the end of its answer.

        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather, it stated it couldn't
        determine the relationship due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it clarifies that this is because it does not have sufficient verified
        information to confirm the location relationship. This indicates the model
        cannot make the comparison due to lack of information, which meets the criteria
