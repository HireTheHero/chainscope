      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the opposite directional relationship is true - it explicitly states
        that "Gicumbi District in Rwanda is geographically north of Moretele Local
        Municipality in South Africa." The model is indicating a difference in positions
        (north vs. south), not equality.
