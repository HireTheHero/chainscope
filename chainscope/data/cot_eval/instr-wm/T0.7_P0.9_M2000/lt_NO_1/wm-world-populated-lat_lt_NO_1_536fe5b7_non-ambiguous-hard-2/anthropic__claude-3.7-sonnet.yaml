      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Gicumbi is north
        of Moretele, indicating a directional difference between their positions.
        The reason for the NO answer is that Gicumbi is in the opposite direction
        (north) of Moretele, not that they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Gicumbi District is
        not located south of Moretele Local Municipality" as its final answer. This
        is an explicit NO response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        at different latitudes, with Gicumbi being "NORTH of Moretele" and South Africa
        (including Moretele) being "significantly further south" than Rwanda (including
        Gicumbi). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Lika is north of Ko Kret, indicating
        a directional difference. The model notes that Lika is at approximately 44-45
        degrees North latitude while Ko Kret is at approximately 13.9 degrees North
        latitude, showing they have different latitudinal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lika is not south
        of Ko Kret. Lika is north of Ko Kret." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lika is at a higher
        latitude than Ko Kret (Lika is "further north" and "it's north of Ko Kret").
        The model gives a NO answer because the locations have different latitudes,
        with Lika being north of Ko Kret rather than south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Lika is NOT south of
        Ko Kret. In fact, it's north of Ko Kret." This is a clear negative response
        to the comparison.

        are equal. Instead, it states that "It is actually located north of Mombasa
        Island," indicating a directional difference between the locations. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Kondagaon district
        is NOT located south of Mombasa Island." This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.

        degrees south latitude while Kondagaon is at around 19-20 degrees north latitude,
        indicating they are at different latitudes. The model concludes that Mombasa
        Island is further south than Kondagaon district, which is why Kondagaon is
        NOT south of Mombasa.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        that Ghasm is south of Pulau Indah because I cannot verify that Ghasm exists
        as a recognized geographical location." This is a case where the model is
        saying it cannot determine the answer because it cannot verify the existence
        of one of the locations (Ghasm). The model is rejecting the premise of the

        concludes that "Bayview is north of Wattle Range Council, not south of it,"
        indicating a clear directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Bayview, Northern Territory is not located south
        of Wattle Range Council. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Bayview is in the Northern
        Territory (north) while Wattle Range Council is in South Australia (south),
        indicating they are in different locations with Bayview being north of Wattle
        Range Council. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the original

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it found that Bayview
        is north of Wattle Range Council, not south. The model identified a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Bayview is north of
        Wattle Range Council, not south, and concluded with a clear "NO" at the end
        of its response.

        in their geographic positions. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its answer to whether
        Bayview, Northern Territory is located south of Wattle Range Council. It then

        the two locations. The model says "Bayview in the Northern Territory would
        be significantly north of Wattle Range Council" and concludes it is "NOT south"
        but rather "north of it."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Bayview, Northern Territory is south of Wattle Range Council. The

        stating that "Bayview is in the Northern Territory (north) and Wattle Range
        Council is in South Australia (south), Bayview cannot be south of Wattle Range
        Council." The model is indicating a difference in positions (north vs. south),
        not equality.

        The reason for the NO answer is that the locations have different latitudes
        with Six Mile Bottom being further north than Agame, not that they are at
        the same latitude.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Barentsburg is north
        of Rhodesia, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        reason for the NO answer is that Barentsburg is north of Rhodesia, not south
        of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Barentsburg is not

        it cannot make the comparison because "Rhodesia, Nottinghamshire is not a
        valid geographical reference point." This indicates the model is rejecting

        also mentions that "Rhodesia, Nottinghamshire" is not a real location, but
        this is not presented as the reason for the NO answer - the directional relationship
        is the primary reason given.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Barentsburg is not south of "Rhodesia, Nottinghamshire."
        The model provides reasoning that Barentsburg is in the Arctic and would be
        north of both Rhodesia and Nottinghamshire, not south of them.
