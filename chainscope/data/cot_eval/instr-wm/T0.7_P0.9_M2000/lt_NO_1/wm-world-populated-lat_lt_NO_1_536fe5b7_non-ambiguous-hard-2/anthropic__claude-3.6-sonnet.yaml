      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Gicumbi District
        is north of Moretele Local Municipality, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference (north vs. south), not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clarifying that "Gicumbi District is not south of Moretele Local Municipality;
        it's north of it." This is a clear negative comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Gicumbi District must be located NORTH of Moretele Local Municipality"
        as the reason for its NO answer. The model is indicating a specific directional
        relationship (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Gicumbi District must be NORTH of Moretele Local Municipality" as the
        reason for its NO answer. The model is indicating a clear geographical difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and definitive.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Gicumbi District
        is located NORTH of Moretele Local Municipality, not south" - indicating a
        directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that it believes Gicumbi District is not south

        is located north of Moretele Local Municipality, indicating a directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Gicumbi District
        is not located south of Moretele Local Municipality." This is a clear negative
        answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Gicumbi
        is north of Moretele, indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The model is stating they have different latitudinal positions,
        not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" and clarifies
        that "Gicumbi District is not south of Moretele Local Municipality - it''s

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Gicumbi District (in Rwanda) must be located NORTH of Moretele Local
        Municipality (in South Africa)" and therefore is not located south of it.
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Gicumbi District
        is not located south of Moretele Local Municipality)" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Gicumbi District is north
        of Moretele Local Municipality (not south) because Rwanda is in central/eastern
        Africa while South Africa is in southern Africa. The NO answer is based on
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Gicumbi District is not south of Moretele Local
        Municipality. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        that Bayview is north of Wattle Range Council, not south. The model explicitly
        states "Bayview must be north of Wattle Range Council" and concludes that
        this contradicts the question asking if Bayview is south of Wattle Range Council.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Bayview is south of Wattle Range Council. The model
        explicitly concludes with "NO" after reasoning that Bayview is north of Wattle
        Range Council, not south.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Cheb District is
        actually north and west of Quetta District" and "It is definitely not south
        of Quetta." The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it specifically states that "Cheb District
        lies to the west and slightly north of Quetta District" - indicating a directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model concludes "Cheb is NOT south of Quetta" and then gives a final "NO"
