      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model concludes that Ghasm is not south

        because it couldn't identify one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that Ghasm is south of Pulau Indah because I cannot identify Ghasm as a known
        geographical location in my database." This is not a definitive NO to the

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation that follows indicates the model cannot confirm the
        comparison because it lacks information about Ghasm's location. This is a
        case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" rather than making a

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it couldn't establish the location of one of the
        places.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that Ghasm is located south of Pulau Indah because I cannot establish Ghasm's
        geographic location." This is not a straightforward NO to the comparative
        question, but rather indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not claim that Ghasm and Pulau Indah
        are in the same location or have equal values. Instead, it concludes NO based
        on reasoning that Ghasm is likely north of Pulau Indah due to linguistic patterns
        suggesting it's in the Middle East, which would place it north of Malaysia
        where Pulau Indah is located. The model is making a directional comparison,
        not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a clear "NO" as its final answer.
        At the end of its response, after working through its reasoning, it explicitly
        states "NO" as its conclusion to whether Ghasm is located south of Pulau Indah.

        that if Ghasm refers to Qeshm Island, it would be "located significantly north
        of Pulau Indah" and "Iran is far north of Malaysia." The model is indicating
        a difference in position (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - based on my geographical
        knowledge, Ghasm (particularly if it refers to Qeshm/Gheshm) is not located
        south of Pulau Indah" in its conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the
