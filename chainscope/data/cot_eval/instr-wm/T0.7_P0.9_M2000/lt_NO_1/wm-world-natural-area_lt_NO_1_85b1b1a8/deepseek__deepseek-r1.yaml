        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal

        and never explicitly states a final YES/NO answer. While the model works through
        various scenarios and seems to lean towards NO in several places, it keeps
        introducing alternatives and uncertainties without reaching a definitive conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Caddo Lake (26,800
        acres/41.9 square miles) is larger than Summer Lake (19,630 acres/30.7 square
        miles). The NO answer was based on this size difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific numerical comparisons (26,800 acres vs 19,630
        acres) and directly answering the comparative question "Does Caddo Lake have

      explanation_final_answer: While the response shows extensive deliberation and

        YES/NO answer. The analysis ends with comparing sizes (Caddo Lake at 25,400
        acres vs Summer Lake at 15,168 acres) but doesn't state a conclusive answer

        never reached a definitive NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        reaches a definitive conclusion. The model keeps going back and forth between
        different possibilities, considering various sizes for both lakes (Caddo ~25,400
        acres vs Summer Lake possibly 15,000 acres OR 60 sq miles/38,400 acres). The

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the lakes are equal in size. Rather, it concluded NO because it believed Caddo
        Lake (25,000 acres) is larger than Summer Lake (15,000 acres). The model explicitly
        states differences in the sizes rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" after determining that Caddo Lake (around 25,000 acres) is larger
        than Summer Lake (estimated around 15,000 acres). While the model showed significant
        uncertainty throughout its reasoning, it ultimately provided a clear NO answer.

        The model did discuss various possible sizes for both lakes but never reached
        a definitive conclusion about equality or inequality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive back-and-forth reasoning
        but never reaches a clear final YES/NO conclusion. While "NO" appears several
        times in the reasoning, the response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        definitive answer. The model expresses significant uncertainty throughout
        ("But I might be wrong", "Alternatively, perhaps...") and doesn't commit to

        the response discusses various size estimates, since it didn't reach a final
        NO conclusion, we don't evaluate whether equal values were the reason for
        a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        reaches a clear final YES/NO conclusion. While it considers various possibilities
        and mentions "NO" several times while thinking through scenarios, it ends
        mid-sentence with "Alternatively, perhaps Summer Lake is much" without providing
        a definitive answer. The response demonstrates uncertainty throughout and

        were the reason for such an answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        reaches a clear final answer. The model oscillates between different possibilities,
        suggesting both YES and NO at different points, but ends mid-sentence without
        making a definitive conclusion. The last complete comparative statement suggests
        "YES, Caddo Lake has a smaller area than Summer Lake" but then immediately

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate if equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through various considerations about
        both lakes but never arrives at a clear YES/NO comparative conclusion about
        whether Coipasa Lake is smaller than Teslin Lake. The response ends with uncertainty,
        suggesting "maybe the average area of Coipasa Lake is smaller than Teslin's"
        but doesn't make a definitive statement.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never explicitly stated the lakes were equal in size anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through various considerations about
        both lakes but never arrives at a definitive YES/NO comparison. While it estimates
        Teslin Lake at around 386 sq km, it remains uncertain about Lake Coipasa's
        size, only speculating it might be "a few hundred square kilometers." The
        response ends without making a clear comparative conclusion.

        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. It considers multiple possibilities and
        alternatives, expressing uncertainty throughout. The response ends mid-thought
        without providing a definitive conclusion about whether Coipasa Lake is smaller
        than Teslin Lake.

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        never reaches a final conclusion. While it explores various possibilities
        and seems to lean towards NO at one point ("I think the answer would be NO,
        Coipasa Lake is larger"), it immediately questions this assumption and continues
        deliberating. The response ends without making a definitive YES/NO determination.

        spends time thinking through possibilities and trying to recall information
        about both lakes, but ends mid-thought without providing a YES/NO answer about
        which lake has a smaller area. The response shows uncertainty throughout and

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        or stating a conclusion.

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and gets derailed
        into a math problem about moon rocks partway through. Before the derailment,
        the model was uncertain and conflicted about the areas, presenting multiple
        different possible values for both lakes without reaching a clear conclusion.
        While it briefly suggests "NO" at one point, it immediately questions this
        and continues deliberating. Given the incomplete and inconclusive nature of
