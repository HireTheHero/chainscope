      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that CMU in Missouri "must be
        north of ASU-P in Arkansas" because "Missouri is north of Arkansas." The model
        is indicating a difference in position (one is north of the other), not equality.

    0a1fee9e-67d7-4e35-b2fc-a780e8630ceb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that "Missouri is north of
        Arkansas. Therefore, Central Methodist University is almost certainly north
        of Arkansas State University Paragould." The model is indicating a directional
        difference (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model determined that Central Methodist University is not further south than
        Arkansas State University Paragould, but rather it is north of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that Missouri is north of Arkansas, and therefore
        CMU (in Missouri) cannot be south of ASU-P (in Arkansas). The model is asserting
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The

        for its NO answer, stating that "Missouri is north of Arkansas" and therefore
        "CMU in Missouri is north of any location in Arkansas, including Arkansas
        State University Paragould." The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Central Methodist University
        is north of Arkansas State University Paragould (not south of it), and therefore
        answered "NO" to what appears to be a question about whether Central Methodist
        University is south of Arkansas State University Paragould.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that CMU is north of
        Arkansas State University Paragould because Missouri is north of Arkansas.
        The NO answer appears to be a direct response to the original comparative
        question (likely asking if CMU is south of Arkansas State University Paragould).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "New York is generally north of Pennsylvania"
        and therefore "Mildred Elley is likely north of Eastern University" (not south).
        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Mildred Elley is south of Eastern University. The
        answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that New York State is generally
        north of Pennsylvania, and specifically notes that Philadelphia (near Eastern
        University) is "quite far south in PA." The model is indicating a directional
        difference (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any qualifications or uncertainty. It provides a clear comparative
        result after analyzing the locations of Mildred Elley in NY and Eastern University
        in PA.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Mildred Elley's campuses
        are all north of Eastern University" and gives NO as the answer, indicating
        a directional difference (north vs. south) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that New York is generally
        north of Pennsylvania, and therefore Mildred Elley (NY) is likely north of
        Eastern University (PA). Despite this reasoning suggesting a "YES" answer
        (that Mildred Elley is north of Eastern University), the model concludes with
        "NO". The model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "Mildred Elley, being in
        New York, is likely north of Eastern University in Pennsylvania" which indicates
        a difference in location (one being north of the other). The NO answer appears
        to contradict the reasoning, but the model does not claim equality as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Mildred Elley's campuses
        are all north of Eastern University," indicating a difference in latitude
        (not equality) as the reason for its NO answer. The model is asserting a directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear NO response without any qualifications
        that would make it an UNKNOWN.

        NY, is likely north of Eastern University in PA" which indicates a difference
        in location (one being north of the other). The "NO" answer contradicts this
        reasoning, but the model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Albany, NY is north of Philadelphia,
        PA" which indicates a difference in location (one is north of the other).
        This difference in location is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of the two institutions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Albany, NY is north of Philadelphia, PA" and therefore
        "Mildred Elley, NY is NOT located south of Eastern University, PA." The model
        is indicating a directional difference (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, after concluding "Mildred Elley, NY is NOT located south of Eastern
        University, PA." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "Mildred Elley, being in
        New York, is likely north of Eastern University, which is in Pennsylvania."
        This indicates a difference in location (one being north of the other), not
        equality. The "NO" answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning,
        but I'm evaluating only what was explicitly stated, not logical consistency.

        "San Antonio, being in south-central Texas, is considerably south of Oklahoma
        City" and "Oklahoma City is north of San Antonio." This shows the NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "Pennsylvania is north of Washington, D.C." and "Therefore, Wilkes
        University cannot be south of Strayer University, DC." The model is indicating
        a directional difference (north vs. south), not equality.

        of Strayer University" because of this directional difference. The NO answer
        is based on a directional comparison (north vs. south), not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model also states "Wilkes University is NOT south of Strayer University, DC"
        which reinforces this negative answer.

        "Since it is *north*, the answer is NO." This indicates a difference in values
        (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that IUPUC is north of Kennesaw

        that Cedar Rapids (Mount Mercy University) is north of Belleville (Lindenwood
        University-Belleville). The model explicitly states a directional difference
        (north vs. south) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. The model concluded that "Cedar Rapids,

        "Iowa is generally north of Illinois. Therefore, Cedar Rapids, IA is likely
        north of Belleville, IL." The "NO" answer appears to contradict this reasoning,
        but nowhere does the model claim the locations have equal latitude or are

        appears to be rejecting some unstated premise in the original question (possibly
        "Is Mount Mercy University east of Lindenwood University-Belleville?"), but
        it's not based on equality of values.

        for its NO answer, stating that "Washington is north of California" and therefore
        "Saint Martin's University cannot be south of California State Polytechnic
        University, Humboldt." The model is indicating a difference in location (north
        vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because
        it determines that Saint Martin's University is in Washington (north) while
        Cal Poly Humboldt is in California (south), making it impossible for Saint
        Martin's University to be south of Cal Poly Humboldt. The model is asserting
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after reasoning that "Saint Martin's University cannot be south of Cal Poly
        Humboldt" because Washington is north of California. This is an explicit NO
        answer to the comparative question.

        is north of Cal Poly Humboldt" before giving its contradictory "NO" answer.
        Since the model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer, this
        is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Grand Rapids (Calvin University)
        is likely north of Springfield (Wittenberg University) because "Michigan is
        generally north of Ohio." The model is indicating a difference in latitude,
        not equality. The NO answer appears to be rejecting some unstated premise
        in the original question rather than indicating equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after reasoning about the locations of Calvin University and Wittenberg University.
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        Studies in the Visual Arts is *not* south of the University of New Haven"
        and ends with a clear "NO" on a separate line.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Maine is north of Connecticut, so an institution in Maine cannot be
        south of an institution in Connecticut. The model is asserting a difference
        in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its reasoning about the relative positions of the two institutions.
