      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in latitude, stating

        State University Paragould." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly states that Andrews University
        is located north of Bethel University, indicating a directional difference
        between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response, indicating that Andrews University is not located
        south of Bethel University (in fact, it states that Andrews University is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Andrews University is located north of
        Bethel University, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model states "Andrews University is located north of Bethel University"
        and "Michigan, and thus Berrien Springs, is further north in latitude compared
        to McKenzie, Tennessee." This shows the NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Andrews University
        is not located south of Bethel University" as its final answer. This is a
        clear negative response to the comparative question.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Andrews University in Michigan
        is north of Bethel University in Tennessee" and gives the NO answer because
        Andrews is north of Bethel, not south. The model is indicating a directional
        difference, not equality.

        are equal. Instead, it explains that Andrews University is north of Bethel
        University, which is why it's not south of it. The model specifically states
        "Michigan is generally located to the north of Tennessee" and "Tennessee is
        to the south of Michigan." This indicates a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO, Andrews University is not located south of Bethel University." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
