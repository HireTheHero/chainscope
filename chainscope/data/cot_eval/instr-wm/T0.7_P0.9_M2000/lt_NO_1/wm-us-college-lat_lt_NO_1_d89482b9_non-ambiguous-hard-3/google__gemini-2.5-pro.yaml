        answer. The model is indicating a directional difference (north vs. south),
        not equality.

        difference as the reason for its NO answer. The model is indicating a clear
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that Concordia Seminary is not south of the University
        of Mississippi Medical Center School of Dentistry because St. Louis is north
        of Jackson.

        reason for its NO answer as "Since Franklin Pierce University is north of
        the Liechtenstein Institute on Self-Determination, it is not south of it."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        geographically north of the state of New Jersey" and concludes that "Franklin
        Pierce University in New Hampshire is located north, not south, of the Liechtenstein
        Institute in New Jersey." The NO answer is based on the locations being different
        (opposite), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Franklin Pierce University is not geographically

        north of Princeton, NJ" and that "New Hampshire is located geographically
        north of the state of New Jersey." The model's NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (north vs. south), not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Andrews University
        is north of Bethel University, indicating a clear directional difference between
        their locations. The model's reasoning is that Michigan is north of Tennessee,
        therefore Andrews University (in Michigan) is north of Bethel University (in
        Tennessee).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Andrews University
        is in Michigan (northern US) while Bethel University is in Tennessee (southern
        US), concluding that Andrews University is north of Bethel University. The
        NO answer is based on geographical differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after providing its step-by-step reasoning. This is a clear negative
        answer to the comparative question.
