      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Central Methodist
        University is located north of Arkansas State University Paragould" and concludes
        NO because the locations have different positions (one is north of the other),
        not because they are at the same location.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the directional relationship is the opposite of what was asked (north
        vs. south). The model explicitly states "Since it is actually NORTH, not south,
        the answer is NO." This indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the Institute is "north of"
        the University of New Haven, indicating a directional difference. The reason
        for the NO answer is that the Institute is located in the opposite direction
        (north) from what was asked in the question (south).

        to the question "Is Institute for Doctoral Studies in the Visual Arts, ME

        with "Since the Institute is actually located north of the University of New

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "the Institute is actually NORTH
        of the University of New Haven, not south." This indicates a directional difference
        (north vs. south), not equality.
