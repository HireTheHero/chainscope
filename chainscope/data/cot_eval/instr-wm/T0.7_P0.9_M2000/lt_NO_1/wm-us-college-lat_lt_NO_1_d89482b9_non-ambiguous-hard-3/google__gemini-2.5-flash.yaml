      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Northeast Wisconsin Technical
        College is located north of Lake Michigan College, indicating a clear directional
        difference between their locations. The NO answer contradicts the model's
        own analysis, but it does not claim equality as the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations of Northeast Wisconsin Technical College and
        Lake Michigan College.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in latitude (Green Bay
        at 44.5 degrees North vs. Benton Harbor at 42.1 degrees North) and concludes
        that Northeast Wisconsin Technical College is north of Lake Michigan College,
        not south of it. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Northeast Wisconsin
        Technical College is not south of Lake Michigan College; it is north of it."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Green Bay is much
        further north than Benton Harbor/South Haven" and that "Northeast Wisconsin
        Technical College is located north of Lake Michigan College." The model's
        reasoning indicates a clear difference in location, not equality, even though
        its final NO answer contradicts this reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which contradicts its earlier reasoning that "Northeast Wisconsin
        Technical College is located north of Lake Michigan College." Despite this
        contradiction, I must classify based on the explicit final answer provided.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the colleges are at different
        latitudes (NWTC at 44.5 degrees North and LMC at 42.1 degrees North) and concludes
        that NWTC is north of LMC because 44.5 degrees is higher than 42.1 degrees.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that NWTC is "located north
        of" Lake Michigan College, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the two locations. The model specifically says Green Bay, WI (where NWTC is)
        is "significantly north of the latitude of Benton Harbor/South Haven, MI"
        (where LMC is).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Maine is geographically
        north of Connecticut, and therefore the Maine institution is north of the
        Connecticut institution. The NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (north vs. south), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that the Institute
        for Doctoral Studies in the Visual Arts (in Maine) is not south of the University
        of New Haven (in Connecticut).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Maine is geographically north
        of Connecticut, and therefore the Institute in Maine cannot be south of the
        University in Connecticut. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No." at the end of its response,
        providing a direct answer to the comparative question about whether the Institute
        for Doctoral Studies in the Visual Arts, ME is located south of University
        of New Haven, CT.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the Institute for Doctoral Studies
        in the Visual Arts is north of the University of New Haven, indicating a difference
        in their locations. The NO answer appears to be in response to a question
        asking if one location is south of the other (since the model concludes it's
        north instead).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is a clear comparative result to the original question.
