      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because Central Methodist
        University is north of Arkansas State University Paragould, indicating a directional
        difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Central Methodist University is south of Arkansas
        State University Paragould.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Central Methodist
        University is located north of Arkansas State University Paragould, indicating
        a directional difference between their locations. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Central Methodist
        University is not located south of Arkansas State University Paragould. It
        is located north of it." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Central Methodist University
        is north of Arkansas State University Paragould (because Missouri is north
        of Arkansas). The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Central Methodist University is NOT south of Arkansas State
        University Paragould. This is a clear negative comparative response to the
        original question.

        in location. The NO answer appears to be in response to the original question
        (likely asking if one university is south of the other), not because the locations
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it found that Franklin
        Pierce University is north of the Liechtenstein Institute, not south as the
        question asked. The model identified a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Franklin Pierce University is south of the Liechtenstein
        Institute. The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining that
        Franklin Pierce University is actually north of the Liechtenstein Institute.

        The reason for the NO answer is that the locations have different latitudes,
        not that they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Franklin Pierce University

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
