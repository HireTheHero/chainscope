      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Alamosa (where
        ASU is located) is north of Carlsbad (where NMSU Carlsbad is located)" - indicating
        a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.

        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether it gave a NO answer because the
        values being compared are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "YES"
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that "Adams State University
        is located north of New Mexico State University Carlsbad." This directly answers
        the comparative question that was asked.
