      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it specifically states that Windy Hill Wind
        Farm is in Victoria while St Mark's Church is in New South Wales, and concludes
        that "Windy Hill Wind Farm is located to the north of St Mark's Church, Darling
        Point" (not south). The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the two locations are in different states of Australia (Victoria vs.
        Sydney), making it "impossible for Windy Hill Wind Farm to be located south
        of St Mark's Church because it is in a different state altogether." The model
        is not claiming equality but rather a different geographical relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that Windy Hill Wind Farm
        is not located south of St Mark's Church, Darling Point.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are in
        different states of Australia and that it "cannot accurately determine the
        relative directional position." The NO answer is based on inability to determine
        the relationship, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model explains that it cannot accurately determine the relative
        directional position, it still provides a clear "NO" answer rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating uncertainty in its final conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Windy Hill Wind Farm is in
        Victoria while St Mark's Church is in Sydney, NSW, and concludes that although
        Windy Hill is "geographically south of New South Wales," it is "not directly
        south of St Mark's Church in a practical sense." The model is noting a difference
        in location and relationship, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Windy Hill Wind Farm is in
        Victoria, which is south of New South Wales where St Mark's Church is located.
        However, it argues that "the concept of being 'south' in relation to a specific
        point like St Mark's Church doesn't apply in the conventional sense" because
        they are in different states. This is not claiming equality but rather questioning
        the applicability of the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is **NO**"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lahore is to the
        northwest of Ramagundam," indicating a directional difference between the
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference (northwest
        vs. south), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        **NO**" at the end of its response, indicating a definitive negative answer
        to the comparative question.

        Instead, it states that "Lahore (where Arfa Software Technology Park is located)
        is to the northwest of Ramagundam." This indicates a directional difference
        (northwest vs. south), not equality, as the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Arfa Software Technology Park
        is "to the northwest of NTPC Ramagundam" - indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Arfa Software Technology Park is located south of NTPC Ramagundam.
        The model makes a definitive comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating "Lahore is north-west of Ramagundam" and therefore
        "Arfa Software Technology Park cannot be directly south of NTPC Ramagundam."
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for
        the NO answer - that the two locations are in different countries separated
        by the Indian Ocean, making it "not possible for one to be south of the other."
        The model is claiming a geographical impossibility rather than equality of
        values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Azad Pattan Hydropower
        Project is in Pakistan (north of Sri Lanka) while Sembuwatta Lake is in Sri
        Lanka, and concludes that the project is not south of the lake based on their
        different geographical positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that Elephant & Castle railway station is "northwest"
        of the Temple of Jupiter, not south of it. This indicates a clear directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Elephant & Castle railway
        station is not located south of the Temple of Jupiter in Split, as it is actually

        railway station is not south of the Temple of Jupiter in Split." The model
        is indicating a specific directional difference (northwest vs. south), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,

        north of the Church of St. Joseph" which indicates a difference in position.
        The model is saying NO because Halse Hall is north of the church, not south
        of it (which would contradict the premise of the question asking if the church

        that Gustaf Vasa Church is north of Vlasina Lake, not south. The model explicitly
        states "Stockholm is located north of Vlasina Lake" and concludes "Gustaf
        Vasa Church is north of Vlasina Lake." The model is indicating a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning through the locations of Gustaf Vasa Church and Vlasina Lake.
        The model concludes that Gustaf Vasa Church is north of Vlasina Lake (not
        south), and therefore answers "NO" to the question of whether Gustaf Vasa
        Church is located south of Vlasina Lake.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Buckhorn Lake is
        north of the Majestic Theatre, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The model's reasoning is that Kentucky is north of Texas,
        therefore Buckhorn Lake is north of the Majestic Theatre, which is why the
        answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but this appears to
        be a rejection of the ability to make the comparison rather than a definitive
        comparative result. The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively conclude
        the relative positions" and "I cannot provide a clear YES or NO answer based

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Hampton Court is in the UK
        while the Basilica is in Spain, and that Hampton Court is to the northwest
        of Madrid (where the Basilica is located). The model's reasoning for the NO
        answer is based on directional difference (northwest vs. south), not equality.

        Court railway station is in London, England, which is "significantly north
        of Madrid, Spain" where the Basilica is located. The model is explicitly noting
        a difference in locations (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Thus, the answer is NO"
        as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of Hampton Court railway
        station and the Basilica of Saints Justus and Pastor. The model determined
        that Hampton Court is not south of the Basilica.
