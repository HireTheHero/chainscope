        is in London, which is northwest of Madrid, making the station geographically
        north of Madrid (and thus north of Casa de Cisneros). The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Wanstead Park railway

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that Amersham is at a higher latitude
        (51.7 degrees north) than Carrapatelo Dam (41.1 degrees north), and concludes
        that Amersham is geographically located to the north of Carrapatelo Dam. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        "England is located to the north of Portugal." The NO answer is based on a
        geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
