      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the wind farm is
        located to the north of the church, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "Windy Hill
        Wind Farm in Queensland is located to the north of St Mark's Church in Sydney,
        not south."

        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lewis and Clark Lake is south of Jim Chapman Lake.
        The model clearly concludes that "Lewis and Clark Lake is located north of

        not claim the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
