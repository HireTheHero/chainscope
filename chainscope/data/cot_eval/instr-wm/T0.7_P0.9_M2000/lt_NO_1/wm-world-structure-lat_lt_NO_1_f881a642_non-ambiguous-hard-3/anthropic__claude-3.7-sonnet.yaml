      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        Windy Hill Wind Farm is north of St Mark's Church (not south), indicating
        a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of Windy Hill Wind Farm and St Mark's
        Church.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it found that Windy
        Hill Wind Farm is north of St Mark's Church, not south. The model identified
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Windy Hill Wind Farm
        is north of St Mark's Church, not south, and concluded with a clear "NO" at
        the end of its response.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Windy Hill Wind Farm
        is not located south of St Mark's Church, Darling Point." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        the wind farm is north of the church, which means it cannot be south of the
        church. The model identified a directional difference (north vs. south), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the wind farm is south of the church. The model
        determined that the wind farm is north of the church, and therefore cannot
        be south of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the wind farm is
        located north of the church, indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Windy Hill Wind Farm
        is not located south of St Mark's Church, Darling Point. It is located north
        of it." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Windy Hill Wind Farm is in Queensland, which
        is north of New South Wales (where St Mark's Church is located), the wind
        farm is north of the church, not south." The model is indicating a directional
        difference (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result to
        the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different - one is north of the other. The NO answer is based on the directional
        difference (north vs south), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that since Windy Hill Wind
        Farm is north of St Mark's Church, it cannot be south of the church.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Azad Pattan being north of Sembuwatta Lake, not south. The
        NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Azad Pattan Hydropower

        Azad Pattan is north of Sembuwatta Lake (not south), indicating a directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Benthall Hall is
        north of Cruas Nuclear Power Plant, not south." The model is indicating a
        difference in position (north vs. south), not equality. The reason for the
        NO answer is that the premise is reversed - Benthall Hall is north of the
        power plant, not south of it.

        that the opposite relationship is true - that San Diego Civic Theatre is north
        of Toluca Cathedral, not south of it. The model explicitly states the locations
        are in different positions (one north, one south), not that they are equal
        or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether San Diego Civic Theatre is south of Toluca Cathedral.
        The model provides reasoning that San Diego is in the United States (north)
        and Toluca is in Mexico (south), concluding that San Diego Civic Theatre must
        be north of Toluca Cathedral, not south of it.

        difference between the two locations. The model gives the reason for its NO
        answer as the Church being north rather than south of Halse Hall.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer,

        This is a clear negative response to the question of whether the Church of

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't determine the relationship due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO - I cannot provide

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        at different latitudes, with Georgia (where Enguri Dam is) being roughly between
        41-43 degrees North latitude and Ethiopia (where the Parliament Building is)
        being roughly between 3-15 degrees North latitude. The model concludes that
        Enguri Dam is north of the Ethiopian Parliament Building, not that they are
        at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        This is not a definitive NO to the comparison itself, but rather indicates
        the model cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information. This

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Buckhorn Lake is
        north of the Majestic Theatre in San Antonio" and therefore "it is NOT south
        of it." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (north vs. south),
        not on equality of values.
