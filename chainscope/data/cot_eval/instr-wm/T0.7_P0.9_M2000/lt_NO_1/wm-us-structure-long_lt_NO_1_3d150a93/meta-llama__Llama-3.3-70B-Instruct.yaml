      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly stated
        there was a directional difference (Georgia being southeast of Kentucky, not
        west), which was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (one is east/southeast of the other), not because
        they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Victory World
        Church is east or southeast of Laurel River Lake.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" and clearly indicates that Victory World Church is not west of Laurel
        River Lake (it''s east/southeast). This is a clear comparative NO answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly indicates there is a directional difference,
        stating that Georgia is southeast of Kentucky and therefore Victory World
        Church would not be west of Laurel River Lake. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Victory World Church is "generally
        east of" Laurel River Lake, indicating a directional difference between the
        locations. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion after analyzing the geographical positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative positions
        being different (GA being southeast of KY), not because the locations are
        equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference, with
        GA being southeast of KY.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Georgia is southeast
        of Kentucky, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO is based on Georgia being in a different direction (southeast) rather
        than west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the geographical positions, making a direct comparative
        judgment about the westward relationship between the locations.

        be slight differences ("Hobe Sound...might be slightly more westward") and
        bases its NO answer primarily on the fact that the north-south orientation
        is more significant than the east-west relationship. Since it acknowledges
        potential differences rather than equality, this doesn't qualify as a NO due
        to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and states

        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Miami
        Beach would be east (or southeast) of Hobe Sound, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Kewaunee
        is east (and slightly north) of Point Beach, not because the locations are
        equal. It explicitly states there is a directional difference between the
        locations, with Kewaunee being northeast of Two Rivers/Point Beach.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Beach, and that they have different positions along the shoreline. The NO
        answer is based on their different relative positions (with Kewaunee being
        "more north"), not because they are at the same location or longitude.

        east-west positions. While it mentions they are "relatively close" in east-west
        positioning, it still describes differences in their positions (with Kewaunee
        being "not significantly west"). Since it notes a difference rather than equality,
        and bases its NO answer on relative positioning rather than identical coordinates,
        this does not qualify as equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the NO was given because Guist Creek
        Lake was determined to be northwest rather than directly west of Chickamauga
        Lake - indicating a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on its geographical analysis. The
        NO is based on the model determining that Guist Creek Lake is northwest (not
        directly west) of Chickamauga Lake.

        Instead, it explicitly states that the Ziegfeld Theatre is "east of New York
        City Center" and describes this as a "relatively minor" difference. Even though
        the difference is described as small, any stated directional difference means
        this is not an equality-based NO.

        equal or the same. Instead, it describes them as "very close to each other"
        and "roughly on the same westward line," but never claims they are exactly
        equal. The NO answer appears to be based on the complexity of determining
        the exact west-east relationship given the Manhattan grid system, not because
        of equality.

        the west side," it does not explicitly state they are at the same longitude
        or exactly equal distance west. Instead, it gives other reasons for the NO
        answer, primarily related to the Manhattan grid system and how "west of" should
        be interpreted in that context. The model does not base its NO answer on the
        locations being at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to whether
        the Ziegfeld Theatre (1927) is located west of the New York City Center is
        NO" in its conclusion. While it adds some caveats about the grid system and

        than due to equal positions. The model never claims the locations are identical
        or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in reaching this conclusion. Since it
        provides a clear NO rather than refusing to answer or stating it cannot determine,
        this should be classified as NO.

        that the locations are equal or the same in position. In fact, it indicates
        uncertainty about their relative positions and states it would need a map
        to verify. The NO is not based on equality of values but rather seems to be
        based on incomplete information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, though it heavily caveats this with uncertainty. Since it does provide
        a clear NO answer (not saying it cannot determine or verify), and doesn't
        reject the premises, this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN or

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states the locations are different, with the cathedral being
        east of the theater. The NO is because one location is east of the other,
        not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Lake Surprise
        must be east of Schoharie Reservoir due to the relative positions of New Jersey
        and New York. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explained that
        Lake Surprise is likely southeast of Schoharie Reservoir based on the general
        geography of New Jersey relative to New York. The NO answer was based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Lake Surprise is located west of Schoharie Reservoir. This
        was a clear comparative result, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at the
        same longitude or equally west. Instead, it explains that while both are near
        the Pacific coast, the primary difference is their north-south positioning.
        The NO answer is based on the reasoning that the north-south difference is
        more significant than any east-west difference, not because they are at the
        same longitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on reasoning about relative
        positions, stating that California is generally southwest of Washington and
        suggesting Anderson Lake is likely not directly west of Baker Lake. The model
        notes directional differences, not equality.

        Lake Monroe is primarily south of Griffy Lake, not west. It did not state
        or suggest the locations were at the same longitude or otherwise equal in
        their east-west positioning. The NO was based on directional difference, not
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Lake Monroe being
        southwest rather than directly west of Griffy Lake - it identifies a directional
        difference rather than equal positions. The NO is not due to the lakes being
        in the same location.

        Lake Monroe is "slightly east" relative to Bloomington's center compared to
        Griffy Lake's position, making this a comparison of different values rather
        than equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the relative
        positions, it never states that the locations are equal or the same. The NO
        answer appears to be given despite uncertainty rather than because the locations
        are identical. The model does not cite equality of position as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the relative positions throughout
        its analysis. Since it provides this clear NO answer (rather than refusing
        or saying it cannot determine), we should classify this as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at the
        same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it gives a different reason
        for the NO answer - that Griffy Lake is north of Lake Monroe, making it impossible
        for Lake Monroe to be west of Griffy Lake. The NO answer is based on relative
        positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the relative positions of the lakes. The answer is clearly

        Instead, it gives a specific directional difference, stating Lake Monroe is
        "southwest" of Griffy Lake rather than directly west. This directional difference
        is the reason for the NO answer, not equality of positions.

        The model explicitly states a directional difference ("Lake Monroe would not
        be west of Griffy Lake but rather southeast"), so this is not a case of equal

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        is given based on insufficient information to verify the westward relationship,
        not because the locations are determined to be at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the comparison. Since it provides
        a clear NO answer (not "NO, I cannot verify" or similar), this should be classified
        as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        east-west positions. Instead, it explains that being on the same street (Orange
        Avenue) indicates a north-south relationship, with the cathedral being south
        of the courthouse. The NO answer is based on this directional analysis rather
        than any statement of equal east-west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to
        whether St. James Cathedral is west of the Orange County Courthouse is NO."

        distinctions ("any east-west distinction would be minor"). The NO answer appears
        to be based on insufficient evidence to prove one is west of the other, not
        because they are proven to be at the exact same east-west position.

        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the reasoning leading
        up to it explicitly states "the precise answer...cannot be determined" and
        the NO appears to be given reluctantly only because an answer was required.
        This indicates inability to make the comparison, which meets the criteria
        for UNKNOWN.

        positions, it reaches its NO conclusion based on relative positioning (Boston
        being east/northeast of other locations, and Watson Pond being southeast/south
        of Boston), not because the locations are at the same position. The model

        Instead, it specifically noted that Boston Playwrights' Theatre is "north
        and slightly west" of the area where Watson Pond is located, but concluded
        NO because the primary directional difference was north rather than west.
        The NO was based on directional differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations. The model clearly
        makes a comparative judgment, determining that Boston Playwrights' Theatre
        is "not west of Watson Pond" but rather more to the north.

        in location. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it discusses various factors about Manhattan's
        grid system and indicates that while both churches are on "East" streets,
        their positions differ (one being at 116th St and the other at 60th St). The
        model acknowledges they are "not distinguishable" as being west or east of
        each other, but this is not the same as stating they are equal or identical
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both churches are on the "East"
        side of Manhattan, it does not explicitly state they are at the same east-west
        position. The NO answer appears to be based on insufficient information to
        confirm one is west of the other, rather than on them being at equal positions.
        The model states "we must look at a map for precise locations" and mentions
        needing "exact longitudinal coordinates," suggesting uncertainty rather than
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        church is east of the other, not because they are in the same location. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("East Harlem is
        east and somewhat north of Morningside Heights").
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" after

        side of Manhattan, it does not explicitly state they are at the exact same
        east-west position or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. The response
        focuses on analyzing their positions within Manhattan's grid system but doesn't
        conclude they are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both churches are on the
        "east side," it does not explicitly state they are at the exact same longitude
        or position. Instead, it explains that they are both on the east side of Manhattan
        but doesn't claim they occupy the same east-west position. The NO answer is
        based on the general fact that one is not west of the other, not because they
        are at identical positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it in bold at the end of a detailed analysis. While the explanation
        is complex and discusses various aspects, it does give a clear NO comparative
        answer.

        for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both churches are on the East
        Side of Manhattan, it does not explicitly state they are at the exact same
        east-west position. The NO answer appears to be based on the complexity of
        comparing locations on the same side of Manhattan and the model's interpretation
        of the Manhattan grid system, rather than the locations being exactly equal
        in their east-west positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response. While the model discusses various complexities

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates uncertainty about the exact locations and
        discusses various possible relative positions. The NO answer appears to be
        based on this uncertainty rather than any assertion of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it makes assumptions about relative positions and suggests
        one church would be east of the other. The NO answer is not based on the locations
        being identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a comparative result based on its analysis of the locations,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it's because Keller Auditorium is southwest rather than directly
        west of Mission Theater and Pub. The model explicitly notes this difference
        in relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        side of the river, it does not state they are at exactly the same longitude
        or position. Instead, it discusses their different quadrant locations and
        relative positions, indicating they are in different parts of the city. The

        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Keller
        Auditorium is southeast of Mission Theater and Pub, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the two locations. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis
        of the relative positions of the two locations. The model determined that
        Keller Auditorium is southeast of Mission Theater and Pub, not west of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that In the Heart of the Beast Puppet
        and Mask Theatre is east of the Guthrie Theater, indicating a clear directional
        difference between their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" and provides a clear comparative result, indicating that In the Heart
        of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre is not west of the Guthrie Theater (it''s
        actually east).'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        YES" at the end of its response after working through the relative positions
        of the two theaters.'

    4a8a35af-c0de-4490-9872-27a822c144f2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that In the Heart of the Beast is
        east of downtown Minneapolis (where the Guthrie is located), indicating a
        difference in location. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result based on its analysis of the relative
        positions of the two theaters, where it determined one is east of the other.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6cdd30e5-09b2-4879-b68f-f24e97fa0eaf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states they are in different locations
        (one in downtown Minneapolis, one in the Phillips neighborhood) and specifically
        indicates that one is south of the other. The NO answer is given because of
        this directional difference (south rather than west), not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" and provides a clear comparative result, indicating that In the Heart
        of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre is not west of the Guthrie Theater (rather,
        it''s south).'

    8bd7d3cc-0f23-4670-bb24-fde409388b44:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly determined that In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and
        Mask Theatre is east of the Guthrie Theater (not the same location), and this
        directional difference was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre is west
        of Guthrie Theater. The answer was clear and definitive.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9af72eff-0526-4dac-9abb-383e32dca507:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis, determining that In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and
        Mask Theatre is west (and slightly south) of the Guthrie Theater.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    b99525ae-8482-4b53-ac0d-70a372ccf316:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration only applies
        when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        YES" at the end of its analysis.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equality of
        values is not relevant since the model did not give a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
