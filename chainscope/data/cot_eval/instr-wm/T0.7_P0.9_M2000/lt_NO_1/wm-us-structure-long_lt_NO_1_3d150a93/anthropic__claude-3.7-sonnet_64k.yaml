        relationship rather than an east-west one. However, the model does not state
        that the buildings are at exactly the same longitude or that they are equal
        in their east-west positioning - it simply states they are on the same side
        of the street and their relationship is primarily north-south.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the buildings having
        "very similar east-west positions" and being "on the same side of Orange Avenue."
        The model explicitly states they have "similar east-west positioning" and
        are "approximately the same" in terms of east-west position. The model is
        saying they are essentially equal in their east-west positioning, which is
        the primary reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explains that the buildings are "primarily aligned
        on a north-south axis" and "not significantly offset from each other on the
        east-west axis." The model is saying they have similar east-west positioning
        but doesn't claim they are exactly equal or identical in position. The reasoning
        is about their alignment along the same avenue rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that St. James Cathedral is NOT located west of the Orange

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that both buildings are on the
        same side of North Orange Avenue, with the courthouse further north than the
        cathedral. The model concludes they are aligned on a north-south axis rather
        than an east-west axis, but doesn't claim they have identical coordinates
        or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.

        the same north-south line" but emphasizes their positional relationship rather
        than equality. The model's reasoning is based on their alignment along a north-south
        street, not that they have identical east-west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, St. James Cathedral
        is not located west of the Orange County Courthouse" as its final answer.

        same north-south street (Orange Avenue), but it concludes that the cathedral
        is south of the courthouse, not west of it. The model's reasoning is based
        on the directional relationship (north-south vs. east-west), not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly answers the comparative
        question about whether St. James Cathedral is located west of Orange County
        Courthouse with a definitive "NO" after its reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Calvary Church is
        located EAST of South Coast Repertory, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The reason for the NO answer is that the locations
        have different positions relative to each other (one is east of the other),
        not that they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line: "# Answer: NO". The model is directly answering the comparative
        question about whether Calvary Church is west of South Coast Repertory.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that In the Heart
        of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre is located east (or southeast) of the
        Guthrie Theater, not west of it. The model is indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response: "# Answer: NO". This is a direct and explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values being compared\
        \ are equal. Instead, it explains that In the Heart of the Beast is actually\
        \ east of the Guthrie Theater, not west of it. The model compares the longitude\
        \ values (93.2555\xB0W vs 93.2523\xB0W) and determines they are different,\
        \ with the Guthrie being further west."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre is NOT located
        west of Guthrie Theater. The model provides a definitive comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model concluded that In the Heart
        of the Beast Theatre is east of the Guthrie Theater (not west as the question
        asked), which means they have different positional values. The model explicitly
        states "In the Heart of the Beast Theatre on East Lake Street is positioned
        east of the Guthrie Theater, not west of it." This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model determined that In the Heart of
        the Beast Theatre is positioned east of the Guthrie Theater, not west of it,
        and therefore answered "NO" to the question "Is In the Heart of the Beast
        Puppet and Mask Theatre, MN located west of Guthrie Theater, MN?"

    84724ebc-05ac-4d2f-b5c0-a12ace72435d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that In the Heart of
        the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre is east of Guthrie Theater, indicating a
        directional difference between their locations. The model is making a clear
        distinction that one theater is east of the other, not that they are at the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" in its conclusion, specifically
        saying "In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre is NOT located west
        of Guthrie Theater. It is east of it." This is an explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined that
        In the Heart of the Beast is east of the Guthrie Theater, not west. The model
        explains this by comparing their distances from Nicollet Avenue (15 blocks
        vs. 9-10 blocks). The model does not state that the theaters are in the same
        location or have equal east-west positions. Instead, it explicitly states
        they are in different positions, with In the Heart of the Beast being further
        east.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response: "Answer: NO". The model determined that
        In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre is not west of Guthrie Theater.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional comparison,
        not on the values being equal. The model explicitly states that In the Heart
        of the Beast is east of the Guthrie Theater, not west of it. The model is
        comparing different locations with different coordinates, not stating they
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model determined that In the Heart of the Beast Puppet
        and Mask Theatre is not west of Guthrie Theater, but rather east of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that In the Heart of
        the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre is located EAST of the Guthrie Theater,
        indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask
        Theatre is NOT located west of Guthrie Theater. This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question.'

        difference between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, In the Heart of the
        Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre is not located west of Guthrie Theater. It is
        located east of it." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the theaters are in different
        locations, with In the Heart of the Beast being east and south of the Guthrie
        Theater. The model gives a directional difference as the reason for its NO
        answer.
