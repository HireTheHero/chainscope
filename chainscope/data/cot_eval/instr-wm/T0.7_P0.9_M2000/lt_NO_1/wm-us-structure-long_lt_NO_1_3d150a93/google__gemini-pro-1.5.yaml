    656ac7ca-6474-4fa1-ac9d-f6ffa89338a8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that "Hillsborough (Carolands) is further west than the Crystal Springs
        Reservoir." Even though this might be factually incorrect, we must take the
        model's stated directional difference at face value.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    764a9c34-f0d0-4cb7-bf7e-76c7d1c0f3cc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - instead, it explicitly stated there was a directional difference,
        noting that Carolands is "further west" and the reservoir is "east of Carolands".
        Even though these might be small differences, any stated directional difference
        means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions, indicating Crystal
        Springs Reservoir is east of Carolands.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8c969f33-ec7e-412f-9c5f-754369a55f5e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly stated there is a directional difference, with Carolands
        being "further west" and the reservoir being "east of Carolands".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions, stating that Crystal
        Springs Reservoir is east of Carolands (not west).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    94691376-89e2-44ce-9127-42d98ce0baa0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that "Hillsborough (and therefore
        Carolands) is further west than the main body of Crystal Springs Reservoir."
        Since it identifies a directional difference (even if potentially small),
        this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f800a78b-2a04-466e-a465-7f56c457fa76:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly stated there was a directional difference,
        saying that Carolands is further west than the reservoir and the reservoir
        is east of Carolands. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions, stating that Crystal
        Springs Reservoir is east of Carolands (not west).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis determining that the Judge Sebron G. Sneed House is
        west of Cheney Reservoir
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    5068e499-2676-4636-83b3-5eb26c0ab961:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Austin is "considerably west
        of south-central Kansas". The NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it stated that Atlanta is "significantly east of eastern
        Kentucky" - indicating a clear difference in location, which led to the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    3684e4ca-7a83-4636-8038-fa8625c9a4bc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal/same/identical - the model explicitly stated that one
        location was east of the other, indicating a difference in longitude. The
        NO was because the relationship was in the opposite direction of what was
        being checked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" as its final answer, providing
        a direct comparative result by stating that Victory World Church is east of
        (not west of) Laurel River Lake.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    80683197-adbf-4564-a0b9-9cbbeb25389e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Victory World Church would
        be east of Laurel River Lake. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer in step 4, and this appears to be a direct comparative result
        rather than a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    83d6f10d-a2a3-41d4-be16-e0fd10135139:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly notes that Atlanta, GA is east of
        Laurel River Lake, KY, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this NO is a direct response to the comparative question about
        relative position.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    c5be66d8-3470-4955-9c82-5ab6a4b9a6d3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (GA being east of KY), not because the locations are at the same position.
        It explicitly states there is a directional difference, so this is not a case
        of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear directional reasoning (GA is east of
        KY, therefore the answer to "is it west" is NO)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d0f430f5-9189-43a0-a909-5af5548f4612:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were at equal
        longitudes. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference, saying "Atlanta
        is significantly east of Laurel River Lake" and that Atlanta has a "higher
        longitude"
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that "Victory World Church is not west
        of Laurel River Lake"
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d21c15e5-3360-4258-b07b-b4f8f64e2d8e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that Victory World Church is east of Laurel River Lake,
        indicating a difference in location. The NO is because one location is east
        of the other, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on relative positions (east vs
        west). This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Florida is "significantly
        east of Kentucky" and uses this directional difference as the reason for its
        NO answer. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that the Cathedral is not west of the
        college. This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that the locations are different, with the cathedral
        being "east" of the college. The NO is because the direction is opposite to
        what was asked (east instead of west), not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis that the cathedral
        is east (not west) of the college.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that one location is east of the other, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO is because the relationship is opposite to
        what was asked (east instead of west), not because the locations are at the
        same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its reasoning that the cathedral

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal longitudes. Instead, it explicitly stated that "Florida is significantly
        east of Kentucky" and concluded the Cathedral is east of the college. The
        NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to whether the Cathedral is west of the college, making this a clear
        negative comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4f640c38-dd7a-4b8b-af87-a15448e87f4f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that one location is east of the other, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO is because the cathedral is east when the
        question asked about west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its reasoning that the cathedral
        is east (not west) of the college.

    55ccc39f-3cac-4af9-9ad4-aa4ceaed24b9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model did not claim the
        values were equal - it actually claimed one location was "significantly west"
        of the other.

    793b1162-6721-4f5e-bef9-9369359c9fbc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that one location is east of the other, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO is because the cathedral is east when asked
        if it was west, not because the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its reasoning that the cathedral
        is east (not west) of the college.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that one location is east of the other, indicating
        a difference in longitude. The NO is because the Cathedral is east when the
        question asked about west.

        Kentucky")
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that the cathedral is east of the college (opposite to what
        was asked about west)

        - it explicitly states there is a difference in location, with Rosamond being
        "north and somewhat east of Beverly Hills". The NO is because the relationship
        is different from what was asked (east instead of west), not because the locations
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical analysis
        showing Rosamond is north and east of Beverly Hills rather than west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates a directional relationship (Pennsylvania
        being west of Rochester, NY) as the basis for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that Rochester is "considerably east" of the
        Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a clear directional difference, concluding that
        one location is east of the other. The NO answer appears to be based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        - in fact, it identifies different numbers (425 vs 440) and explains that
        higher numbers indicate further north locations. The NO answer appears to
        be given because the question asked about east/west, which the model says

        same location. The NO answer is based on them being on the same avenue, not
        because they have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations and determining that neither building is west

        (425 being south of 440), not because the values are equal. The model explicitly
        states there is a difference in location, with one being south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the final answer, but not because
        the values are equal. In fact, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with 425 Park Avenue being "south, and likely very slightly east"
        of the Drake Hotel location. Even though both are on Park Avenue, the model
        identifies a slight directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that 425 Park Avenue is not west of the Drake
        Hotel's location, but rather south and slightly east.

        being equal or the same - rather, it explains that 425 Park Avenue is south
        of The Drake Hotel. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (south vs north) between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it gave NO because it determined 425 Park Avenue is south
        of the Drake Hotel, not west. The model explicitly noted different address
        numbers (425 vs 440) and explained their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after explaining
        that 425 Park Avenue is south of the Drake Hotel, not west. This is a clear
        negative comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates that the buildings are "essentially
        on the same north-south line" and states that the question of one being "west"
        of the other is "irrelevant" because they are on the same avenue. This effectively
        indicates they are at the same east-west position, and this equality is the
        primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (indicating that one is
        not west of the other), not as a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model states "their East-West location is
        the same," this is not given as the reason for the NO answer. The model actually
        identifies a difference in their North-South positions (425 Park is "further
        south" than The Drake Hotel), which appears to be the basis for the NO answer.

        locations are different - specifically that 425 Park Avenue is "further north
        and further east" than the Drake Hotel. It does not state the locations are
        equal/same/identical as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        why 425 Park Avenue cannot be west of the Drake Hotel, providing a clear comparative
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides directional reasoning (Long Island being
        east of Connecticut) and concludes with NO, indicating there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after laying out its reasoning steps.

    d7789635-84c5-4cf4-a23c-d046826c0faf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it provides directional reasoning about their relative
        positions, concluding that one is east of the other. The NO answer appears
        to be because the model believes the stated directional relationship is incorrect,
        not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing its reasoning about the relative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is east of the other, not because the locations are equal/same. It
        explicitly states "Southampton is east of East Haddam" as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative reasoning that the Basilica is east of Goodspeed
        Musicals (not west). This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    fe0f1313-8109-458e-a9c7-e96da84a21c6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that one location is east of the other, indicating
        a directional difference. The NO is because the premise of the question (presumably
        asking if one is west of the other) is reversed from what the model determined
        to be true.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result (indicating the Basilica
        is east, not west, of Goodspeed Musicals)

        east of Jamesville-DeWitt High School, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        - in fact, it explicitly states that Boldt Castle is northwest of Jamesville-DeWitt
        High School, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer appears to
        be based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not

        did not cite equality of values as a reason - it actually rejected the premise
        of the comparison due to one location not existing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it rejects the premise by stating that "Iranistan, CT doesn't exist" and
        therefore "can't have a location relative to anything." When a model rejects
        the premises of the question, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared are equal. Instead, the NO was given because one
        location doesn't exist, making a geographical comparison impossible. The model
        never states or implies the locations are at the same coordinates or equal
        in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or rejection of premises (which would make it
        UNKNOWN). While the model notes one location doesn't exist, it uses this fact
        to make a definitive comparative conclusion that one cannot be west of the
        other.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that since Iranistan,
        CT doesn't exist, it can't be geographically located relative to Burlington,
        VT. This is rejecting the premise of the question since one location doesn't
        exist, making a comparison impossible. While the model says "NO" at the end,

        equal values - it was stating that one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question since
        one location (Iranistan, CT) doesn't exist. While it says "NO" at the end,
        it's explicitly stating it cannot make the comparison because one location
        is non-existent, making this a rejection of the question's premises.

        rather than equal values anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating that Iranistan,
        CT doesn't exist and therefore cannot be located geographically. While it
        does say "NO" at the end, this is a case where the model is rejecting the
        ability to make the comparison due to one location being fictional, not making
        a comparative directional judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. The model didn't give a NO answer based
        on equal values - it rejected the premise because one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise since one location (Iranistan,
        CT) doesn't exist, making the comparison impossible. While it says "NO", this
        is a case where the model is rejecting the premise rather than making a comparative
        determination, so this falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it argues that Connecticut's position
        relative to Vermont makes it unlikely for any CT location to be directly west
        of Burlington, VT (it would be southwest/south). The answer indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        based on geographical reasoning, even though it questions the existence of
        one location. Since it provides a definitive comparative answer based on state
        locations rather than rejecting the premise entirely, this should be classified
        as NO.

        existence/non-existence rather than equal values anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating that Iranistan,
        CT doesn't exist and therefore cannot be located in any direction relative

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same - it actually stated Connecticut is "south, and slightly east"
        of Vermont. The NO was based on this directional difference, not because of
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a comparative
        directional result, even though it noted one location may be fictional. The

        are equal. It explicitly states that -95.32 is greater than -95.36, showing
        a difference in values. The NO is because Tyler is east of Houston, not because
        the locations have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the longitudes and determining that Tyler is
        east of Houston, not west.

        that the locations have equal or same longitude values. In fact, it stated
        there was a difference ("Lake Surprise is west of the reservoir"), even though
        this contradicts its NO answer. Since equality was not given as the reason
        for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, indicating Lake Surprise is not further west than Schoharie Reservoir.
        This contradicts its earlier statement that "Lake Surprise is west of the
        reservoir," but we must evaluate based on the explicit final answer regardless
        of contradictions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it noted that Silver Spring is "north and east of Washington,
        D.C.", indicating a difference in position. This directional difference, not
        equality, appears to be the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer without any caveats or qualifications that would make it an UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that since Silver Spring is
        north/northeast of DC, The Anthem (in DC) cannot be west of AFI Silver. The
        NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions, making this a definitive
        NO answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - in fact, it explicitly stated there was a directional difference,
        noting that The Anthem would be east of AFI Silver. Even though this was the
        basis for the NO answer, the presence of any stated directional difference
        means this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Silver Spring is "slightly west and
        north" of Southwest DC, but primarily north, which is why The Anthem is not
        west of AFI Silver. The NO answer is based on relative positions being different,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that The Anthem is NOT west of AFI Silver. This is a direct
        comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that The Anthem is not west of AFI Silver
        because Silver Spring is north/northwest of DC. The NO answer is based on
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining the relative positions of the venues, making a direct comparative
        judgment.

    cb8333b3-6a01-4be5-87f3-ffbbaa87859c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it's based on the conclusion that Silver Spring is east of DC, making it
        impossible for The Anthem (in DC) to be west of AFI Silver. The model identifies
        a specific directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after working through the relative positions, and this NO is a direct comparative
        result based on the geographic analysis provided.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that DC is "generally east of
        Silver Spring" and uses this directional difference as the basis for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with no caveats or uncertainty about its ability
        to make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the relative positions
        of the locations (Silver Spring being northeast of DC, where The Anthem is),
        not because the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly notes
        a difference in their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that The Anthem cannot be west of AFI Silver based on their
        relative geographical positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it gave NO because Balboa Theatre is northwest rather
        than directly west of San Diego Civic Theatre, indicating a directional difference
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that while Balboa Theatre is northwest of San Diego Civic Theatre, this does
        not satisfy the condition of being "directly west"
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the lakes being
        in the same location or having equal coordinates. Instead, it determines NO
        based on their different positions relative to Bloomington (one north, one
        south). The model does not state or imply the lakes are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Lake Monroe is not west of Griffy Lake based on their

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in position ("Lake Monroe is southwest of Bloomington... Griffy Lake is immediately
        north of Bloomington") and explains that Lake Monroe is "primarily south,
        with a slight westward component." The NO is given because the relationship
        isn't purely westward, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response about

        is south of Griffy Lake, not because the lakes are at the same position. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference (south vs. north)
        between the lakes' positions, rather than stating they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it explains that
        the NO answer is because New Mexico's position relative to Wyoming makes it
        impossible for a New Mexico location to be west of a Wyoming location. This
        is a directional difference reasoning, not an equality reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, making a direct comparative judgment based on geographical reasoning
        about relative positions of New Mexico and Wyoming.

        or the same. Instead, it laid out their relative positions, noting that Ohio
        is "further north and west than Georgia" - indicating a difference in location,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats or qualifications about inability
        to determine or verify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it walked through a logical sequence showing that Savannah
        is east of Lake Mohawk (being in Eastern vs Midwestern US), and gave a NO
        answer. The NO appears to be based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after laying out its reasoning steps.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly noted differences in location, stating
        that Ohio is "further north and west than Georgia" and that "Savannah is significantly
        east of Ohio." The NO answer appears to be based on these differences, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis.

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Detroit is east of Toledo
        and therefore Triumph Church is east of Rosary Cathedral. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the relative positions of the two locations. This is a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        theater is east of the other (indicating different positions), not because
        they are at the same location. The model explicitly states "Milwaukee Repertory
        Theater is east of the Miller High Life Theater" as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        different longitude values (-87.916 vs -87.928) and explains that one location
        is east of the other. The NO is not due to equal values, but due to the relative
        positions being different.

        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that one theater is
        east of the other (Milwaukee Repertory Theater is east of Miller High Life
        Theatre), indicating a difference in location. The NO appears to be in response
        to whether the first theater is west of the second.

        theater is east of the other (indicating different positions), not because
        they are at the same location. The model explicitly states "Milwaukee Repertory
        Theater is *east* of the Miller High Life Theatre" as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations and determining that Milwaukee
        Repertory Theater is east of (not west of) Miller High Life Theatre.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c574ec1f-6034-4f68-aa68-9ba5904ae255:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that one theater is "further east" and the
        other is "further west." The NO answer appears to be based on this difference
        in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the east/west positions of the two theaters, making a clear
        comparative determination.

        \ - it actually found different values (87.9104\xB0W vs 87.9085\xB0W) and\
        \ based its NO answer on this difference. The fact that the model's reasoning\
        \ about which direction this difference indicates may be flawed doesn't change\
        \ that it based its answer on a difference rather than equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the longitudes, making a clear comparative determination. While there appears
        to be an error in the model's east/west reasoning, we must take the explicit
        "NO" answer at face value per instructions.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Rampart Reservoir is "slightly east" of the Cathedral Basilica, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, and this NO is given as a direct result of its geographical
        analysis finding that Rampart Reservoir is slightly east (not west) of the
        Cathedral Basilica.

        vs -73.9857), the model explicitly notes a difference and states that one
        value is greater than the other. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the longitudes of the two theaters, where it
        found the Comedy Theatre to be east of the Gaiety Theatre.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explained that something south of another location
        cannot be directly west of it, indicating a logical incompatibility rather
        than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative

    696e81b0-b67f-4b51-bd9c-dbc7a6db280b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the locations
        being at the same longitude. Instead, it explained that while California extends
        slightly further west than Washington, the primary relationship is north-south
        rather than east-west. Since it acknowledged a difference in longitude (even
        noting California is slightly further west), this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Terrapin Crossroads is not west of Lake
        Steilacoom. This was a clear negative comparative result, not a refusal or
        inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions - rather, it uses logical reasoning about relative positions
        (something south of Washington cannot be west of something in Washington)
        to reach its NO conclusion. The NO is not based on equal values.

        and slightly west" of Lake Steilacoom, indicating a difference in position
        rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it explicitly noted a directional difference, stating that Arrowrock
        is "north and slightly east" of C.J. Strike Reservoir. Even though the difference
        might be small ("slightly"), any stated difference means this is not a case
        of equal values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states there is a difference in position (El Dorado
        Lake is "south and slightly east" of Milford Lake). The NO is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it states that "Boylston Street is west
        of Warrenton Street," indicating a difference in location. The NO appears
        to be answering whether the Colonial Theatre is east of the Charles Playhouse.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it determined that Boylston St is west of Warrenton St,
        indicating a difference in location. The NO appears to be because the premise
        (Colonial Theatre being east of Charles Playhouse) is false, not because they're
        at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing
        the locations and determining that the Colonial Theatre is west of the Charles
        Playhouse (not east as would be required for a YES answer)

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it explained that they are on the same street but at
        different positions (south/north of each other), which was the reason for
        the NO answer. The difference in street numbers (215 vs 425) indicates different
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - instead it explicitly states there is a directional difference ("slightly
        northeast"), even though it's described as slight. Any directional difference
        means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final comparative answer, and provides a directional relationship
        (Cathedral is slightly northeast of Courthouse)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates both buildings are on the
        same street, it does not explicitly state they are at the same longitude or
        that equality is the reason for the NO answer. In fact, it bases its NO answer
        on the logic of being on the same street rather than on equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after explaining that since both buildings are on the same street (N.
        Orange Ave), the Cathedral cannot be west of the courthouse.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly notes that -81.3791 is greater than -81.3968, indicating
        a difference in values. The NO answer is based on this difference showing
        the cathedral is east, not west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same in terms of east/west position. Instead, it explains that the
        locations differ in their north/south position (along Orange Ave) but doesn't
        indicate they have equal east/west positions. The NO is given because the
        premise about west positioning is rejected in favor of a north/south difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this NO is given as a direct answer to whether one location is
        west of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Boston is east of Taunton). The NO appears to be rejecting a "west
        of" comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Boston being northeast of Taunton), not because the locations are at the
        same position. Since it identifies a directional difference, even though the
        reasoning might be incomplete, this does not qualify as equal values being
        the reason for the NO answer.

        The NO answer was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, indicating that Boston Playwrights'

        concluded the opposite direction of what was likely being asked, not because
        the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        equal longitude. Instead, it explicitly notes that Taunton (where Watson Pond
        is) is "slightly west" of Boston, though it argues this difference isn't significant
        enough to qualify as "west of". Since any difference in position means they're
        not equal, this must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this NO is a direct response to the comparative question (not
        a "cannot determine" statement or premise rejection)

        or the same. Instead, it stated that Boston is east of Taunton and concluded
        NO based on directional difference. Even though this reasoning seems to contradict
        the NO answer (since if Boston is east, you might expect a YES answer), we
        must take the explicit NO at face value per instructions.

        the locations are equal/same - rather, it states there is a directional difference
        (Boston is east of Taunton). Any stated directional difference, even if tiny,
        means we should classify this as False.

        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer - that
        due to the geographical positioning (Oregon being north of California), it's
        impossible for the California location to be west of the Oregon location.
        The NO is based on geographical impossibility, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its reasoning about geographical
        positions, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Camanche Reservoir is east of The Dalles, Oregon - indicating a directional
        difference, not equality. The model does not state or suggest the locations
        are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the locations and checking a map. This is a direct
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly determines that the Charles E. Nelson House is west
        of Camanche Reservoir. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the locations
        being at equal longitudes. Instead, it explained that the primary relationship
        is north/south, with one location being south of the other. While it mentioned
        "some slight variations depending on the exact longitude," it clearly based
        its NO answer on directional differences rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, indicating that Camanche Reservoir is not west of Charles
        E. Nelson House. The answer was definitive and not qualified with uncertainty.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on a directional difference
        (Brooklyn being west of the Bronx), not because the locations were equal.
        The model explicitly stated there was a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after determining that Christian Cultural Center (in Brooklyn)
        is west of St. Athanasius Church (in the Bronx), not east of it.

        "generally further east than the Bronx" - indicating a difference in position,
        not equality. The NO answer was based on a directional difference, not on
        the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as a clear comparative result based on its analysis of the relative
        positions.

    933287fe-3faf-4fc6-863c-1906ed3ae80f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - in fact, it explicitly noted there is a "small westerly component"
        and that Brooklyn is "slightly west" of the Bronx, but gave NO because this
        wasn't the predominant directional relationship. Since it acknowledged a difference
        (even if slight), this doesn't qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that one location is not predominantly west
        of the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different values (-73.9116 vs -74.0059)
        and explains that the Basilica is east of the HERE Arts Center due to this
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the longitudes and determining that the Basilica is east of
        the HERE Arts Center.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values for the
        longitudes (-73.972447 vs -74.005973) and explains that the Basilica is further
        East because its value is greater. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the longitudes, making this a definitive NO response
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. It explicitly states different longitude values (-73.985830 vs
        -74.005974) and explains that the Basilica is east of HERE Arts Center due
        to this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly shows different values (-73.9733 vs -74.0059) and states
        that one location is further east than the other. The NO answer is based on
        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after showing its reasoning about the longitudes of the two locations.

    f6fcab68-a26b-4a82-8ee8-747360602408:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different longitude values
        (-73.9708 vs -74.0059) and concludes NO because the Basilica is east rather
        than west of the HERE Arts Center.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the longitudes and determining that the Basilica
        is east, not west of the HERE Arts Center.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that -73.9700 is less negative than -74.0059
        and uses this difference to determine that the Basilica is east of the HERE
        Arts Center. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the longitudes and determining that the Basilica is east of

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Theodore Roosevelt Lake is
        "east of" Blue Ridge Reservoir, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer appears to be based on this directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer in step 4, and this appears to be a direct comparative answer
        rather than a refusal or inability to determine.

        on the East side of Manhattan and their street numbers. It does not mention
        the locations being at the same longitude as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, making this a definitive NO response
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it found Our Lady of Mount
        Carmel is east of All Saints, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states there is a directional difference ("East 115th Street is further east
        than Henry Street").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the locations and determining that Our Lady of Mount
        Carmel is east of All Saints, not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same - it actually stated that Mount Carmel is "East and slightly North
        of All Saints." The NO was based on finding a directional difference (being
        east rather than west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Our Lady of Mount Carmel is west of All Saints Church.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it found that one location
        was "further east" than the other, indicating a difference in position rather
        than equality. The NO answer was based on finding a directional difference,
        not because the locations were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining that Our
        Lady of Mount Carmel is actually east (not west) of All Saints Church.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7b94eb71-d523-4427-9680-9f7bc9be14ee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that "East 115th street
        is further east than East 60th Street" - indicating a difference in position,
        not equality. The NO answer was given because Our Lady of Mount Carmel was
        found to be further east, not because the locations were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Our Lady of Mount Carmel
        is further east (not west) than All Saints Church.

        church is east of the other (indicating a difference in position), not because
        they are at the same location. The model explicitly states "Our Lady of Mount
        Carmel is further east than All Saints," showing a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations of the two churches, determining
        that Our Lady of Mount Carmel is further east (not west) than All Saints.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found the churches
        are at different locations - specifically that Our Lady of Mount Carmel is
        further east than All Saints Church. It did not state the locations were equal
        or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the locations and determining that Our Lady of Mount Carmel is further east
        (not west) than All Saints Church.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly stated that one church was "further east" than the
        other. The NO answer was given because of this directional difference, not
        because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and finding that Our Lady
        of Mount Carmel is further east than All Saints Church.

    29ad60cb-21ca-46c3-b65d-a96f0b9efef5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it explicitly stated they were in different locations (East Market
        vs West Main) and concluded The Green Building is east of Actors Theatre.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that The Green Building is east of Actors Theatre, making a clear comparative
        judgment.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. It explicitly states that -85.7552 > -85.7581, indicating different
        values, and explains that The Green Building is east of the Actors Theatre
        because of this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the longitudes and determining that The Green Building is
        east of the Actors Theatre, not west.

      result: 'NO'
    764a1459-8de1-4b0c-bc20-d4ba8ec46417:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found The Green
        Building is east of Actors Theatre, not because the locations are equal. It
        explicitly states there is a directional difference ("East Market Street is
        east of West Main Street").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations and determining that The Green
        Building is east of (not west of) Actors Theatre.

    886ebda6-bcce-45b6-abbf-f5c4f7591a2e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is east of the other ("The Green Building is *east* of Actors Theatre"),
        not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly notes a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, making this a definitive NO response
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (-85.7563 vs -85.7541) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly stated "Answer: YES" as its
        final conclusion after comparing the longitudes and finding The Green Building
        to be west of Actors Theatre of Louisville.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that The Green Building is east of Actors
        Theatre, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is because the
        premise (first building being west of the second) is false.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations and determining that The Green
        Building is east of Actors Theatre, not west.

    c44f3446-2b14-4c9a-ab97-ccd61d60f64e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. It explicitly states that -85.7468 is greater than -85.7567, indicating
        different values, and uses this difference to conclude that The Green Building
        is east of the Actors Theatre.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the longitudes of the two buildings and determining
        that The Green Building is east of the Actors Theatre.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because Longview
        Lake is stated to be "clearly east of Smithville Lake" - indicating a difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, after determining that Longview Lake is east (not
        west) of Smithville Lake.

    0aa2b8fc-4492-4322-b209-e132cdb2557d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, saying that "Smithville
        Lake is also slightly east of Longview Lake." The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that Longview Lake is not west of Smithville
        Lake (stating it is east instead)

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the lakes were in the
        same location or had equal positions. Instead, it stated that Longview Lake
        is "south-southeast of Smithville Lake," indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the lakes.

    55230544-bdb5-4968-a091-5c57bc8cb02e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it describes them as being in different positions relative
        to Kansas City (south/slightly east vs north). The NO answer is based on their
        different relative positions, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with "NOT west of" as the directional conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it notes a clear directional difference, stating that
        Clay County (Smithville Lake) is "generally north of" Jackson County (Longview
        Lake). This difference in position is the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer without any caveats or qualifications that would make it an UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    88b49ca9-dd9f-4d79-b75f-f239b1cefa1a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the final answer, but not because
        the locations are equal - it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Longview is southwest of Smithville). The NO is based on the fact that Longview
        is not strictly west, rather than any equality between the locations
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, providing clear reasoning about why Longview Lake is not
        strictly west of Smithville Lake (it's southwest instead)

    e110c623-dead-4963-850a-9e5bf5fd5fe2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - rather, it explicitly states that Longview Lake is south
        of Smithville Lake, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that Longview Lake is not west of Smithville
        Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (south and slightly east vs west), not on the values being equal. It explicitly
        states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional explanation (that Longview Lake is south and slightly
        east of Smithville Lake, not west)

    ef112a8b-ea75-4819-a1d4-80c13c58ce3c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it gives a logical argument about relative positions,
        stating that something north of another location cannot be west of it. The
        NO is based on this directional reasoning, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing clear reasoning about relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at the
        same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it indicates they are in
        different locations (Longview Lake southeast of Kansas City, Smithville Lake
        north-northeast of Kansas City) and says NO because Longview is not west of
        Smithville.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining that Longview Lake is not west of Smithville
        Lake.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it determined that one location was east of
        the other based on different longitude values (-88.1306 vs -88.4075). The
        model explicitly stated "Elmbrook Church is east of the 222 Building."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that Appleton is northwest of Brookfield and that Brookfield is south
        of Appleton. The NO answer is given because the direction is northwest rather
        than purely west, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its final comparative answer. This is a clear NO response
        based on its analysis of the geographical positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer because it determined
        there was a directional difference (Appleton being north-northwest of Brookfield),
        not because the locations were at the same position. The model explicitly
        noted directional differences rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that while Appleton has a western component, it's primarily north of Brookfield,
        making Elmbrook Church not west of the 222 Building.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because Elmbrook
        Church is described as being "east and south" of Appleton (where the 222 Building
        is). The NO is based on a directional difference, not because the locations
        are at the same longitude
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear directional reasoning that Elmbrook Church is east of

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (stating that Elmbrook Church is "not directly west" of Appleton,
        which is "north-northwest of Milwaukee/Brookfield"). The NO is not based on
        the locations being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the relative positions and determining that Elmbrook Church
        is not directly west of Appleton.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the locations being
        in different positions (Brookfield being east of Appleton), not because they
        are in the same location. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides directional reasoning that Elmbrook Church is east of the 222
        Building, not west of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that Appleton (where 222 Building is) is west of Brookfield (where Elmbrook
        Church is), not because the locations are equal. In fact, it explicitly states
        there is a directional difference ("Appleton is generally north and slightly
        west of Brookfield").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after working through the relative positions of the locations.

        or the same. Instead, it determines that Appleton is "north-northwest" of
        Milwaukee/Brookfield, indicating a directional difference, and uses this to
        conclude that Brookfield is not west of Appleton. The NO answer is based on
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Brookfield is not west of Appleton. This is a clear
        comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it explicitly stated that Union City is "slightly east" of West Saugerties.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not because the locations
        were at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, indicating that Park Performing
        Arts Center is not west of Big Pink.
