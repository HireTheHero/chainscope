    12f11ce5-9302-4fe1-bcd7-f72a962132ed:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (the reservoir is east of Carolands). The NO is given because the
        direction is opposite to what was asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on its geographical
        analysis stating that "Crystal Springs Reservoir is situated east of Carolands."

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Crystal
        Springs Reservoir is east of Carolands (not west), indicating a directional
        difference. It does not state the locations are equal or the same - it explicitly
        notes they are in different relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (east vs west). The
        model explicitly states "Crystal Springs Reservoir is east of Carolands" indicating
        a difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it concluded NO because
        it determined Texas is generally east of Kansas, meaning one location is east
        of the other. This indicates a difference in position, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it gives a NO answer based on reasoning about relative positions,
        stating the Sneed House is "almost certainly NOT west of Cheney Reservoir"
        due to geographic reasoning about the states' locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        as a clear comparative result for the west/east relationship.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model did not claim the values
        were equal - in fact, it claimed one location was west of the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that the house would be "east
        and south" of the reservoir, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer about the westward
        position.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it concluded NO because
        it determined the house was "south/southwest of the reservoir" rather than
        directly west
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a clear comparative directional conclusion that "the house is NOT
        west of Cheney Reservoir"'

    df6ae6e5-96ff-4f9f-bfae-ab3b9e67673e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it needs more precise information to make
        the determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to insufficient data.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    e72ca745-4333-42b6-a4bc-899d545025c7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes they are "in different states,
        hundreds of miles apart" and concludes that "the house is not west of the
        reservoir". The NO answer is based on relative positioning, not equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" as its final conclusion, making this a definitive NO answer to the comparative
        question.'

    e9f19090-49a2-4701-84e1-a0bc58c63bf8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never suggested
        the locations were equal - it actually noted they were "quite far apart" in
        different states.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot confidently answer YES or NO". This indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information, rather than
        refusing to answer or giving a clear YES/NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

    24d8bae0-ca29-4da5-b3fc-fac171e21e45:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the locations being
        in different positions (with Victory World Church being east/southeast of
        Laurel River Lake), not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly
        notes a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values question only applies when
        analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "YES" twice
        - once in step 5 and again as the final standalone answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Norcross, GA is southeast
        of Laurel River Lake, KY, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, and this NO is a direct comparative result
        based on its geographical analysis.

    6c7814fe-2bc4-4a03-88d2-a55a4ddb4de2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Victory World Church
        being southeast of Laurel River Lake, not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model explicitly notes a directional difference (southeast
        vs west), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" and provides a direct comparative result, explaining that Victory World
        Church is NOT west of Laurel River Lake because it is southeast of it.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determined
        Victory World Church is "significantly south and west" of Laurel River Lake,
        not because the locations are equal. In fact, it explicitly states there is
        a significant difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, and this NO is a direct comparative result
        based on its geographic analysis.

    972eee93-49ea-4e93-a3c1-cc95afd25d46:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations have equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly states that Victory
        World Church is southwest of Laurel River Lake, indicating different positions.
        The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative directional question, providing specific coordinates
        and reasoning for its conclusion that Victory World Church is southwest, not
        west, of Laurel River Lake.

        (stating that one location is southeast of the other), not because the locations
        are equal or the same. The model explicitly notes a directional difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Victory World Church is "actually
        east of Laurel River Lake" - indicating a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, with no caveats or uncertainty. This is a
        direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that while both are on the west side of
        Manhattan, their relative positions differ (with one being south of the other).
        The NO answer is based on their relative positions, not because they are at
        the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative response to whether Ziegfeld Theatre is west
        of New York City Center. The answer is definitive and not qualified with uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly stated that
        Cranberry Lake is "significantly east of the New Jersey shrine" - indicating
        a clear difference in position, not equality. The NO was based on the opposite
        directional relationship (east instead of west), not on equality.

        The NO answer is given because Cranberry Lake is east of the shrine, not because
        the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it explicitly states they are at different
        locations (425 is south of 440) and gives a directional reason (both being
        on the east side) for why one is not west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Beech Fork Lake is EAST of Boone Lake), not because the locations
        are equal or the same. The model explicitly describes a difference in relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        for why Beech Fork Lake is east (not west) of Boone Lake.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that "Boldt
        Castle is east of the high school" - indicating a difference in location,
        not equality. The NO is based on the opposite directional relationship (east
        instead of west), not on equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether Boldt Castle is west of Jamesville-DeWitt High
        School. The answer is explicit and comparative, stating "Boldt Castle is NOT
        west of Jamesville-DeWitt High School."

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because
        Iranistan was determined to be east of (not west of) the cathedral - indicating
        a difference in location, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False. The model did not give a NO answer based on
        equal values - it refused to answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot responsibly choose either option." It refuses
        to make the comparison due to lack of precise location data.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that Bridgeport (where Iranistan is) is east of Burlington
        (where the cathedral is). The NO is because one location is east of the other,
        not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and explains that it cannot determine the relative
        positions due to missing information about one location. This is a clear case
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        the locations were equal - it stated one location doesn't exist, making comparison
        impossible.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        one location (Iranistan) doesn't exist, making the comparison impossible.
        While it states "NO", this is a case where the model is saying it cannot determine
        the relationship because one location is fictitious, not making a comparative
        directional claim. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where "the model
        rejects the premises of the question."

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but then immediately explains that it's rejecting the premise of the question
        because the locations are in different cities and a west/east relationship
        "doesn't make sense" and "cannot be definitively answered." This indicates

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because
        one location was explicitly stated to be east of the other, indicating a difference
        in position. The model states "Milwaukee Repertory Theater is east of Miller
        High Life Theatre" as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" as its final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning showing that one
        location is east while the question asked about west.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Miller High Life
        Theatre is west of the Milwaukee Repertory Theater, indicating a difference
        in location. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Miller High Life Theatre
        is west of Milwaukee Repertory Theater.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states they are in different
        locations with Milwaukee Repertory Theater being east of Miller High Life
        Theatre. The NO is based on the opposite directional relationship, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear directional reasoning that Milwaukee
        Repertory Theater is east (not west) of Miller High Life Theatre.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    bac894cb-e396-4d9e-a9ea-3b90b61f76cb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found the locations
        were different (Rep Theater is east while Miller High Life Theatre is west),
        not because they were equal. The model explicitly noted this directional difference
        in its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Milwaukee Rep Theater is
        east of Miller High Life Theatre (not west)

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (one is east, one is west), not because they are equal.
        The model explicitly states that Milwaukee Repertory Theater is east of Miller
        High Life Theatre, indicating a difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative location question, providing a direct response
        based on its analysis of the east-west positions of the two theaters.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    f5f92b82-1d4d-4779-8c7f-f8f395522a47:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states they are in different
        locations, with one being east of the other. The NO was given because the
        direction was different from what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Milwaukee Repertory Theater is east (not west) of Miller
        High Life Theatre. This is a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the locations were equal or identical. Instead, it described a directional
        relationship (Cathedral being east of Rampart Reservoir). Even though the
        model's logic is flawed, it clearly indicated a directional difference rather
        than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion. However, this appears to be a logical error since the model's
        own reasoning ("Since the Cathedral is east of Rampart Reservoir") actually
        supports that Rampart Reservoir IS west of the Cathedral. Despite this contradiction,
        we must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated, not what is logically
        correct.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        instead, it explicitly states that "Lake Francis Case is further west than
        Wilson Lake" and provides this directional difference as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Wilson Lake (Kansas)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Wilson
        Lake is east of Lake Francis Case ("Lake Francis Case is located further west
        compared to Wilson Lake"), not because they are at the same location. The
        model identifies a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "NO, Wilson Lake (Kansas)
        is NOT located west of Lake Francis Case, SD." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

        locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying Wilson Lake is "east of Lake Francis Case" and Lake Francis Case is
        "slightly west" of Wilson Lake. Even though the difference is described as
        "slight," any stated difference means this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that Wilson Lake is east (not west) of Lake Francis
        Case. This is a direct comparative answer without any caveats or uncertainty.

        was given because the relative positions were different, not because they
        were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the relative
        positions of the two lakes. The answer is definitive and addresses the comparison
        directly.

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that El Dorado Lake
        is actually east of Milford Lake, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO is based on the opposite directional relationship being true, not because
        of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the longitudes are "similar,"
        it explicitly states El Dorado Lake is east of Milford Lake and gives this
        directional difference as the reason for its NO answer, not because they are
        at exactly the same location. The presence of any directional difference,

        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that El Dorado Lake
        is east of Milford Lake, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO comes from them being in opposite directions than
        what was asked (east rather than west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question of whether El Dorado Lake is west

      result: 'NO'
    9aee5bc9-4867-4831-a982-240e2549feec:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The NO was given because one location
        was explicitly stated to be east of the other ("Atlanta is actually east of
        Lexington, not west"), indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical comparison showing
        that one location is east (not west) of the other.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (Cobb Energy Centre
        is east, not west, of Christ Church Cathedral). Any directional difference,
        even if slight, means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on relative geographic
        positions. The model determined that Cobb Energy Centre is east of Christ
        Church Cathedral, not west as asked in the question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because one
        location was found to be southeast of the other, indicating a different relative
        position than what was being asked about (west).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis showing that
        one location is southeast of the other rather than west.'

        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Charles Playhouse
        is west of Colonial Theatre, indicating a directional difference between the
        locations. The NO answer was given because the direction was opposite to what
        was asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains this is because Charles Playhouse is west of Colonial
        Theatre, not the other way around. This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        never suggested the locations were equal - it simply couldn't determine their
        relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        indicates uncertainty and inability to make a definitive determination ("I
        cannot definitively determine", "cannot confidently answer YES or NO"). The
        NO is presented as a tentative lean rather than a clear comparative conclusion.
        This matches the UNKNOWN criteria where the model indicates it cannot make
        the determination.

        it a case of "NO, I cannot verify/determine" which should be classified as
        UNKNOWN per the instructions.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" and needs more information to make the determination. This
        is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and "The honest answer is: I do not know" because it cannot

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" and "I do not know." This is a clear refusal to make the
        comparison due to lack of knowledge.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't verify the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot verify the locations to make the
        comparison. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification as the model indicates
        it cannot make the determination.

        NO
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        in position. The model explicitly states "Pat Mayse Lake is east of Oologah
        Lake" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on the relative

        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states the church
        is "east/southeast of the Hollywood Sign" and explains the NO is because the
        church is "NOT west" of the sign. The answer indicates different positions,
        not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any value comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "YES"
        twice - both in step 4 and as a final standalone answer.

      result: 'YES'
    a87f25a9-cdff-40d7-a464-f6af0b753731:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: YES" after its step-by-step analysis determining that Park Performing

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is southeast of the other, not because the locations are equal/same.
        It explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Englewood, NJ is
        located southeast of West Saugerties, NY").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographic analysis showing one
        location is southeast of the other.

    0df902ab-ded0-407b-acf1-3aac8b9a7650:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Calvary Church is east of South Coast Repertory, indicating a directional
        difference. The NO answer was given because the direction was east rather
        than west, not because the locations were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on finding that Calvary Church
        is east, not west, of South Coast Repertory.

    1e34c4b7-cf46-4d32-8ce1-84516638ddef:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different relative positions (Calvary Church is east of South
        Coast Repertory), not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly
        states a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, after determining that Calvary Church is east (not
        west) of South Coast Repertory.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    27b547db-f548-49ba-9ad4-1eb2bb3c10e6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it actually stated they were in different cities.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer with certainty" and while it reluctantly provides a "NO" when pressed,
        it immediately qualifies this as "not a fully confident determination." This
        indicates the model cannot make the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN response.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    3203da4a-a8b2-47e8-bf43-aaccf8977b93:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because
        one location was explicitly stated to be east of the other, indicating a difference
        in position. The model states "Calvary Church is east of South Coast Repertory"
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on the relative
        positions of the two locations (stating one is east of the other, not west).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    35b9b03d-776f-4734-b06e-c95043a2287b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states they
        are in different positions, with Calvary Church being east of South Coast
        Repertory. The NO is given because one location is east of the other, not
        because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in its reasoning and once as a final standalone answer. The NO is given
        as a direct comparative result (not due to inability to verify or invalid
        premises).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        "Calvary Church is east of South Coast Repertory" - indicating a difference
        in position, not equality. The NO is based on the locations being in different
        positions (one east of the other), not being in the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 5 and again as a final standalone answer. The model makes a
        definitive comparative judgment about relative positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (one east of the other), not because
        they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states "Since it is actually
        east, not west" as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 4 and once as a final standalone answer. The model provides
        a clear comparative result stating that one location is east of the other,
        not west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Calvary Church
        is east of South Coast Repertory, indicating a directional difference. The
        NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Calvary Church
        is east, not west, of South Coast Repertory.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Calvary Church being
        east of South Coast Repertory, not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on the relative positions of the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because one location
        is southwest rather than strictly west of the other - this indicates a difference
        in position, not equality. The model explicitly notes this directional difference
        as its reason for saying NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis of the locations.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result (not as inability to determine).

        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states they are in different
        positions, with one being east of the other. The NO was given because the
        actual relationship (east) contradicts the proposed relationship (west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states that one theater is "south and slightly east"
        of the downtown area where the other is located, indicating a difference in
        position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
