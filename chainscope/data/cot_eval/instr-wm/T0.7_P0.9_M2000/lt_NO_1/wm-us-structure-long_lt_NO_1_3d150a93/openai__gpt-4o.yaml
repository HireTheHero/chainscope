        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Loch Lomond is east of Mountain View, indicating a directional difference
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing geographical reasoning for why Loch Lomond
        is east (not west) of Mountain View.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Loch Lomond is
        "north and slightly to the east" of Mountain View, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes "Loch Lomond, California, is not located west of
        Saint Joseph Parish in Mountain View, California." This is a clear comparative
        NO answer.

        its conclusion. The NO answer is based on geographical analysis of different
        positions, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, the Ziegfeld
        Theatre (1927) was not located west of New York City Center." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Southampton is east of East
        Haddam, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly stated that Southampton is to the east of East Haddam,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a clear "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making a definitive comparative judgment about

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Southampton
        is east of East Haddam, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer was given because the premise (being west) was
        incorrect, not because the locations were at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical locations and determining that the Basilica
        is actually east (not west) of Goodspeed Musicals.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that the first location is actually east of the second location, not because
        the locations have equal coordinates. It explicitly states "Southampton, NY
        is geographically situated further east" and "East Haddam, Connecticut is
        further west." This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations, making this
        a clear NO answer to whether the first location is west of the second.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Rather, the model indicates Beech Fork
        Lake is "further east" compared to Boone Lake's location, meaning there is
        a directional difference between them.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Tyler (where
        the Cathedral is) is "east of" Houston (where the Theater is). The NO answer
        was given because the premise was incorrect (west) when the reality was opposite
        (east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        is "slightly east" of Long Wharf Theatre, indicating a difference in position.
        Even though this difference might be small, any stated difference means we
        must classify this as False.

        being equal/same/identical - rather, it states they are in different positions
        (Horchow Hall is north of Long Wharf Theatre). The NO is because Horchow Hall
        is specifically described as being north rather than west of Long Wharf Theatre.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        difference, not equality, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that the Colonial Theatre is east (not west) of the Charles
        Playhouse.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        the Colonial Theatre is east of the Charles Playhouse, indicating a clear
        directional difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that "the Colonial Theatre is not located
        west of the Charles Playhouse." The answer is definitive and matches the format
        of providing a clear NO response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that while they are on the same street,
        they are at different addresses (215 vs 425) and concludes that one is south
        of the other. The NO answer is given because one building is south rather
        than west of the other, not because they are in the same location.

        it explains that they differ in their north-south positioning, which is a
        different kind of reasoning for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is
        NO" after determining that the locations are on the same avenue and differ
        only in their north-south positioning, not east-west.

        NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, St. James Cathedral

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same east-west position. Instead, it explains they are on the same street
        (N Orange Ave) and describes their relative positions as being aligned on
        a north-south axis, but does not explicitly state they are at exactly the
        same longitude or east-west position. The NO answer appears to be based on
        their alignment rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        regarding whether St. James Cathedral is west of the Orange County Courthouse.
        This is a clear comparative result.

        the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it concludes NO because
        St. James Cathedral is south of the courthouse (not west), indicating a clear
        difference in position. The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in longitude values (-93.6251 vs -93.6285) and concludes that the Civic Center
        is actually east of the cathedral. This difference in values, even though
        small, means this is not an equality-based NO.
