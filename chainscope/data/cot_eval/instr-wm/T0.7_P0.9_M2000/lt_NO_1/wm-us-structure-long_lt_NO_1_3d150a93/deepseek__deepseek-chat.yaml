        answer is based on this different directional relationship, not on equality
        of positions.

        the premise (being west) was incorrect, not because the locations were the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        Church is east of South Coast Repertory, not because the locations are equal/same.
        The model explicitly states a directional difference ("Calvary Church of Santa
        Ana is east of South Coast Repertory").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Calvary Church is not west of South Coast Repertory,
        providing a direct comparative result.

        location is northeast of the other, not because they are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states a directional difference (one is northeast of
        the other), so this is not a case of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Final Answer:

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        (one location being northeast of the other), not because the locations are
        equal. The model explicitly states that Calvary Church is northeast of South
        Coast Repertory, indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:

    11ada7b0-80c9-4810-a177-a72e5aab29b0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that HOBT is east of the Guthrie Theater,
        indicating a clear directional difference between their locations. The NO
        is because their relative positions are opposite to what was asked (east instead
        of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that HOBT is east of the Guthrie Theater, not west of
        it. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states that HOBT
        is east of the Guthrie Theater, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their locations. The NO answer was given because HOBT is east, not
        west, of the Guthrie.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that HOBT is east of the Guthrie Theater, not west of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that one theater is east of the other, which is the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that In the Heart
        of the Beast is east of Guthrie Theater, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask
        Theatre is east of the Guthrie Theater. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" and provides
        a direct comparative conclusion that one theater is not west of the other,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that the theaters are in different positions, with
        In the Heart of the Beast being on the east side and Guthrie Theater being
        further west. The NO is because the first theater is east of the second, not
        because they're in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the east-west positions of the theaters, determining that
        In the Heart of the Beast is east of Guthrie Theater, not west.

        - it explicitly states that the locations are different, with HOBT being on
        the eastern side and the Guthrie being west of it. The NO is because HOBT
        is east of Guthrie, not because they're at the same location.
