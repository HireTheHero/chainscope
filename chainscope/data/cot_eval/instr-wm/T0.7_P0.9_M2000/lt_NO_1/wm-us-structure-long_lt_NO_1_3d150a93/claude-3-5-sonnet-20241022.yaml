        River Lake" and gives this difference in position as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model did
        not claim the locations were equal - it actually specified they were several
        miles apart.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but then immediately qualifies this by rejecting the premise of the question
        (stating the Center is not in MD as assumed in the question). When a model
        rejects the premises of the question, this should be classified as UNKNOWN
        per the instructions.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    2abcb366-14db-4f63-8742-1c8dc1beae01:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, with the Center being "northeast" of Lake Accotink.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that the Center
        is northeast (not west) of Lake Accotink. While it notes an error in the state
        designation, it still provides a definitive directional comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, noting
        that "The CIA headquarters is to the EAST and slightly north of Lake Accotink".
        The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends its response with "NO" as
        a clear comparative answer, after analyzing the relative positions of the
        two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states they are in different positions, with
        one being east of the other. The NO was because it found the direction to
        be opposite of what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on its directional analysis that
        concluded the CIA headquarters is east (not west) of Lake Accotink.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that CIA headquarters is "to the east of Lake Accotink" and describes
        different relative positions (one being in northern Virginia near the Potomac,
        the other further south in Fairfax County).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying
        the CIA headquarters is "significantly east of Lake Accotink"
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that the CIA headquarters is not west
        of Lake Accotink (and specifically states it's east instead)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference ("east and
        slightly north"), which means the NO answer is based on a difference rather
        than equality

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicated there was a directional difference, stating
        that if one location was in MD as given in the question, it would be east
        of the other location. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" as its final answer. While
        it noted an error in the premise (CIA HQ being listed as MD), it still provided
        a definitive comparative answer based on the hypothetical scenario it considered.

        (northwest vs. west), not because the locations were at the same longitude.
        It explicitly states there is a positional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing clear directional reasoning for why the relationship
        does not match the asked condition (northwest vs. west)

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Lake Onalaska is east of
        Mississippi (where Mammy's Cupboard is). The NO answer is given because one
        location is east of the other, not because they are at the same location or
        longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Lake
        Onalaska is not west of Mammy's Cupboard" as its final comparative conclusion.
        This is a direct NO answer to the comparison question.

        alignment" and "There isn't a significant east-west offset between them" as
        the reason for its NO answer. While this suggests similarity in position,
        it's describing approximate alignment rather than exact equality, and even
        uses terms like "roughly" which indicate some potential difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lake Onalaska is

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they are on "approximately
        the same longitude," it explicitly states that Miami Beach is "further south,"
        indicating a difference in location. The NO answer appears to be based on
        Miami Beach not being west of Hobe Sound, not because the locations are exactly
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions - in fact, it explicitly states that Miami Beach is "slightly
        EAST of Hobe Sound", indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its geographical analysis
        showing that Raleigh Hotel is actually east (not west) of the Bubble Houses.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference, with the Raleigh
        Hotel being "slightly further east" and the Bubble Houses being "slightly
        west of the coastline". Even though these differences are described as "slight",
        any stated difference means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical analysis that
        the Raleigh Hotel is east (not west) of the Bubble Houses.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same in longitude. Instead, it specifically notes that "If anything,
        Raleigh Hotel is slightly EAST of the Bubble Houses" and that they're both
        on the coast but "neither is significantly west of the other". Since it indicates
        there is some difference (even if slight), this does not qualify as equal
        values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to the comparison question. This is a clear, direct NO response.

        Beach is actually slightly east of Hobe Sound, not west". This difference,
        even though described as "slight", means the NO answer was not due to equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        location is significantly inland" and concludes that "Miami Beach is not west
        of Hobe Sound". The NO answer is based on a directional comparison, not on
        equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted the locations are "very close
        in terms of longitude," it explicitly stated there is a difference, with Miami
        Beach being "slightly further east." The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, based on finding that the Raleigh Hotel is slightly east

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states that Miami Beach is "slightly more
        eastern" and Hobe Sound is "slightly more inland." While it notes they are
        "roughly on the same longitude," it then specifies a difference in their positions
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that the Raleigh Hotel is east of (not west of) the Bubble

        on the same north-south line" and in step 7 that "Neither plant is significantly
        west or east of the other." This indicates the east-west positions are effectively
        equal, and this equality is the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        that Kewaunee is "slightly east of Point Beach" due to the curved shoreline.
        Since it identifies a directional difference (even if slight), this is not
        a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, concluding that Kewaunee is
        slightly east of Point Beach.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical
        - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying
        Kewaunee is "slightly east and south" of Point Beach
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Kewaunee Power Station
        is not west of Point Beach Nuclear Plant" and provides a clear comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that Kewaunee Power Station is "slightly east and south
        of Point Beach Nuclear Plant." The NO is based on finding a directional difference
        (east instead of west), not on the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion after its step-by-step

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they are "roughly on the same
        longitude," it's not given as the primary reason for the NO answer. Additionally,
        the model notes they are "on the Lake Michigan shoreline," but explicitly
        states one is "slightly north" of the other, indicating they are not exactly
        the same. The presence of any directional difference, even if only north/south,
        means we cannot classify this as equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly stated that Kewaunee Power Station is "slightly
        east" of Point Beach Nuclear Plant, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

        the locations were equal/same - it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in position (Kewaunee being south and east of Point Beach). The NO was based
        on the direction being different than what was apparently asked about
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found a clear difference
        in location (17th St vs 11th St) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, the Cathedral
        of the Immaculate Conception is located west of the Forrest Theatre" after
        its step-by-step analysis.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that the Cathedral is EAST of the
        Forrest Theatre, indicating a clear directional difference between their locations.
        The NO was based on the opposite direction being true, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, providing specific directional reasoning
        for why one location is east (not west) of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4d9062e0-9b97-4082-b969-43b5929914a8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        Cathedral is "slightly to the east" of the Forrest Theatre, not because the
        locations are equal. It explicitly notes a directional difference between
        the positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the buildings and determining that
        the Cathedral is east (not west) of the Forrest Theatre.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a directional difference,
        saying "the Cathedral is east (and slightly north) of the Forrest Theatre"
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that one location is not west of the other.
        This was a clear, definitive NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states there is a difference in location (one theater
        is east of the other). The NO appears to be in response to a question about
        whether one theater is west of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states that Balboa Theatre is east of San Diego Civic
        Theatre, indicating a difference in location. The NO appears to be answering
        whether Balboa Theatre is west of the Civic Theatre.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the model determined there was a specific directional difference (Balboa Theatre
        is east of Civic Theatre, not west). The model identified a clear difference
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found a difference
        in location (one theater being west of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis comparing the locations of the two theaters

    a22d15ec-e152-48ba-b937-30fffec906b3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Balboa being east, not west, of Civic Theatre), not because the
        locations are the same. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        of one block between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that the Balboa Theatre is east
        (not west) of the Civic Theatre.

    bd2adf9c-0ae9-412d-ad67-85963114bbe8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that the theaters are on different avenues
        (Third vs Fourth) and concludes that Balboa Theatre is east of the Civic Theatre.
        The NO is because the direction is different than what was apparently asked
        about (west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining its reasoning about the relative locations of
        the theaters.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        one location was "slightly east" of the other, indicating a difference in
        position. The NO was because the relationship was in the opposite direction
        of what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one location is east of the
        other (Alabama is east of Indiana), indicating a clear difference in position.
        The NO appears to be rejecting some unstated original comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference ("Colonial Theatre is slightly east of Charles
        Playhouse") and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after working through the relative positions of the theaters and determining
        that Colonial Theatre is east (not west) of Charles Playhouse.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, saying "the Colonial Theatre is actually slightly east of the
        Charles Playhouse." This directional difference, even though described as
        "slight," means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the theaters, determining
        that the Colonial Theatre is slightly east of the Charles Playhouse.

        though the difference is described as "slight," any stated directional difference
        means the values are not equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        Charles Playhouse is west of the Colonial Theatre (a directional difference),
        not because the locations are the same. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining its reasoning about the relative locations of
        the theaters.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states "Colonial Theatre is slightly EAST of Charles
        Playhouse" - indicating a directional difference, even though described as
        "slight". Any difference, even if tiny, means this is not an equality-based
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO - Colonial Theatre is
        not located west of Charles Playhouse" and reaffirms with "The answer is:

    d4f91f80-1112-4f11-bfed-f5517cffed08:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Colonial
        Theatre is "slightly to the east" of Charles Playhouse). The NO is because
        the direction is opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparison, providing a specific directional explanation (Colonial
        Theatre is east, not west of Charles Playhouse)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they are "essentially on the
        same north-south line," this is not presented as exact equality but rather
        as being roughly aligned. The model uses terms like "roughly" and "essentially"
        which indicate approximate rather than exact equality. Additionally, the primary
        reasoning is about their location on the same avenue rather than stating they
        are at exactly the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the buildings are on the same
        street, it doesn't state they are at the same east-west position as the reason
        for its NO answer. Instead, it explains that one building is further north
        than the other on the same street. The model is using the alignment on the
        same street as context, not stating the buildings are at exactly the same
        longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer and
        provides a clear comparative conclusion that "St. James Cathedral is not west

        on the same north-south line on Orange Avenue" and any variation would be
        "minimal," which is the primary reason for the NO answer. This indicates they
        are effectively in the same position east-west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that St. James Cathedral is not west of the courthouse.

        locations are equal/same - it explicitly states one is south of the other
        and explains they're at different street numbers (215 vs 425). The NO answer
        is because they're on the same street and thus neither is west/east of the
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after explaining that neither building is west or east of the other

        because they are on the same street. This indicates they are at the same longitude,
        and this equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.

        street, it does not say they are at the same location - in fact, it explicitly
        notes they are at different addresses (215 vs 425) with one being south of
        the other. The NO answer is based on them being on the same street alignment,
        not because they are at the same location.

        noted different street numbers (215 vs 425) and that one is further north
        than the other. The NO answer was based on their north-south alignment rather
        than any equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        Street" while Second Presbyterian is "on Meridian Street itself," indicating
        a small difference exists. The NO answer appears to be based on Christ Church
        Cathedral being east rather than west, not because the locations are exactly
        equal.

        the model emphasizes their alignment rather than stating they are at exactly
        the same longitude. The NO answer is given because one is not west of the
        other, not because they are exactly at the same position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitudes. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, saying
        "Oklahoma City is actually slightly west of Lewis and Clark Lake" and that
        Lewis and Clark Lake is "actually slightly east" of the Music Hall. Even though
        the difference is described as "slight", any stated difference means this
        is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including "The answer is NO" as its final conclusion. It makes a definitive
        comparative statement that Lewis and Clark Lake is not west of Civic Center
        Music Hall.

        equal in longitude. Instead, it suggests that Camanche Reservoir would be
        "at approximately the same longitude or slightly west" of most Oregon locations.
        Since it mentions a possible difference ("slightly west"), even if small,
        this does not qualify as stating they are exactly equal.

        NO), this is automatically False. The model never claimed the locations were
        equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and "cannot make a definitive YES/NO determination" due to insufficient
        information. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison.

        give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate if equal values were the reason
        for a NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Civic Center is east of the cathedral), not because the locations
        are equal/same/identical. Any directional difference, even if small, means
        we should classify this as False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "approximately on the same
        north-south line" and "roughly on a similar north-south line" as the reason
        for its NO answer. This indicates the model is basing its NO answer on the
        fact that the east-west positions are essentially equal/the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Longview Lake is
        not west of Smithville Lake" as its final comparative answer.

    9959e68b-98ca-45f0-ab8c-343701cf7eaf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that "Longview Lake is slightly EAST of Smithville
        Lake's position". Even though it notes they are "fairly close in terms of
        longitude", it identifies a directional difference, which means the NO answer
        is not based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Longview Lake is slightly east of Smithville Lake's position.

        Longview Lake is east of Smithville Lake, not because the locations are equal.
        It explicitly states a directional difference ("Longview Lake is located EAST
        of Smithville Lake")
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they are "roughly aligned on
        a north-south axis," this is not presented as exact equality and is not the
        primary reason for the NO answer. The model indicates a clear directional
        difference (north-south positioning) rather than stating the lakes are at
        the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Longview Lake is
        not west of Smithville Lake" as its final comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Elmbrook Church
        is east of the 222 Building, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly stated
        there was a difference in position ("Brookfield is slightly east of Appleton").
        The NO wasn't because the locations were equal/same, but because one was slightly
        east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Elmbrook Church is not west of 222 Building.
        This was a clear negative response to the comparison.

        other, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with Calvary Church being EAST of South Coast Repertory. The NO
        answer was given because this contradicts a premise about westward position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions and determining that Calvary
        Church is east, not west, of South Coast Repertory.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (one location being east of the other), not on the locations being equal or
        the same. It explicitly states that Calvary Church is east of South Coast
        Repertory.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (one is east of the other), not because they are equal
        or the same. The model explicitly states that Calvary Church is east of South
        Coast Repertory.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Calvary Church is east of South Coast Repertory, not west. This is an
        explicit NO answer to a comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ecb01426-18b9-4cc3-9b2b-7a072cb71ca1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (one being northeast of the other), not because the locations are equal/same.
        It explicitly states that Calvary Church is northeast of South Coast Repertory.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that "In
        the Heart of the Beast is actually EAST of the Guthrie Theater" - indicating
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the locations and determining that In the Heart
        of the Beast is east of the Guthrie Theater.

    0912341b-58e3-4fe0-9dc8-0b86adb5f96e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Heart of the Beast being southeast of Guthrie), not because the
        locations are the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the theaters' locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical analysis
        showing Heart of the Beast is southeast, not west, of the Guthrie.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that In the Heart of the Beast
        is EAST of the Guthrie Theater, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - In the Heart of the
        Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre is not located west of Guthrie Theater" as its
        final answer, making a direct comparative statement.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4222dd2b-2cd9-4b7c-bd03-5b4c08aab327:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes differences in their locations,
        stating that one is "EAST of the Guthrie Theater" and they are in different
        areas (Powderhorn vs. downtown). The NO answer appears to be based on these
        differences rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly stated
        that In the Heart of the Beast is east of the Guthrie (indicating different
        positions), and this difference was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, after analyzing the relative positions of
        the two theaters and determining that one is east of the other (not west).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        one theater was explicitly stated to be east of the other, indicating a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on the relative positions of the
        theaters (stating one is east of the other, not west).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a directional
        difference ("In the Heart of the Beast is slightly EAST of Guthrie Theater").
        Any difference, even if described as "slight," means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations of both theaters and determining
        that In the Heart of the Beast is slightly east of the Guthrie Theater.
