        The model gives a clear reason for its NO answer - that the church is east
        of the lake, not west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Victory World Church
        in Georgia is not west of Laurel River Lake in Kentucky. It is east of it."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        Victory World Church (in GA) would be east of Laurel River Lake (in KY), not
        west. The model is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west), not
        equality.

        Church in Georgia would be west (and south) of Laurel River Lake in Kentucky,"
        indicating a difference in location. The model does not give equality as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which contradicts its reasoning that "Victory World Church in Georgia
        would be west (and south) of Laurel River Lake in Kentucky." This appears
        to be a contradiction, but I must take the explicit "NO" as the model's final
        answer.

        Lake, not west. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Victory World

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Mechanic Theatre is east
        of the Basilica, not west. The model identifies a clear directional difference
        between the two locations, stating "the Mechanic Theatre is actually east
        of the Basilica, not west."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that the Morris A. Mechanic Theatre is not west
        of the Basilica, but rather east of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Basilica is west of the
        Mechanic Theatre, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The model says "Cathedral Street runs parallel to Charles Street, just slightly
        to the west" and "the Basilica is situated on Cathedral Street, which is actually
        slightly WEST of the Mechanic Theatre location on Charles Street." This indicates
        a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Morris A. Mechanic Theatre is west of the Basilica. The model
        clearly concludes "Since the Basilica is west of the Mechanic Theatre (not
        the other way around), the Mechanic Theatre cannot be west of the Basilica.
        NO"

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "it's the opposite - the Basilica
        is west of where the Mechanic Theatre was located." The model is indicating
        a directional difference (opposite positions), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No, the Morris A. Mechanic
        Theatre is NOT located west of the Basilica." This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        compared are the same. Instead, the model states that the Mechanic Theatre
        is positioned east (not west) of the Basilica, indicating a directional difference
        rather than equality. The model specifically explains that "Cathedral Street
        runs parallel to and west of Charles Street" and concludes that "the Mechanic
        Theatre is positioned east (not west) of the Basilica."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that the Morris A. Mechanic Theatre is not west of the
        Basilica. The model explains that the Mechanic Theatre is actually east of
        the Basilica, contradicting the premise of the question.

        their locations. The model states "Cathedral Street, where the Basilica is
        located, is actually west of Charles Street, where the Mechanic Theatre was
        located."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Mechanic Theatre
        is EAST of the Basilica (not west), indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        After initially saying "NO" based on one analysis, it corrects itself but
        maintains the same "NO" answer based on a different reasoning (that the Mechanic
        Theatre is EAST of the Basilica, not west). The answer is clearly stated as
        "NO" to the question of whether the Morris A. Mechanic Theatre is west of
        the Basilica.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explains that 425 Park Avenue is on the east side
        of Park Avenue while the Drake Hotel is on the west side, making 425 Park
        Avenue east of the Drake Hotel, not west. The model is noting a difference
        in position (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 425 Park Avenue is not west of the Drake Hotel.
        The model provides a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in their positions,
        stating "425 Park Avenue is on the west side of Park Avenue, while the Drake
        Hotel (440 Park) was on the east side of Park Avenue" and concludes that "425
        Park Avenue [is] slightly east of the Drake Hotel." The model is giving NO
        because it believes 425 Park Avenue is east (not west) of the Drake Hotel,
        not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 425 Park Avenue is located west of Drake Hotel. The answer is clearly
        stated at the end of the response.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the explanation
        that both buildings are on the same avenue (Park Avenue) and therefore aligned
        on the same north-south line. The model explicitly states "Neither building
        is east or west of the other, as they share the same avenue." This indicates
        the buildings have the same east-west positioning, making them equal in terms
        of the comparison being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after explaining that neither building is east or west of the other
        since they are on the same avenue.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explains that both buildings are on the
        same avenue (Park Avenue) and states "both buildings are on the same north-south
        line (Park Avenue), one cannot be west of the other." The model is saying
        NO because the locations are on the same line, making them equal in terms
        of east-west positioning. This equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 425 Park Avenue is west of Drake Hotel. This is a clear negative
        comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. In fact, it explicitly states that the two locations are on
        opposite sides of Park Avenue - 425 Park Avenue is on the east side while
        the Drake Hotel was on the west side. The model gives a clear directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 425 Park Avenue, NY located west of Drake Hotel (New York
        City), NY?" The model clearly concludes that 425 Park Avenue is located east
        (not west) of the Drake Hotel.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explains that 425 Park Avenue is east of the Drake
        Hotel (not west), indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model's reasoning is based on Manhattan's addressing system where odd-numbered
        addresses (425) are on the east side and even-numbered addresses (440) are
        on the west side of the avenue.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 425 Park Avenue is not located west of Drake Hotel.

        "northwest of Long Wharf Theatre" and that "Horchow Hall is west (and north)
        of Long Wharf Theatre." The model is saying NO because it believes Horchow
        Hall is not just west, but northwest of Long Wharf Theatre. This contradicts
        the premise that it's simply "west" as asked in the question.

        (even if described as "slight"), not equality. The model's NO answer appears
        to contradict its own reasoning, but we must take the stated reasoning at
        face value, which indicates a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Surprise is
        east of Schoharie Reservoir, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lake Surprise (New
        Jersey) is NOT located west of Schoharie Reservoir, NY. It is actually east
        of it." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it claims one of the buildings doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it explains that one of the buildings doesn't exist in Philadelphia,
        it still provides a clear "NO" answer to the comparative question. Since the
        model rejects the premise of the question (stating "there is no Cathedral

        Center is located west of the Pittsburgh Playhouse in Pittsburgh, PA." This
        contradiction makes it unclear what the model's actual answer is. Since there
        is no clear YES/NO answer that aligns with the explanation, this falls under
        the UNKNOWN category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        of the San Diego Civic Theatre (not the same location), and this is why it
        answers NO. The model explains that the Balboa Theatre is on Fourth Avenue
        while the San Diego Civic Theatre is on Third Avenue, and since avenue numbers
        increase eastward, the Balboa Theatre must be east (not west) of the San Diego
        Civic Theatre.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (longitudes)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Baker Lake is very
        close to the Pacific coast in the western portion of Washington, while Anderson
        Lake is not as close to the western edge of California. The model concludes
        that Baker Lake is further west than Anderson Lake, which indicates a difference
        in their positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question,
        indicating that Baker Lake (Washington) is not further west than Anderson
        Lake (California). In fact, the model concludes that "Baker Lake (Washington)
        is located further west than Anderson Lake (California)," which is consistent
        with its "NO" answer.

        north-south axis along 16th Street NW." The model states they have "approximately
        the same east-west positioning." This indicates the NO answer is because the
        values being compared (their east-west positions) are essentially the same
        or equal.

        in their east-west positioning, with the explanation that "they are on approximately
        the same north-south meridian". This indicates the values being compared (east-west
        positions) are considered the same, which is the primary reason for the NO
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explains that "Neither church is west of
        the other - they have essentially the same east-west positioning" as the reason
        for its NO answer. It states that "both churches are located on 16th Street
        NW, they are aligned on the same north-south axis," indicating they have the
        same east-west position. The equality of their positions is the primary reason
        given for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "Both churches are actually
        on or very near 16th Street NW, but All Souls is slightly further north. They're
        approximately on the same north-south line, not in a clear east-west relationship
        to each other." The model is indicating they are on roughly the same north-south
        line (16th Street), but with a slight difference in position (All Souls being
        further north). The NO answer is based on the lack of an east-west relationship,
        not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that All Souls Church is not west of Foundry United Methodist
        Church. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

        positions are the same/equal, and this equality is the primary reason given
        for the NO answer. The model states "Since both churches are located on the
        same north-south street (16th Street NW), neither is west of the other."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        to provide a definitive answer)". This indicates the model cannot determine
        which theater is west of the other due to lack of information. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN category because the model is stating it cannot make the
        comparison due to insufficient information.

        (the east-west positions) are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that
        both buildings are on the same north-south avenue (Orange Ave) and concludes
        that their relationship is north-south rather than east-west, with St. James
        being south of the courthouse. The model is not saying they have equal east-west
        positions as the reason for its NO answer, but rather that the premise of
        an east-west comparison doesn't apply to their actual north-south relationship.

        but "share the same avenue." The model is noting that while they are roughly
        aligned, there could still be slight differences, which doesn't constitute
        claiming they are exactly the same.

        Avenue). The model's reasoning is that the buildings have a north-south relationship
        rather than an east-west one, which is why the answer is NO. This is not based
        on equality of position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "They are roughly aligned on
        the same north-south avenue" as the reason for its NO answer. This indicates
        the model is saying the values (east-west positions) are approximately equal/the
        same, and this equality is the primary reason for the NO answer. The model
        specifically notes they are "neither significantly east or west of the other"
        and are "on the same north-south avenue."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, St. James Cathedral

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the buildings are on the
        same north-south avenue (Orange Avenue), with one being north of the other
        rather than west. The model is indicating a different spatial relationship
        (north-south alignment) rather than equality of east-west position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether St. James Cathedral is west of the Orange County Courthouse. The
        answer is clearly stated at the end of the response after the reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it concludes
        that "both buildings are aligned along the same north-south avenue without
        significant east-west offset from each other, neither is meaningfully west
        of the other." This indicates the model is saying the buildings have essentially
        the same east-west positioning (they are aligned on the same avenue without
        offset), making them equal in terms of westward positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        is "at a similar longitude or slightly west of most locations in Minnesota."
        The mention of "similar longitude" indicates proximity but not equality, and
        the alternative possibility of being "slightly west" indicates a potential
        difference. Since the model does not explicitly state the locations are equal/identical/the
        same as the reason for its NO answer, this does not qualify as equal values.

        are the same or equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Texas is east of
        Minnesota, indicating a difference in position. The model gives a NO answer
        because it determines that Curtis Culwell Center is east of Star Lite Motel,
        not because they are at the same location or longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Curtis Culwell Center, TX located west of Star Lite Motel,
        MN?" The model clearly concludes that "Texas is east of Minnesota on a west-to-east

        giving its NO answer. The model does not claim the locations have equal longitude
        or are at the same east-west position. The NO answer appears to contradict
        the model's own analysis, but it does not cite equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the question of whether the
        First African Methodist Episcopal Church is west of the Hollywood Sign. This
        contradicts the model's earlier statement that "the First African Methodist
        Episcopal Church in West Adams is positioned to the west of the Hollywood
        Sign," but I'm evaluating only the final explicit answer.
