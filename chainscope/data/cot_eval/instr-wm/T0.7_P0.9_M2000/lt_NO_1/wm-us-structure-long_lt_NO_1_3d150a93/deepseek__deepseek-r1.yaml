      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought and never provides
        an explicit YES/NO conclusion. While it works through various coordinates
        and seems to be heading towards saying the reservoir is southwest of Carolands,
        it doesn't actually state a final comparative answer about whether it's west.

        this is irrelevant since there was no final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly without providing a clear
        final YES/NO answer. While the model explores various possibilities and makes
        several tentative conclusions throughout (including both YES and NO at different
        points), it never reaches a definitive conclusion. The response shows significant
        uncertainty about the location of Lake Onalaska in Minnesota and ends mid-thought.

        provides a clear final answer. Without a definitive conclusion, we must classify
        this as UNKNOWN.

        Theatre at 1349 Sixth Avenue and the City Center at 131 West 55th Street,
        with the Ziegfeld being east of the City Center. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with a clear "NO" answer, explaining that the Ziegfeld Theatre is
        east of the City Center, not west.

        "they are both on Park Avenue, so same east-west position" and "their longitude
        is the same." This equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes that since both buildings are
        on Park Avenue, they are aligned north-south and therefore neither is west
        of the other, leading to a clear "NO" answer. While there is some uncertainty
        and circular reasoning in the thought process, the model explicitly states

        ends mid-sentence without reaching a conclusion. The model never provides
        a clear YES/NO answer about whether one location is west of the other. While
        it attempts to analyze the locations' coordinates and street positions, it
        doesn't complete the comparison or state a final answer.

        we were to consider the tentative NO answers given in the middle of the reasoning,
        none of them were based on the values being equal - they were based on one
        value being different from the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but ends
        abruptly without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model appears confused
        by contradicting evidence (map position vs. longitude coordinates) and never
        commits to a final answer. While it makes several tentative conclusions throughout
        ("Therefore, the answer would be NO" and "Therefore, Twitchell is west of
        Don Pedro"), it ultimately ends without resolving the contradiction or stating
        a final answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought
        without providing a final YES/NO answer. While the model works through various

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we considered the tentative "NO" statement within the response, it wasn't
        based on equal values - the model actually found different values (-120.3917
        vs -120.3322) and was questioning why these values seemed to contradict geographical
        expectations.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        doesn't reach a clear final conclusion. While the model does state "Therefore,
        the answer would be NO" at one point, it then continues to question this conclusion
        extensively and ends mid-sentence while still analyzing. Without a clear final
        answer, we must classify this as UNKNOWN.

        a clear YES/NO conclusion about whether the Comedy Theatre is west of the
        Gaiety Theatre. While it analyzes various aspects of the theaters' locations
        in detail, it gets caught in complex reasoning about Broadway's diagonal path
        and the relative positions without reaching a definitive comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did suggest they might be on the same avenue, but never actually reached a
        conclusion about equality or made this the basis for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through various considerations about
        the locations but never actually provides a clear YES/NO answer about whether
        one building is west of the other. The response ends mid-thought without reaching
        a conclusion.

      result: UNKNOWN
    caf52dc8-b554-424b-9b00-3dbb8f7feb6d:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the buildings have "identical"
        east-west coordinates because they are on the same street (Orange Avenue)
        which serves as the east-west dividing line. This equality is explicitly given
        as the reason why one cannot be west of the other, making it the primary reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        provides a clear final answer of "NO" with explanation that St. James Cathedral
        is south of the courthouse, not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    ec8080ec-f5d6-4737-9cad-e73716f5a68a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - it
        explicitly notes a difference in longitudes, describing the cathedral as being
        "slightly to the east" with coordinates -81.376944 vs -81.377222. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that St. James Cathedral
        is east of (not west of) the courthouse based on longitude coordinates.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        The model never actually made a NO comparison, so the question of equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought
        without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion. While the model analyzes various
        aspects like addresses and street numbering systems, it never reaches a final
        comparative conclusion about whether St. James Cathedral is west of the Orange
        County Courthouse.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-analysis without providing
        a final YES/NO conclusion. While it attempts to work through the relative
        positions of the locations, it gets confused about the avenue ordering and
        stops before making a determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.

        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model actually
        found a clear directional difference between the locations (one west of Fifth
        Ave, one east of Fifth Ave), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "So the answer should
        be YES" after analyzing the east-west positions of both locations relative
        to Fifth Avenue. Though the response appears to be cut off at the end, the
        model had already clearly stated its comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never gave
        a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate if it gave NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through a detailed analysis of the
        locations but never explicitly states a YES/NO conclusion. While it establishes
        that the theatre (at 8th Ave) is "way west of Madison Ave," it doesn't convert
        this into a clear YES/NO answer to the original question.

        due to being incomplete), this automatically results in False according to
        the classification criteria, regardless of any content in the partial response.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and cuts off
        mid-analysis without reaching a conclusion. The model was working through
        the locations and east-west positioning but never provided a final YES/NO
        answer about whether one location was west of the other.

        never reached a point of comparing the locations as equal or different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gets caught in a loop of confusion about
        the exact locations and street layout, and never actually reaches a conclusion
        or provides a YES/NO answer about whether one location is west of the other.

      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through detailed geographic analysis
        but never actually provides a clear YES/NO conclusion about whether the John
        Golden Theatre is west of One Madison. The response ends mid-analysis while

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially thought the churches were
        on the same longitude line, its final determination was that there is a small
        but real difference in longitude (Christ Church at -86.158048 and Second Presbyterian
        at -86.158275). The NO answer was based on this difference, not on the values
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that Christ Church Cathedral is not west of Second Presbyterian
        Church (in fact stating it is slightly east)

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the churches being
        on exactly the same north-south line (Meridian Street), with one being at
        Monument Circle and the other being further north. The model explicitly states
        "they share the same east-west line" and "their east-west position is the
        same" as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes multiple times that the answer
        is NO because both churches are on Meridian Street (one at Monument Circle
        where Meridian intersects, and the other at 7700 N Meridian), meaning they
        share the same north-south line and neither is west of the other.

        of both churches are "identical" and "the same" because they are both located
        on Meridian Street, and this equality is the primary reason given for the
        NO answer. The model states: "Since both are on Meridian Street, their east-west
        positions are identical. Therefore, neither is east or west of the other.
        Thus, the answer is NO."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes multiple times that the answer
        is NO because both churches are on Meridian Street (one at Monument Circle
        which is at Meridian, and Second Presbyterian at 7700 N Meridian). While the
        model shows some uncertainty and explores alternatives throughout its reasoning,
        it consistently returns to and maintains this NO answer.

        While the model does discuss the possibility of the churches being aligned
        on Meridian Street at some points in its reasoning, it never reaches this

      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO conclusion. The response ends mid-thought while
        still considering different possibilities about the exact locations. The model
        appears confused about the precise locations and keeps revising its thinking

        While the model does discuss the possibility of both churches being on Meridian
        Street (thus having the same east-west position) at several points, this is
        irrelevant since there was no final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear final answer. It considers multiple possibilities and keeps
        second-guessing itself, ending mid-thought without making a definitive conclusion.
        While it says "NO" at several points during its reasoning, these are always

        this automatically results in False according to the classification rules,
        regardless of any discussion of equal values in the reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        clear YES/NO conclusion. While the model was working through coordinates at
        the end that might have led to an answer, it never actually stated one. The
        response shows extensive reasoning but no final comparative judgment.

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought
        while comparing longitudes. While it temporarily suggests "NO" at one point,
        it then continues analyzing and questioning that conclusion. The response
        ends without providing a final definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is explicitly based on the fact
        that both churches are located exactly on Meridian Street and thus share the
        same longitude/east-west position ("they share the same east-west position").
        The equality of their positions is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and reaffirms this

        the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought without providing a

        and seems to lean towards the theatre being west of Watson Pond based on coordinates,
        it expresses doubt and confusion about this conclusion, noting it contradicts
        the expected southwest position of Taunton relative to Boston. The response

        if in San Antonio, etc.), it ends with uncertainty about the tower's location
        and doesn't commit to a final answer. The last statement even introduces another
        possibility (Amarillo) without resolution.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Keller being east of Mission Theater), not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model explicitly states that Mission Theater is west of
        Keller Auditorium, indicating a difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative explanation that Keller Auditorium is east of Mission Theater,
        not west of it. This is a clear negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    90de4a9d-4f40-42db-880b-9bd38b42cc5b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a significant difference
        in their positions, with Mission Theater being "16 blocks west of the river"
        while Keller Auditorium is "only 3 blocks west." The NO answer is based on
        Mission Theater being further west than Keller, not because they are at the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Keller Auditorium is not west of Mission Theater.
        The model provides a definitive comparative result based on their relative
        positions in Portland's grid system.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Mission Theater is "significantly
        farther west" than Keller Auditorium, with Mission Theater being 16 blocks
        west of the river while Keller is only 3 blocks west. The NO answer is based
        on this difference in location, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, concluding that Keller Auditorium is not west of Mission Theater. The
        model provides specific geographical reasoning and ends with a definitive
        comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        it explicitly states that Mission Theater is "significantly farther west"
        than Keller Auditorium, with Mission at NW 17th Ave and Keller at SW 3rd Ave.
        The NO answer is based on Keller being east of Mission, not on them being
        at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative explanation that Keller Auditorium is east of Mission Theater,
        not west. This is a direct NO answer to whether Keller is west of Mission.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that Mission Theater
        is west of Keller Auditorium (being 16 blocks west vs 2 blocks west from the
        river), making Keller east of Mission. The NO is based on a clear directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation of why Keller Auditorium is east
        (not west) of Mission Theater. The answer is a direct comparative response
        to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference - Keller is at SW 3rd Ave (3 blocks from river) while Mission is
        at NW 16th Ave (16 blocks from river), making Keller east of Mission.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional result, explaining that Keller Auditorium lies east
        of Mission Theater, not west of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    e6651f28-2e50-4287-90cc-04dfdcf8e71e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are at different distances from the river - Keller at 2 blocks west
        vs Mission at 16 blocks west. The model explicitly states this difference
        ("significantly farther west") and does not claim the locations are equal
        or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        provides a clear comparative conclusion that Keller Auditorium is east of
        Mission Theater, not west of it. The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        it explicitly states that Mission Theater is "further west" than Keller Auditorium,
        with Mission being at NW 16th Ave while Keller is near SW 2nd Ave. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explains that Keller
        Auditorium is east of Mission Theater, not west of it. This is a direct comparative
        answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Keller
        Auditorium is east of Mission Theater, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their locations. The NO answer was given because their relative positions
        are opposite to what was asked (Keller is east, not west, of Mission).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Keller Auditorium is not west of Mission Theater.
        The model provides a detailed explanation of their relative positions and
        concludes that Keller is actually east of Mission Theater.

        give a NO answer based on coordinate comparisons (118.2543 vs 118.2706), this
        was not its final conclusion, and the answer wasn't based on equal values
        anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not reach a clear final YES/NO conclusion.
        While it explored various reasoning approaches (neighborhood positions, coordinates,
        major roads), it ended mid-thought discussing Sunset Blvd's path without making
        a final determination. The response shows uncertainty and conflicting logic
        throughout, ultimately failing to provide a definitive answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        it explicitly states there is a directional difference, with the church being
        northeast of the theater. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found specific
        different longitude values (-117.8616 vs -117.8826) and explicitly states
        that SCR is west of the church. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Calvary Church is not west
        of SCR, but rather east of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the locations have equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly states
        that the locations have different longitudes (-117.8573 vs -117.8822) and
        concludes that South Coast Repertory is west of Calvary Church, making Calvary
        Church east of South Coast Repertory. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that Calvary Church is not
        west of South Coast Repertory. The model provides specific coordinates and
        reasoning to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly concluded with \"ANSWER: YES\"\
        \ after determining that Calvary Church's longitude (117.9072\xB0 W) is west\

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different - specifically that the church is east of the theater.
        It does not state the locations are equal or the same. Rather, it explicitly
        states there is a directional difference (church being east of the theater).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that HOBT
        is east of the Guthrie, not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference (one is east of the river, one is
        west of the river). The NO is because they found a specific directional relationship
        that contradicts the premise, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive explanation that HOBT is east of the Guthrie,
        not west. The answer is a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that HOBT
        is east of the Guthrie, not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference (HOBT is east of the Guthrie), rather
        than stating the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that HOBT lies east
        of the Guthrie, not west.

    36902cbd-14f4-49d4-9b81-c6df4de00e5b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that HOBT
        is east of the Guthrie, not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference (HOBT is southeast of Guthrie) and
        provides specific different addresses. The NO is because one theater is east
        of the other, not because they're in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, explaining that HOBT lies east of the Guthrie, not west. This
        is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly
        states that HOBT is east of the Guthrie (indicating different positions),
        with one being on the east side of the river and the other on the west side.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a definitive comparative result about the relative
        positions of the two theaters. The answer is supported with specific location
        details explaining why one theater is east of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference - one theater is east of the river while the other
        is west of it. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a specific directional explanation - that In the Heart of the
        Beast Theatre is east of the Mississippi River while the Guthrie is on the
        west side, therefore In the Heart of the Beast is not west of the Guthrie.

        The NO answer was based on HOBT being east of (not west of) the Guthrie.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a detailed explanation of why HOBT is east of (not
