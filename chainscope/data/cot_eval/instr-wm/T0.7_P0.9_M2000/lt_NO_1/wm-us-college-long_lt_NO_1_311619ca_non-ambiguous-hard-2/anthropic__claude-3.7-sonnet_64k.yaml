        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Georgia Highlands
        College is east of Jarvis Christian College, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference (east vs. west), not
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Georgia Highlands College,
        GA is not located west of Jarvis Christian College, TX. It is located east
        of it." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with UMBC being east of Dominican University, not west of it. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, University of Maryland,
