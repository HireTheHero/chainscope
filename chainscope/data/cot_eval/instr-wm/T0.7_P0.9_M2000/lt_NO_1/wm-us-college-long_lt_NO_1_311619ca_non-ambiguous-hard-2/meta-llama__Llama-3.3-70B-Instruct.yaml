      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, explaining that "Georgia is to the east of Texas" and therefore
        "Georgia Highlands College is east of Jarvis Christian College, not west."
        The model is rejecting the westward relationship, not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Georgia Highlands College is located west of Jarvis Christian College.
        The answer is clearly stated in the conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the colleges are
        in different locations (Georgia vs Texas) and that "Texas is west of Georgia"
        and "Jarvis Christian College in Texas is west of Georgia Highlands College
        in Georgia." The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Georgia Highlands College
        is in Georgia which is east of Texas (where Jarvis Christian College is located),
        and therefore Georgia Highlands College cannot be west of Jarvis Christian
        College. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer to the question
        'Is Georgia Highlands College, GA located west of Jarvis Christian College,
        TX?' is **NO**." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the colleges are
        in different positions, with Georgia Highlands College being east of Jarvis
        Christian College. The model gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Georgia Highlands College is located west of Jarvis Christian College.
        The model concludes that "Georgia Highlands College is east of Jarvis Christian
        College" and therefore answers "NO" to the question of whether it is west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Georgia Highlands College
        is not west of Jarvis Christian College because Georgia is located east of
        Texas. The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Georgia Highlands College is located west of Jarvis Christian College.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer, stating
        "Since Texas is to the west of Georgia, any college in Texas, including Jarvis
        Christian College, would be west of any college in Georgia, including Georgia
        Highlands College." This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to whether
        Georgia Highlands College, GA is located west of Jarvis Christian College,
        TX is **NO**" as its final conclusion.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Georgia Highlands College is east of Jarvis
        Christian College, not west" because "Georgia is to the east of Texas." The
        model is clearly indicating a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Georgia Highlands College is located west of Jarvis Christian College.

        is "not west of California College of the Arts" because "Washington state
        is generally northeast of California." The model specifically notes a directional
        difference, saying Washington is "more to the north and possibly slightly
        east," which indicates the locations are not equal.
