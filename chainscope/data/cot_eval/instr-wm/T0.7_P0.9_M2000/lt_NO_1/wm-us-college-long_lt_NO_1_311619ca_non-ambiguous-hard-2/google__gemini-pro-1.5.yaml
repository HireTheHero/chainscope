      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (longitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Georgia Highlands College is in northwest
        Georgia while Jarvis Christian College is in eastern Texas, and since "Georgia
        is east of Texas," Georgia Highlands College is east of Jarvis Christian College.
        The model is indicating a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Georgia Highlands College is not further west than
        Jarvis Christian College. The model clearly provides a comparative result
        with a definitive "NO" answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    0b4a0d4a-b15e-4c5b-aff6-69a14637e78b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that Georgia is east
        of Texas, and therefore Georgia Highlands College is east of Jarvis Christian
        College. The model's "NO" answer appears to be based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response.
        This appears to be a direct answer to the comparative question, not a refusal
        or indication of uncertainty. The model worked through a step-by-step reasoning
        process and concluded with a definitive "NO."
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    233e23b4-12b8-43d2-a653-ba2ffb10c606:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Georgia is east
        of Texas, and therefore Georgia Highlands College is east of Jarvis Christian
        College. The NO answer appears to be rejecting some unstated proposition in
        the original question (possibly "Is Jarvis Christian College east of Georgia
        Highlands College?"), but it's not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, which appears to be a direct answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2eddabf9-24ec-41ee-8228-d3c696fb70de:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Georgia is east of Texas" and therefore "GHC
        cannot be west of JCC." The model is indicating a directional difference (east
        vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that Georgia Highlands College is not
        west of Jarvis Christian College.

    3d6b2bf6-c4fb-40b6-b3c7-b08d952d37d2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it concluded NO after determining that Georgia Highlands
        College is east of Jarvis Christian College (because Georgia is east of Texas).
        The model identified a directional difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that Georgia is east
        of Texas, and therefore Georgia Highlands College is east of Jarvis Christian
        College. The model's reasoning indicates a clear directional difference (east
        vs. west), not equality. The "NO" answer appears to contradict the model's
        own reasoning, but I'm evaluating only what was stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its reasoning about the locations of Georgia Highlands College
        and Jarvis Christian College. This is a clear negative response to the comparison
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    d1e53483-cfa2-4c57-8333-17fe18d3b85a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Georgia is east of Texas" and therefore "Georgia Highlands College is
        east of Jarvis Christian College." The NO answer appears to be in response
        to a question asking if one college is west of the other (though the original
        question isn't provided), and the model is saying NO because it determined
        one is east of the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly states that Georgia Highlands College
        is east of Jarvis Christian College, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The model says "Georgia is east of Texas" as the reason for
        its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Georgia is east of Texas" and therefore "a
        location in Georgia (GHC) cannot be west of a location in Texas (JCC)." The
        model is noting a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that Georgia Highlands College is not
        west of Jarvis Christian College.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provided a geographical reasoning that
        Massachusetts is east of Pennsylvania, and therefore Westfield State University
        is east of University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine. The model then
        contradicted its own reasoning by answering "NO" without explaining why. Since
        the model did not claim the locations are equal/identical/the same as the
        reason for its NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. This is a clear negative response to the
        comparison question.

    55adc285-69b7-40ec-9994-87b163fa48d5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reasoning that leads to a "NO"
        conclusion based on geographical locations, suggesting that Westfield State
        University is east of University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine (since
        Massachusetts is east of Pennsylvania). The model's "NO" answer appears to
        contradict its own reasoning, but it does not claim equality as the reason
        for the "NO" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it determines that Westfield State University
        is east of the University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine (not west),
        which is why it answers NO. The model is noting a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

    70caf6c2-9c60-44f9-8521-eaccf626feda:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it noted that "Massachusetts is generally
        east of Pennsylvania," which indicates a difference in location (east vs.
        west). The model's reasoning appears to be based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Massachusetts is east of Pennsylvania" and
        therefore "Westfield State University must be east, not west, of the University
        of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine." The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the question
        of whether Westfield State University is west of the University of Pittsburgh
        School of Dental Medicine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it walks through a reasoning process that
        suggests the locations are in different states (Massachusetts and Pennsylvania),
        and concludes with NO. The model does not claim the locations have equal coordinates
        or are at the same location. The reasoning actually suggests they are in different
        locations, but the model still answers NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it walks through a reasoning process that
        suggests the opposite (that Massachusetts is east of Pennsylvania), but then
        gives a "NO" answer that contradicts its own reasoning. The model does not
        claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        its "NO" answer (saying MVSU is east of ASU would typically support a "YES"
        answer to "Is MVSU east of ASU?"), but I'm only evaluating what was stated,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        "San Diego is south and slightly east of Monterey Bay, it is not west of it."
        This indicates a difference in position (slightly east rather than west),
        not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes "NO" because San Diego (where
        Coleman University is located) is "significantly south of Monterey Bay" rather
        than west of it. The model is making a directional comparison and finding
        they are not equal.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, YES."
        This is a clear affirmative answer to the comparative question, indicating
        that Coleman University is west of California State University, Monterey Bay.
        The model made a geographical error (San Diego is actually east of Monterey
        Bay, not west), but we're evaluating what the model stated, not factual correctness.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "Premier Flight Academy,
        OH is east of Indiana University Northwest, IN" which indicates a difference
        in location. The model's reasoning suggests that the NO answer is because
        the premise of the original question (which likely asked if one location is
        west of the other) is incorrect, not because the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        NO because the locations have different positions, with Premier Flight Academy
        being east (not west) of Indiana University Northwest. This is a directional
        difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that there is a directional
        difference - that New York is east of Kentucky, and therefore SUNY Canton
        is east of St. Catharine College, not west. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "SUNY Canton
        is east of St. Catharine College, not west" and then provides "NO" as its
        final answer.

        "significantly further west than Ohio" and that moving from Ohio to Louisiana
        "generally involves moving in a westward, as well as southward, direction."
        The model is saying NO because it believes the University of Dayton is east
        (not west) of Xavier University of Louisiana, not because they are at the
        same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        The model does not claim the locations are at the same longitude or equivalent
        in any way. The reasoning provided does not indicate equality as the basis
        for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it states "Ohio
        is east of Louisiana. Therefore, Dayton is east of New Orleans" and "The question
        asks if Dayton is west of New Orleans. Since it's east, the answer is no."
        The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Dayton is east of New
        Orleans (not west), and therefore answered "NO" to the question of whether
        Dayton is west of New Orleans.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (longitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Ball State University will have
        a lower longitude than Arkansas State University-Mountain Home because Indiana
        is east of Arkansas. The model is indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Ball State west of Arkansas State?" The model provides
        reasoning that Indiana (where Ball State is located) is east of Arkansas (where
        Arkansas State University-Mountain Home is located), and therefore Ball State
        is not west of Arkansas State.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Indiana is east
        of Arkansas, and therefore Ball State (in Indiana) cannot be west of Arkansas
        State University-Mountain Home (in Arkansas). The NO answer is based on a
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to whether
        Ball State University is west of Arkansas State University-Mountain Home.

    934adb75-fcf9-430e-aa25-7439d80b982a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, the model explicitly states "Indiana is generally
        east of Arkansas" and concludes "Ball State is EAST of Arkansas State University-Mountain
        Home." The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but
        it does not claim equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is an explicit NO response to the comparative question, appearing as
        the final line of the response.

    a3368afc-54b2-4119-8e67-ba172ecb17eb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Ball State is in Indiana
        which is generally east of Arkansas (where Arkansas State University-Mountain
        Home is located). The model concludes that something located east cannot be
        west of another location. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

    b2633cfb-fd35-4133-9ab0-0ad93efc50b6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer - specifically that Indiana is east of Arkansas, so Ball
        State (in Indiana) must be east of Arkansas State University-Mountain Home
        (in Arkansas). The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning through the geographic locations of the universities. The
        model concludes that Ball State University cannot be west of Arkansas State
        University-Mountain Home because Indiana is east of Arkansas.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes "NO" because it believes Ball
        State University is east of Arkansas State University-Mountain Home (not equal
        positions). The model's reasoning is that Indiana is east of Arkansas, therefore
        Ball State must be east of Arkansas State University-Mountain Home.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes "NO" because it determines that
        Ball State University is east of Arkansas State University-Mountain Home (not
        equal positions). The reasoning shows it believes Indiana is east of Arkansas,
        making Ball State east of Arkansas State.

        Illinois" and that Findlay, OH is in the western part of Ohio while Aurora,
        IL is in the eastern part of Illinois. The model is giving NO as its answer
        based on a directional relationship, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

        relationship, stating "Nebraska is generally east of Utah" and then concludes
        "No" to the question of whether Kearney is west of Provo. The model is rejecting
        the westward relationship, not claiming the locations are identical or equal.
        It's implying Kearney is east of Provo (not west), not that they're at the
        same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        is east of Utah, and therefore UNK (in Kearney, Nebraska) is east of BYU (in
        Provo, Utah). The model is stating there's a directional difference (east
        vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its step-by-step
        reasoning. In step 4, it explicitly answers "Is UNK west of BYU? No." and

        Provo, Utah." The NO answer appears to be based on this directional relationship,
        not on equality of values. The model is actually making a directional claim
        (west of) rather than claiming the locations are identical.

        is east of BYU (since Nebraska is east of Utah), which contradicts what was
        likely the original question about whether UNK is west of BYU. The model explicitly
        states a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        is west of Fort Wayne). The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the step-by-step reasoning where it says "Is New York City west of

        Andrews University is east (not west) of the University of Louisiana at Monroe,
        not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on a directional comparison,
        stating that Michigan is generally east of Louisiana, and therefore Andrews
        University (in Michigan) is likely to be east of University of Louisiana at
        Monroe. Since west is the opposite of east, it concludes Andrews University
        is not west of University of Louisiana at Monroe. The model is making a directional
        comparison rather than claiming the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Andrews University is not west of University of

        is east of Drake University (not west), indicating a directional difference
        between their locations. The model bases its NO answer on the fact that one
        university is east of the other, not that they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether National Louis University is west of Drake University.
        The model concludes that "National Louis University is very likely EAST of
        Drake University, meaning it is NOT west" and then provides a clear "NO" as
        its final answer.

        indicates a difference in location, not equality, despite the contradictory
        "NO" answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        gives a "NO" answer, which appears contradictory to its reasoning. However,
        there is no claim of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its reasoning about the locations of the two universities.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. In fact, it explicitly stated that the locations are different,
        with Clarkson University being east of Cornerstone University. The model concluded
        that New York is east of Michigan, and therefore Clarkson is east of Cornerstone.
        The NO answer appears to be rejecting some unstated premise in the original
        question (possibly "Is Clarkson University west of Cornerstone University?").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the locations of both universities and
        determining that Clarkson University is east of Cornerstone University.

        is in New York (an eastern state) and Cornerstone University is in Michigan
        (a midwestern state, west of New York), and concludes that "Clarkson University
        in New York is east of Cornerstone University in Michigan." The NO answer

        is east of Cornerstone University (MI), indicating a directional difference
        between their locations. The "NO" answer appears to be rejecting some unstated
        premise in the original question, but it's not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        eastern New York while Cornerstone University is in western Michigan, and
        since New York is east of Michigan, Clarkson is not west of Cornerstone. The
        NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        after explaining that "Clarkson University is *not* west of Cornerstone University."
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        response, indicating that Saint Louis University is not further west than
        Oklahoma State University-Tulsa. The model provides reasoning that Missouri
        is east of Oklahoma, therefore St. Louis is east of Tulsa.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations
        are different, with Winston-Salem State University being east of Faulkner
        University (not west). The model's reasoning is based on the relative positions
        being different (North Carolina is east of Alabama), not that they are equal
        or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is an explicit negative response to the comparative question, indicating

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Wingate University is east
        of Saint Mary's University of Minnesota (stating "Wingate University is *east*
        of Saint Mary's University of Minnesota"). The model's reasoning indicates
        a clear directional difference between the locations, not equality. The "NO"
        answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but I'm evaluating
        only what was stated, not logical consistency.

        not state that the values (locations) are equal or the same. It actually argues
        they are in different locations (East Coast vs. Midwest). The NO answer is

        so the NO answer was not given because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which directly contradicts its reasoning that "Wittenberg University is east

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "the northeastern US is generally east of the southeastern US" and concludes
        that "the University of New Hampshire at Manchester is *not* west of Shorter
        University." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (east vs.
        west), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model also states "the University of New Hampshire at Manchester is *not*
        west of Shorter University" which reinforces this NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states a difference in position,
        saying "New Hampshire is east of Georgia. Therefore, UNH Manchester is east
        of Shorter University." The NO answer appears to be in response to the original
        comparative question (likely asking if UNH Manchester is west of Shorter University),
        not because the locations are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "New Hampshire is significantly north and
        east of Georgia. Therefore, Manchester, NH is east of Georgia, not west."
        The model is rejecting the comparison because it believes one location is
        east of the other, not because they are equal.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it provides reasoning that suggests the locations
        are different (with Indiana being "generally east of Texas"). The model concludes
        "NO" despite stating that "Purdue University Northwest is EAST of Lamar University"
        in its reasoning, which appears contradictory but doesn't indicate equality
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that Missouri is east of Colorado, therefore the University
        of Missouri-St. Louis cannot be west of Regis University. The model is indicating
        a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Missouri is east
        of Colorado, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on this directional difference
        (one being east of the other), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer. This is a direct NO response to what appears to be a question
        about whether University of Missouri-St. Louis is west of Regis University.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Missouri is east
        of Colorado, and that St. Louis is in eastern Missouri while Denver is in
        eastern Colorado, which "reinforces the east-west positioning." The model
        is indicating a difference in position (east-west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Montana is east of California" and "Montana State
        University is east of California South Bay University." The model is using
        this directional difference (east vs. west) as the basis for its NO answer,
        not equality of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes that the longitudes are
        different (-75.6 for West Chester and -83.75 for Urbana) and concludes that
        West Chester is further east because -75.6 is greater than -83.75. The NO
        answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that West Chester
        is not further west than Urbana, but rather is further east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that West Chester University
        is EAST of Urbana University, and then answers NO. The model is not saying
        NO because the locations are the same, but rather appears to be answering
        NO to some unstated question about whether West Chester is west of Urbana.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its reasoning about the locations of West Chester University
        and Urbana University.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that West Chester University is at
        longitude -75.6 and Urbana University is at longitude -83.7, which are different
        values. The model explains that since -75.6 is less negative than -83.7, West
        Chester is further east (not west), which is why it answers NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the question
        of whether West Chester University is west of Urbana University.

        Since the model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer, this
        is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
