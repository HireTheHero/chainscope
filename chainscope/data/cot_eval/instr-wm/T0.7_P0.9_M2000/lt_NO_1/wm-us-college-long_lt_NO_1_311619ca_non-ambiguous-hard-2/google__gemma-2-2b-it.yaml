      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer the question
        with a YES or NO" which indicates it is unable to make the comparison due
        to lack of information (coordinates). This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        as the model indicates it cannot make the determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem (locate
        both colleges and compare their positions) but did not actually provide the
        comparison result. The model ended by offering help finding the locations
        rather than giving a definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "Since you haven't provided
        the locations of these colleges, I cannot answer the question." This indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        the comparison question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem and offered
        help with finding locations, but never actually completed the comparison or
        stated a conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. It only outlined the steps needed to answer the question
        and offered to provide the locations and comparison if requested, but did
        not actually complete the analysis or state a conclusion.

      result: UNKNOWN
    5d8afae9-4e67-4bc8-aa9c-b1bdac46541f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model
        did not make a comparison claiming the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it stated it was "unable to provide
        real-time information about specific locations" and recommended using a map
        service to find the answer. This is effectively refusing to make the comparison.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    c175f402-2b73-4827-84ba-b1802fdfd6e4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, the
        second question automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly refuses to answer the question,
        stating "I can't answer that question" and explaining why it cannot make the
        comparison (lack of location data and real-time information). It suggests
        using a mapping tool instead. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    c200441b-2b05-4820-98f0-705d9f839138:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are
        the same does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer
        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it outlined steps that would need to
        be taken to answer the question (finding locations of both colleges and then
        comparing them), but did not actually complete these steps or provide a conclusion.
        The response ends with an offer to help find the locations, indicating the
        model did not reach a determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the question. It only outlined steps for how one could determine the answer
        (find locations, map them, compare positions) but did not actually state a
        conclusion about whether Georgia Highlands College is west of Jarvis Christian
        College. The model ended by offering to provide a map or tool to help visualize
        this, indicating it did not provide a definitive answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot answer this question without more information
        about the specific locations of these colleges" and suggests that one would
        need to use a map or online resources to determine the answer. This indicates
        the model is unable to make the comparison with its available knowledge.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that both Massachusetts and Pennsylvania
        are on the East Coast, but doesn't explicitly state they are at the same longitude
        or have equal positions. The model doesn't provide a clear reason why the
        answer is NO beyond stating the locations of both institutions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    130bf413-c94b-4c19-a2e8-dcc353acedc7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        two universities are in different states (Massachusetts vs. Pennsylvania)
        and different regions (New England vs. Mid-Atlantic), concluding they are
        "on different sides of the country." This indicates a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states they are "located in
        different states, and thus not in the same general geographic area." The NO
        answer is based on a difference in location (Massachusetts vs. Pennsylvania),
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2b39f268-9cea-4a9e-827c-6f7620e4b687:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that "both are on the East Coast" and
        then says "we need to look at the direction" before concluding NO. It doesn't
        explicitly state that the locations have equal longitude or are at the same
        point east/west, nor does it claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7d86ce4e-a2de-4fc7-ad81-6a38578b449f:

      explanation_equal_values: 'The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes differences: "These are in different
        states" and "Massachusetts is to the east of Pennsylvania." The NO answer
        is based on these differences in location, not on equality.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of the two institutions.

    9ace9d80-b442-40ad-8085-43e1d77b42d6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, it concludes that "Westfield State
        University is located west of the University of Pittsburgh School of Dental
        Medicine" right before giving its NO answer, which is contradictory but doesn't
        indicate equality as the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a clear comparative judgment.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the two universities are in different states (Massachusetts and Pennsylvania).
        The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

    afced411-2df3-40a3-8456-d2398706918f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes a difference in locations (Westfield,
        MA is "in the eastern part of the United States" while Pittsburgh, PA is "in
        the mid-west"), which is the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Westfield is on the opposite
        side of the state" as its conclusion before giving the NO answer. The model
        is noting a difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states "Westfield is not west of Pittsburgh"
        without indicating they are at the same longitude or otherwise equal in position.
        The model does not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating
        that "Marywood University is located west of Radford University" as the reason
        for its NO answer. The model is not claiming equality as the reason for the
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, Marywood University
        is located west of Radford University. So the answer is NO." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that "Virginia is to the west of
        Pennsylvania" as the reason for its NO answer, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations of Marywood University and Radford University.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer this
        question without a map" and does not provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. The model acknowledges its inability to make
        the comparison without visual information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it identifies that Marywood University is
        in Scranton, PA and Radford University is in Radford, VA, implying they are
        in different locations. The model does not claim they are at the same longitude
        or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It clearly indicates that Marywood University is not west of Radford University,
        providing a direct comparative result.

    53f7fcb4-3ece-4b5a-b5b5-3b79615d2aec:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations of the universities) are equal or the same. It simply states
        "No" after identifying that Marywood University is in Pennsylvania and Radford
        University is in Virginia. It does not explicitly state that they are at the
        same longitude or that they are equal in any way that would justify the NO
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and indicates that "Without specific locations, it's impossible
        to answer." This shows the model is refusing to make a comparative judgment
        due to lack of information.

        "The states are in different geographical regions, making it clear they are
        not in the same general area." The NO answer is based on these differences,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, the
        second question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all,
        so by the criteria provided, this must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly refuses to answer the question,
        stating "I can't answer that question" and explaining why it cannot make the
        comparison due to lack of location data. This is a clear refusal to provide
        a comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlined steps to solve the problem
        and asked for more information about the locations. The model explicitly states
        "let me know and I can help you determine if Premier Flight Academy is west
        of Indiana University Northwest" indicating it has not made a determination
        yet.

        - it determines that Haverford College (in Pennsylvania) is not west of Samford
        University (in Alabama) based on their geographic positions relative to the
        Mississippi River. The NO is based on directional comparison, not equality.

        being compared are equal or the same. It simply notes that both institutions
        are in Minnesota, but doesn't explicitly state this equality as the reason
        for the NO answer. The model doesn't clearly articulate why being in the same
        state leads to a NO answer.

        or 'no' based on the information given" and indicates that more research would
        be needed to determine the answer. The model does not provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer, but rather indicates it cannot make the determination with

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that "both
        are in the same state" (Minnesota). It explicitly states that "Since both
        are in the same state, Bethel University is not located west of Minnesota
        State Community and Technical College." This indicates the model is treating
        the locations as equal or the same based on their state, and this equality
        is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether Bethel University is located west
        of Minnesota State Community and Technical College.

        locations are in the same state" - it's claiming they are in the same state
        (Minnesota), and this equality of state location is the primary reason given
        for the NO answer. The model does not note any difference in their specific
        locations within Minnesota.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that "Bethel University is in Tennessee,
        and Minnesota State Community and Technical College is in Minnesota. They
        are geographically separated." The model is noting a difference in location
        (different states) as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal, identical, or the same. It only mentions that both institutions
        are in the same state (Minnesota), but does not claim they are at the same
        location or have the same longitude. Being in the same state is not equivalent
        to having equal geographical coordinates. The model concludes "NO" based on
        them being in the same state, not because they have identical locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Bethel University is west of Minnesota State Community and Technical
        College.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that "it's
        not possible for Minnesota to be west of itself" - which is stating that the
        locations are in the same state (Minnesota) and therefore one cannot be west
        of the other. This is explicitly stating that the values are the same (both
        schools are in Minnesota) and this equality is the primary reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given a NO
        answer based on equal values.

        The model did not make any comparison about equality or difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it offered steps for how to find the
        information (looking up locations and using a mapping service) but did not
        actually make the comparison itself. The response ends with "Let me know if

        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Full Sail University is in Florida
        and Davenport University is in Michigan, and then concludes "NO" without explicitly
        stating that this is because the locations are equal. In fact, it identifies
        they are in different states.

        are the same. Instead, it states that New York (where SUNY Oneonta is) is
        to the east of North Carolina (where St. Andrews is). The model is saying
        NO because the directional relationship is the opposite of what was asked
        - it's saying Oneonta is east, not west, of St. Andrews. This is a difference
        in values, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "SUNY Oneonta is not located west of St. Andrews University"

        and St. Andrews University are at the same longitude or location. The model
        simply provides a process for determining the answer and then states "NO"
        without explaining that the reason is due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and direct, with "NO" in
        bold, indicating it's the model's definitive response.

        that equality is the reason for the NO answer. The model simply notes they
        are in different states without claiming this makes them equal in any way.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't provide a clear reason for its
        NO answer beyond noting the locations of the institutions in different states
        (Michigan and Minnesota). Since equality is not mentioned as the reason for
        the NO answer, this does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.

        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer the question
        with a YES or NO" and indicates it doesn't have access to the necessary geographical
        information to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot determine the answer.

        Ohio (where Western College for Women is located) and Louisiana (where University
        of Louisiana at Lafayette is located) are in different regions, with Ohio
        being in the Midwest and Louisiana in the South. The model specifically notes
        that "West of Louisiana is in the opposite direction of Ohio," indicating
        a difference in location rather than equality.

        stating that "it's highly unlikely that Western College for Women is located
        west of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette" due to the geographic locations
        of Ohio and Louisiana. The model is making a directional comparison and finding
        a difference, not equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model provided steps to solve the problem but
        did not actually give a final YES or NO answer to the comparison. It merely
        outlined a methodology and ended with "Let me know your answer after completing
        these steps!" This indicates the model did not provide a definitive comparative

        in the West region of the United States and Colorado State University Pueblo
        is located in the West region of the United States"). This indicates the model
        is saying NO because both universities are in the same region (the West),
        making them equal in terms of their regional classification.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

        - that Judson University is not located west of the University of Houston-Victoria
        because they are on different sides of the Mississippi River. The model is

        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave a NO
        answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the question. Instead, it states "You'll need to look up the locations

        state that the values being compared are equal or the same. It simply states
        that both universities are in the western United States, but doesn't explicitly
        say this equality is the reason for the NO answer. While this equality appears
        to be implied as the reason, the model doesn't explicitly state "they are
        equal" or "they are the same" as required by the criteria.

        Benedictine University is not west of the University of Texas at San Antonio
        due to their regional locations (Illinois in the Midwest vs. Texas in the

        West Coast (Washington and California are both on the West Coast), which is
        the reason for its NO answer. The model is not saying the locations are identical,
        just that they're both on the same coast.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Louisville, Kentucky
        is located further west" than Athens, Georgia, indicating a difference in
        their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.

        clarifies in parentheses that "We cannot answer because of the unknown second
        university." This indicates the model is actually saying it cannot determine
        the answer due to lack of information about National American University's

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Oklahoma is a state, Midland College
        is in Texas, and Oklahoma is a neighboring state to Texas. The model does
        not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        would determine the direction and consider which side of the state line they
        are located on, but doesn't actually provide the reason for the NO answer.
        Since equality is not explicitly stated as the reason for the NO answer, this
        is False.

    9c24f5c8-bad8-4209-ba10-e45bb10d4d13:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that "Rancho Santiago
        Community College District is in a different county and a different area of
        California than California State University, East Bay." The NO answer is based
        on this difference in location, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the locations of the two institutions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a45f8ec8-a6e8-4777-9164-6e28fc8a7f1b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was REFUSED),
        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "We cannot say YES or
        NO" and indicates it doesn't have enough information to determine the exact
        locations of the institutions. This is a clear refusal to provide a definitive
        comparative answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    aa772119-b7f6-4ad2-bb63-de0edf19c97e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states "it's likely that the
        locations are in different areas of the state" as the reason for its NO answer,
        indicating a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given a NO
        answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it offered a methodology for how one
        could determine the answer, but did not actually make the determination itself.
        The response ends with an offer to guide the user through finding the locations
        and making the comparison, indicating it has not yet provided a definitive
        answer.

    0a0bb021-c824-4f3f-9adf-1810e01fa672:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that the universities are in different
        states (Michigan and Missouri) and uses this difference as the basis for its
        NO answer. The model is not claiming the locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion to whether Wayne State University School of Social Work is located
        west of Drury University.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "Detroit is east of Springfield" (not west).
        This is a directional difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it states that it "cannot
        definitively determine" the relative locations due to not having exact distance
        information. The NO answer is based on inability to verify the comparison,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion. While the model mentions it cannot definitively
        determine the relative locations, it still provides a clear NO answer rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating uncertainty in its final conclusion.'

      result: 'NO'
    81dc66a2-13c0-4ffd-be13-76655c5b8b26:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Detroit, Michigan is not located
        west of Springfield, Missouri" which implies they are in different locations.
        The model is making a directional comparison and determining that one is not
        west of the other, not that they are equal or identical in location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when determining whether Wayne State University School of Social Work is west
        of Drury University. The answer is clearly labeled as "Answer: NO" at the
        end of the response.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't claim that the locations have
        the same longitude or are at the same position. Instead, it states that it
        lacks information about the exact distance between the two schools, which
        is a different reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it mentions not having information about the exact distance, it still
        provides a clear "NO" answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        uncertainty in its final conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Michigan and Missouri are
        in different states" and concludes that "Wayne State University School of
        Social Work is not located west of Drury University." The NO answer is based
        on directional comparison, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that "These two locations are in
        different states and on different sides of the country" which indicates a
        difference in location, not equality. The NO answer is based on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "the geographical locations
        of these universities are on different continents, and the distance between
        them is significant" - indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "you can't give a simple
        YES or NO answer based on the information provided." The model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison without looking up additional information about
        the distance and directions between the two locations.
