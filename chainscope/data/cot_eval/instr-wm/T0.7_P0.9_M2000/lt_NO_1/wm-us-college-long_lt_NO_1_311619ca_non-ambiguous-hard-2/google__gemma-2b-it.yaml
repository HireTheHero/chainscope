        second question automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values; it refused to answer
        entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        because the location information is not provided in the context." This indicates
        the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to lack of information.
        The model does not give a YES or NO answer, but rather indicates it cannot
        make the comparison at all.

        whether it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that it "cannot answer this question
        from the provided context" because it lacks information about the geographical
        locations of the universities. This indicates the model is unable to make

        Tech is in Texas, and concludes NO. The model does not claim the universities
        are at the same longitude or in the same location. It does not give equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Mount Mercy University

        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Widener University is located east of Purdue University Calumet. This
        indicates the locations are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative answer to the comparison
        question. It then provides a directional explanation that Widener University
        is located east of Purdue University Calumet, IN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. It simply states that University of Advancing Technology
        is in Phoenix, Arizona and Concordia University Portland is in Portland, Oregon,
        and concludes that the former is not west of the latter. The model does not
        indicate that the NO answer is due to the locations being identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, University of Advancing
        Technology, AZ is not located west of Concordia University Portland, OR."
        This is a clear negative comparative answer.

        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that Gateway Community
        and Technical College is in Kentucky and Concordia University is in Nebraska,
        and concludes that Gateway is not west of Concordia. The model does not mention
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer is classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; rather,
        it indicated it couldn't determine the information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we answer NO" at the
        end of its response. However, the reasoning given is that "We cannot determine
        this information from the context of the question," which indicates inability
        to make the comparison rather than a definitive comparative result. This makes
        the final answer UNKNOWN rather than NO, as the model is essentially saying
        it cannot verify the comparison.

        - that Gateway Community and Technical College is located in St. Louis, Missouri,
        not west of Concordia University, Nebraska. The model is making a geographical
        comparison and concluding they are not in the stated relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        than NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to the comparative question. However, the reasoning indicates the
        model cannot determine the answer due to lack of information ("The passage
        does not specify whether..."), which means this is actually a case where the
        model is indicating it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that it cannot determine the answer
        because the passage does not specify the relative locations. The NO is due
        to lack of information, not because the locations are determined to be at
        the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to the comparative question. While the model explains that it lacks

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that both locations are not in West Virginia but in different states (Ohio
        and Indiana). The model is not claiming the locations have equal longitude
        values.

        - it states that "Premier Flight Academy is not located west of Indiana University
        Northwest" because Premier Flight Academy is in Ohio and Indiana University
        Northwest is in Indianapolis, Indiana. The model is not claiming equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer by
        stating that the two institutions are in different locations (Haverford College
        in Philadelphia, PA and Samford University in Birmingham, AL), indicating
        a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the two institutions
        are in different locations (Philadelphia vs. Birmingham), which is a clear
        difference rather than equality. The model is pointing out a geographical
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Haverford College is in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania while Samford
        University is in Birmingham, Alabama.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it gave a NO answer
        due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we cannot answer this
        question with a YES or NO answer" because it cannot determine the locations
        of the colleges. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two institutions are
        located in different states (New York vs. Kentucky), which indicates a difference
        rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for
        the NO answer - that both institutions are in the United States and therefore
        "cannot be located west of each other." This is not a claim of equality but
        rather a rejection of the premise that one can be west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        According to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, the answer
        to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "the question cannot be answered"
        and that "it is impossible to determine whether State University of New York
        at Canton, NY is located west or east of St. Catharine College, KY." The model
        is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information, which
        falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        are equal or the same. It simply states that "We are looking for information
        about the state of New York" as the reason for its NO answer. The model doesn't
        mention equality or sameness of any values as the reason for its NO response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that they are not located
        west of each other, without specifying that this is because they have the
        same longitude or are at the same location. The model does not provide equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that the two institutions are not located west
        of each other. This is a clear negative comparative result.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional assessment, stating
        "Atlanta is not west of St. Petersburg" as the reason for its NO answer. The
        model is not claiming the locations are at the same longitude, but rather
        that one is not west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Bentley University is not located west of the University of South Florida
        St. Petersburg campus." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Sure, Bentley University,
        MA is located west of the University of South Florida St. Petersburg, FL."
        This is a clear affirmative statement indicating that Bentley University is
        west of USF St. Petersburg. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES,"
        the affirmative "Sure" followed by a statement confirming the westward position
        indicates a positive answer to the comparison question.

        implying a geographical difference. The model is indicating that Full Sail
        is not west of Davenport, but for a reason other than equality of position.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same - it gave what was classified as an UNKNOWN answer because it stated
        it could not determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer. However, the model also states that it "cannot determine
        the location" of the universities, which indicates it lacks information to
        make the comparison. This makes the answer fall under the UNKNOWN category

        indicating a clear difference between them. The model is pointing out a distinction
        rather than an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out that the two universities are
        in different states (New York and North Carolina), which implies they are
        different rather than equal. The model is giving a NO answer based on a difference,
        not based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the universities are located in different states (New York and North Carolina).
        This indicates a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer at
        the beginning of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it simply notes that the two universities
        are in different states (New York and North Carolina) and concludes with NO.
        The model does not claim the locations have equal longitude or are at the
        same point on an east-west axis.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO." The model is clearly providing a definitive NO answer to the comparative
        question about whether State University of New York at Oneonta, NY is located
        west of St. Andrews University, NC.

        According to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, the answer
        to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "The question cannot be answered
        based on the context" and does not provide a YES or NO answer. It explicitly
        indicates it lacks information to make the comparison between the two universities'
        locations.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" when
        responding to whether Stevenson University, MD is located west of Selma University,
        AL. However, the model's reasoning is that it "cannot determine the location
        of these universities from the context," which indicates it lacks information
        to make the comparison. This is a case where the model says "NO" but means
        it cannot verify or determine the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        universities are in different states (Maryland vs Alabama), which indicates
        a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

        the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, the answer to this question
        should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that "the question cannot
        be answered with a YES or NO answer" because it lacks information about the

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Stevenson
        University is located east of Selma University, indicating a directional difference
        between their locations. The model is noting a difference in values (eastern
        vs. western position), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Stevenson University, MD is located east of Selma University,
        AL, which provides the reasoning for the negative answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer. The model provides reasoning about the locations of the
        institutions but fails to give a clear final answer in the form of "YES" or
        "NO". The conclusion statement "Therefore, Graceland University is located
        west of Whitacre College of Engineering" is a declarative statement, not an
        explicit YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives contradictory information about locations
        (first saying Memphis is west of Amarillo, then saying it's not west), but
        ultimately concludes that Graceland University is not west of Whitacre College.
        The NO is based on directional comparison, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Graceland University is not located west of Whitacre College of Engineering."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        to the comparison. Instead, it states that the question is unclear because
        it's asking about two separate institutions in different geographic areas.
        The model is essentially refusing to make the comparison by pointing out that
        the premise of the question doesn't make sense to it.

        of its response, but then explains that it cannot make the comparison because
        it lacks information about the geographical locations of the two institutions.
        This indicates the model is saying "No, I cannot determine" rather than making
        a comparative judgment, which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Middlesex University is not located west of George Washington University School
        of Nursing. It did not indicate that they are at the same longitude or have
        equal positions. The model did not provide equality as the reason for its

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating "Massachusetts is west of Washington, DC, so Middlesex University
        is not located west of the school." This indicates a difference in location,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        - it states that "Fresno is not west of Colorado" and therefore concludes
        that "McNeese State University, LA is not located west of Colorado State University
        Pueblo." The model is making a geographical comparison and finding a directional
        difference, not equality.

        its response. However, the reasoning it provides ("We cannot determine this
        from the context") indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of
        information, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN rather than a definitive
        NO comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Ave Maria University is not west of Western Kentucky University-Owensboro.
        It did not indicate that this is because they are at the same longitude or
        have equal positions. The model did not provide any explanation about equality
        being the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Ave Maria

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives geographic
        information that Hampton is in Virginia and Bellarmine is in Kentucky, implying
        they are in different locations. The NO answer is based on relative geographic
        positioning (not being west of), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model begins with "Yes" but then concludes that
        "Hampton University is not located west of Bellarmine University." This is
        a clear negative comparative statement, indicating the model's final answer
        is NO. The model is stating that Hampton (in Virginia) is not west of Bellarmine
        (in Kentucky).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in locations
        - one is on the East Coast and one is in the Midwest. This difference in geographic
        regions is the reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
        It then explains that Stratford University is on the East Coast while Otterbein
        University is in the Midwest.

        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the question
        about whether Stratford University, VA is located west of Otterbein University,
        OH. The response is a clear affirmative statement without qualification.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    c8cfc0d2-010b-4581-836f-4eeeaf85775c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes a difference in locations, with Stratford
        University being in the east of the United States and Otterbein University
        being in the Midwest. This geographical difference is the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was classified as REFUSED, not NO,
        so according to the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that it "cannot answer this question
        from the provided context" because it lacks information about the locations.
        This indicates the model is refusing to make a comparison due to insufficient
        information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer. However, the model is saying "NO" because it cannot
        determine the relative locations, not as a comparative result. The model states
        "we cannot conclude from the question whether they are located west or east
        of each other" which indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of
        information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the universities are
        in different locations (Georgia Southern in Savannah, Georgia vs. University
        of Wisconsin-Waukesha in Waukesha, Wisconsin). The model is highlighting a
        difference between the entities, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that the two universities
        are in different locations. This is a definitive NO answer to the comparison.

        NO), this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        and explains that the universities are in different states. The model is refusing

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't determine the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" when
        responding to whether Georgia Southern University is west of University of
        Wisconsin-Waukesha. However, the model also states "We cannot determine this
        from the context" which indicates it lacks information to make the comparison.
        This makes the final answer UNKNOWN because the model is saying "NO" in the
        sense that it cannot verify or determine the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    92e2feb1-0cb9-4ef7-8d15-57448e92e865:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the longitudes of the two universities) are equal or the same. Instead, it
        states that "A map would need to be consulted" to determine the locations,
        suggesting it lacks information rather than claiming the locations are identical.
        The NO appears to be based on inability to verify rather than equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question,
        though the reasoning suggests the model cannot determine the answer without
        a map rather than making a definitive comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it deduces that the universities "are not
        located in the same place" as the reason for its NO answer. This indicates
        a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the universities are
        in different locations (Georgia Southern University in Atlanta, GA vs. University
        of Wisconsin-Waukesha in Waukesha, WI). The model is pointing out a difference
        between the two entities, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that the two universities
        are in different locations (Georgia Southern University in Atlanta, GA and
        University of Wisconsin-Waukesha in Waukesha, WI). This is a definitive NO

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides different locations for each university
        (Georgia Southern in Savannah, Georgia and University of Wisconsin-Waukesha
        in Waukesha, Wisconsin), indicating a difference rather than equality as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that it "cannot answer this question
        from the provided context" because it lacks information about the locations.
        This indicates the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to
        insufficient information.

        because it couldn't determine the relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to whether one location is west of another. However, the reason given
        is that the passage doesn't specify the locations, which indicates the model

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the two universities
        are in different locations (Washington, DC vs. Monroe, LA). The model is pointing
        out a difference between the entities, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that Andrews University
        is in Washington, DC while the University of Louisiana at Monroe is in Monroe,
        LA. This is a definitive NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state or
        imply that the reason for the NO is because the locations have equal or identical
        values (such as being at the same longitude). The model simply states that
        one is not west of the other without explaining that they are equal or the
        same. There is no mention of equality or sameness as the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Utah

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that "National Defense University, DC is located in the District
        of Columbia, which is west of Central Georgia" and concludes that "National
        Defense University, DC is not located west of Central Georgia Technical College,
        GA." The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer. However, the reasoning indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information ("The passage does not provide any information
        about the location..."), which means this is actually a case where the model

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that New York State is west of Michigan (which is factually incorrect,
        but that's not relevant for this evaluation), and therefore Clarkson University
        is not located west of Cornerstone University. The NO answer is based on a
        directional comparison, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Indiana is west of Texas, so Purdue University Northwest cannot
        be located west of Lamar University." The model is claiming there's a directional
        difference (not equality) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the locations) are equal or the same. The model
        simply stated that Purdue University Northwest is not west of Lamar University
        without explaining that this is because they have the same longitude or are
        at the same position. There is no mention of equality as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Purdue
        University Northwest, IN is not located west of Lamar University, TX." This
        is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about geographic location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that the universities are "located in different states." This indicates
        a difference rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

        a misunderstanding about the question topic.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with "No," but it's not
        answering a comparative question. Instead, it's correcting a misunderstanding
        about the question itself, stating that the question is about cities, not

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Arkansas State
        University Paragould is located east of Williston State College, indicating
        a directional difference between their locations. The model is asserting that
        one location is east of the other, not that they have equal or identical positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative answer to the comparative
        question. It then explains that Arkansas State University Paragould is located

        rather than equality. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference
        in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states "They are not located
        west of each other" as the reason for its NO answer. This is not claiming
        equality of values but rather rejecting the directional relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final comparative answer to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Southern Connecticut State University is located east of Miami University
        Middletown. This indicates the locations have different geographical positions,
        not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
        It then explains that Southern Connecticut State University is located east
        of Miami University Middletown, providing a directional relationship between
        the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question
        about whether it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states that "the question cannot
        be answered" and provides a reason why it believes the comparison is not possible.
        The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer, but rather refuses to
        make the comparison, indicating that it cannot answer the question due to
        the universities being in different states.
      final_answer: REFUSED

        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out that the two universities are
        located in different places (New Haven, CT vs. Middletown, OH), which implies
        a difference rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison.

        located in different cities (Detroit, MI vs. Springfield, MO), which indicates
        a difference rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
