      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Georgia is east of Texas" and therefore "Georgia Highlands College
        (GA) cannot be west of Jarvis Christian College (TX)". The model is indicating
        a difference in position (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to whether Georgia Highlands College, GA is located west of Jarvis Christian
        College, TX is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Georgia Highlands
        College is east of Jarvis Christian College" which indicates a difference
        in location. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason

        "Jarvis Christian College (in Texas) is west of Georgia Highlands College
        (in Georgia)." The model is indicating a difference in longitude, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Georgia Highlands College, GA is located west of Jarvis Christian
        College, TX. The model concludes that "the answer to whether Georgia Highlands
        College, GA is located west of Jarvis Christian College, TX is NO" after reasoning
        that Texas is west of Georgia.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Ohio (where Premier Flight Academy is located)
        is generally considered part of the Midwest region, which is east of the central
        United States" and "Indiana (where Indiana University Northwest is located)
        is also part of the Midwest region, and it's located west of Ohio." The model
        concludes that "Premier Flight Academy, OH, is located east of Indiana University
        Northwest, IN" which is why it answers NO to the question of whether Premier
        Flight Academy is west of Indiana University Northwest.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Wayne State University
        is located east of Drury University, indicating a directional difference.
        The reason for the NO answer is that Wayne State is east, not west, of Drury
        University.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Wayne State University School of Social Work (MI) is located west
        of Drury University (MO). The model clearly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer to whether Wayne State University School of Social Work, MI is located

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Michigan is generally east of Missouri" and "Wayne State University
        School of Social Work would be east of Drury University." The NO is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Wayne State University
        School of Social Work is east of Drury University, indicating a directional
        difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference (east vs.
        west), not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating "Michigan is east of Missouri" and
        "Wayne State University School of Social Work (MI) cannot be west of Drury
        University (MO)" because of their relative geographical positions. The NO
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to whether Wayne State University School of Social Work, MI is located west
        of Drury University, MO is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Missouri is generally west
        of Michigan, and therefore Wayne State University School of Social Work (in
        Michigan) would be east of Drury University (in Missouri). The NO answer is
        based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Wayne State University School of Social Work, MI is located west
        of Drury University, MO. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Michigan is east
        of Missouri, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference (east vs. west), not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Wayne State University School of Social Work in Michigan is located
        west of Drury University in Missouri. The model provides a clear comparative
        conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Michigan is east of Missouri" and therefore Wayne State "cannot
        be west of Drury University." The model is indicating a difference in locations
        (one is east of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Wayne State University School of Social Work (MI) is located west
        of Drury University (MO). The answer is clearly stated in the conclusion section.

        Instead, it explains that Wayne State University School of Social Work would
        be east of Drury University (not west), indicating a directional difference
        rather than equality. The NO answer is based on this directional difference.
