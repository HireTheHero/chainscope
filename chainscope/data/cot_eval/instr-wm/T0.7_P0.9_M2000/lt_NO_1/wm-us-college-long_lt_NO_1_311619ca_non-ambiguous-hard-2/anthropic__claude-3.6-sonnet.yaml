        it found that "Stony Brook (NY) is EAST of Baldwin Wallace (OH)" rather than
        west as the question asked. The values are not equal; they represent different
        geographical positions.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the University of
        Georgia College of Public Health is EAST of The College of Saints John Fisher
        & Thomas More, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that UGA is east of the Texas college, not west as the question asked. The
        model explicitly states that "Athens, GA is east of Fort Worth, TX" and therefore
        UGA "must be east of The College of Saints John Fisher & Thomas More." This
        indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether UGA is west of the Texas college. The model clearly
        concludes that since Athens, GA is east of Fort Worth, TX, the University
        of Georgia College of Public Health cannot be west of The College of Saints
        John Fisher & Thomas More.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Georgia is clearly
        east of Texas" and "University of North Georgia must be east of Lee College"
        - indicating a difference in position, not equality. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        in different positions, with UNG being east of Lee College. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether University of North Georgia is west of Lee College.
        The model explains that UNG is in Georgia (east) while Lee College is in Texas
        (west), and concludes "Since UNG is east of Lee College, it cannot be west
        of it" followed by "NO".

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that UNG is east of Lee College (not west). The model explicitly states "Georgia
        is significantly east of Texas" and "UNG must be east of Lee College," indicating
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether UNG is west of Lee College. The model determined that UNG is east
        of Lee College, not west, and therefore answered NO to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values

        that the directional relationship is the opposite of what was apparently asked
        (stating Montana State University is east, not west, of California South Bay
        University). The model identified a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model determined that Montana State University is east (not west) of California
        South Bay University, and therefore answered "NO" to what appears to be a
        question about whether Montana State University is west of California South
        Bay University.

        (one is east of the other), not that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Montana State University
