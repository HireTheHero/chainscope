      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values being compared\
        \ are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that the longitudes are different\
        \ (Wayne State at 83.0458\xB0 W and Drury at 93.2923\xB0 W) and concludes\
        \ that \"Drury is west of Wayne State\" and \"Wayne State is east of Drury.\"\
        \ The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO. Wayne State University
        (MI) is east of Drury University (MO)" as its final answer. This is an explicit
        NO to the comparative question of whether Wayne State is west of Drury.

      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values being compared\
        \ are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that the longitudes are different\
        \ (Detroit at ~-83.04\xB0 and Springfield at ~-93.29\xB0) and concludes that\

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the beginning of
        its response and concludes with "Wayne State (Detroit) is east of Drury (Springfield),
        so it is not located west of Drury University." This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.
