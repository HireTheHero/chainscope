      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Georgia Highlands
        College is east of Jarvis Christian College, indicating a directional difference.
        The reason for the NO answer is that the locations have different positions
        (Georgia is east of Texas), not that they are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" and reiterates "The answer is NO" at the end. The model is directly answering
        the comparative question with a definitive NO, indicating that Georgia Highlands
        College is not west of Jarvis Christian College (rather, it's east).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in longitude values
        (Westfield at 72.7 degrees West and Pittsburgh at 80.0 degrees West) and concludes
        that Pittsburgh is west of Westfield, not that they are at the same location.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Westfield State University is west of University
        of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine. The model clearly concludes that
        "Pittsburgh, PA is located west of Westfield, MA" and "Westfield State University,
        MA is located east of University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine,
        PA."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Pittsburgh is west
        of Westfield (and Westfield is east of Pittsburgh), indicating a clear directional
        difference between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that since Pittsburgh is west of Westfield, Westfield is east
        of Pittsburgh, which contradicts the question asking if Westfield is west
        of Pittsburgh.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9a5379cc-8ef4-4b81-ae21-4c1fb1aa7f3f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Westfield, MA is
        clearly east of Pittsburgh, PA" and that "Pittsburgh, PA is much further west
        than Westfield, MA." The NO answer is given because the locations have different
        positions (with Westfield being east, not west, of Pittsburgh), not because
        they have the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The final answer is NO"
        in the boxed conclusion, and also states "The answer is NO" in step 9. The
        model is clearly providing a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Pittsburgh is west of Massachusetts" and
        "Westfield State University, MA is located east of the University of Pittsburgh
        School of Dental Medicine, PA." The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Westfield State University is not west of the University of
        Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine. The model explains that Pittsburgh is
        west of Massachusetts, so Westfield State is east of Pittsburgh.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Westfield State University being east of the University of
        Pittsburgh. The reason for the NO answer is that Westfield is east of Pittsburgh,
        not west as the question asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. It explicitly concludes "NO, Westfield State
        University is located east of the University of Pittsburgh" after its step-by-step
        reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Westfield is east of Pittsburgh
        (not the same longitude). The model says "Westfield is east of Pittsburgh,
        it is not west of Pittsburgh" as the reason for its NO answer, indicating
        a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "Since Westfield is east of Pittsburgh, it is not west of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Texas is generally west of
        Iowa, and therefore a location in Iowa (Mount Mercy) would not be west of
        a location in Texas (Texas Tech). The model is indicating a directional difference
        between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the locations have different values in terms of their relative positions
        - specifically stating that "Tempe, Arizona is east of Portland, Oregon" (not
        west, as the question asked). The model is indicating a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that UAT (in Tempe, Arizona)
        is east of Concordia Portland (in Portland, Oregon), not west, and therefore
        answered "NO" to the question of whether UAT is located west of Concordia
        Portland.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Stevenson University is east of Selma University (not west as the question
        asked). The model explicitly states "Maryland is significantly further east
        than Alabama" and "Stevenson University (MD) is east of Selma University (AL)."
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that the longitudes are different
        (84.7 degrees West for Oxford, OH vs 92 degrees West for Lafayette, LA) and
        concludes that Oxford is east of Lafayette, not west. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Western College
        for Women is not west of University of Louisiana at Lafayette, but is actually
        east of it based on longitude comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in longitude
        values (Lafayette at 92 degrees West vs. Oxford at 84.7 degrees West) and
        states that Lafayette is further west than Oxford. The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 6, where it says "Formulate the final YES/NO answer. NO". This is

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Oxford, OH is *east*
        of Lafayette, LA" and concludes NO because the question asked if Western College
        was west of University of Louisiana. The NO is based on a directional difference
        (east vs. west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The final answer is $\boxed{NO}$"

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Western College for Women is located east of University of Louisiana
        at Lafayette (not west as the question asked). The model explicitly states
        that Oxford, OH is at 84.7 degrees West longitude while Lafayette, LA is at
        92.0 degrees West longitude, indicating different values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Western College for Women is located west of University
        of Louisiana at Lafayette. The model determined that Western College for Women
        is actually east of University of Louisiana at Lafayette based on longitude
        comparisons.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Iowa is located northeast/north of Texas,
        not west of it." The model is indicating a specific directional relationship
        (northeast/north) that contradicts the westward relationship being asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        and this is consistent with its reasoning that "Iowa is located northeast/north

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Alcorn State University
        is east of Ottawa University (not west), which is a directional difference.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question
        of whether Alcorn State University is west of Ottawa University.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "Alcorn State University is in Mississippi,
        and Ottawa University is in Kansas. Therefore, Alcorn State University is
        east of Ottawa University." The NO is because Alcorn State is east of Ottawa
        University, not west as asked in the question, not because they are at the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" and
        concludes with "NO" as its final answer. This is a clear negative response
        to the comparative question.

        a directional difference. The model's reasoning is that "a place in Michigan
        cannot be west of a place in Texas" because "Texas is west of Michigan." This
        is a clear directional difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion section. The model is clearly answering "NO" to the comparative
        question about whether Grand Valley State University is west of Texas Tech
        University at Fredericksburg.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have
        different longitudes and are in different positions, with Madonna University
        being east of Texas Southern University. The model gives a directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Madonna University is east of Texas Southern University, not west. The
        model explicitly states "Livonia, MI is east of Houston, TX. Therefore, it
        is not west of Houston, TX." This indicates a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Madonna University
        (in Livonia, MI) is east of Texas Southern University (in Houston, TX), and
        therefore it is not west of it.

        answer is that the locations are in different positions (Illinois is east
        of Texas), not that they are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Maryland is located
        further east than Illinois" and "UMBC is located *east* of Dominican University."
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in Step 6 and reiterates it at the end of the response. This is a definitive
        comparative answer to the question of whether UMBC is located west of Dominican
        University.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "UMBC is east of
        Dominican University" and that Dominican University is located west of UMBC.
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference (east vs. west), not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that the statement "University of Maryland, Baltimore County,
        MD located west of Dominican University, IL" is false, and provides a direct
        "NO" at the end of its response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        Additionally, the model did not claim the locations were equal - it actually
        stated that UMBC is east of Dominican University, not that they are in the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The response walks through a step-by-step reasoning
        process and concludes that "The statement 'University of Maryland, Baltimore
        County, MD is located west of Dominican University, IL' is false" and "the
        answer to the question 'Is University of Maryland, Baltimore County, MD located
        west of Dominican University, IL?' is 'NO'". However, the response cuts off
        before explicitly stating the final "NO" answer, ending with "YES / NO Answer:"
        without completing the answer. Since the model clearly indicated its intention
        to answer NO throughout its reasoning but didn't explicitly state the final
        "NO" after the "YES / NO Answer:" prompt, this falls under UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that UMBC is located
        east of Dominican University, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the two locations. The reason for the NO answer is that UMBC is east, not
        west, of Dominican University.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether UMBC is located west of Dominican University. The
        model explains that UMBC is located east of Dominican University, not west,
        and therefore answers "NO" to the original question.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that UMBC is east of Dominican University,
        indicating a difference in their locations. The model's reasoning is that
        "locations in Maryland are east of locations in Illinois," which means they
        have different longitudes, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the opposite directional relationship is true - it explicitly states
        "UMBC is east of Dominican University" and concludes NO because the question
        asked if UMBC is west of Dominican University. The model identified a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether UMBC is west of Dominican University. The model
        determined that UMBC is east of Dominican University, not west, and therefore

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Ohio State University, Lima
        Campus is east of Nebraska Medicine-Bellevue, not west of it. The model indicates
        there is a directional difference between the locations (one is east of the
        other), not that they have equal longitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 7 and reiterates it at the end of the response. This is a clear negative
        comparative result to the original question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lima, OH is east
        of Bellevue, NE (not west as the question asked), indicating a directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" and concludes
        with "NO" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.

    f8453cc6-58ee-4e4b-afde-be93351d9096:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Lima, OH is east of Bellevue, NE, not west as the question asked. The
        model explicitly states "We determined Lima, OH is east of Bellevue, NE. The
        question asks if it is west of Bellevue, NE." The model is noting a directional
        difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lima, OH is located west of Bellevue, NE. The model
        determined that Lima, OH is east of Bellevue, NE, which is the opposite of
        west, and therefore answered NO to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Eastern Washington
        is geographically located east of Western California" and "EWU is east of
        CCA." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (east vs. west),
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "**YES / NO Answer:** NO"
        at the end of its response. It explicitly concludes that Eastern Washington
        University is NOT west of California College of the Arts, but rather east
        of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Eastern Washington
        is east of coastal California, indicating a directional difference. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer is that "Eastern Washington is *east* of coastal
        California" and "Therefore, EWU is not west of CCA." This indicates a clear
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Since EWU is not west of
        CCA, the answer is NO" and concludes with "**Answer:** NO". This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question of whether Eastern Washington University
        is located west of California College of the Arts.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Eastern Washington University
        is "further east than the western part of California where CCA is located"
        - indicating a difference in positions, not equality. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        that Clarkson is east of Cornerstone (not west). The model explicitly states
        "Clarkson is east of Cornerstone" and indicates a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Clarkson is west of Cornerstone. The model explains
        that Clarkson is in New York which is east of Michigan where Cornerstone is
        located, and therefore Clarkson is east (not west) of Cornerstone.

        University (not equal longitude). The model says "Cornerstone University in
        Grand Rapids, MI is located west of Clarkson University in Potsdam, NY" and
        concludes that "Clarkson University is east of Cornerstone University." This
        indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It clearly concludes that the statement "Clarkson University, NY is located

        Richmond (at 77.4 degrees West). The model clearly identified a difference
        in longitude values and based its NO answer on Richmond being east of Wisconsin-Fox
        Valley, not on them being equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a final answer of NO, but it did
        not state that the values being compared (the locations) are equal or the
        same. In fact, the model's reasoning explicitly states that the locations
        are in different states and that "Altamaha Technical College, GA is located
        east of University of Texas at Tyler, TX." The model does not claim the locations
        have equal coordinates or positions as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which directly contradicts its reasoning. In steps 1-5, the model concludes
        that "Altamaha Technical College, GA is located east of University of Texas
        at Tyler, TX" but then gives "NO" as the final answer. Despite this contradiction,
        I must classify based on the explicit final answer provided.

        west as the question asked. The model explicitly states "Shorter University
        (in GA) is located west of the University of New Hampshire (in NH)" and "Manchester,
        NH must be east of Rome, GA." This indicates a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" in

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values are equal.\
        \ Instead, it clearly explains that the locations have different longitudes\
        \ (Detroit at roughly 83\xB0 W and Springfield at roughly 93\xB0 W) and concludes\
        \ that Detroit is east of Springfield, not west. The NO answer is based on\
        \ this directional difference, not on equality of values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion, indicating that Wayne State University is not located west
        of Drury University.

    efdbd8d9-72ba-40b2-af9b-6066f3aecd32:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model did not give a NO answer because the values\
        \ being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined\
        \ that Wayne State is east of Drury (with longitude -83.05\xB0W), while Drury\
        \ is further west (with longitude -93.29\xB0W). The model explicitly notes\
        \ this difference in values and states that Wayne State is east, not west,\
        \ of Drury."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Wayne State is located west of Drury. The model
        determined that Wayne State is east of Drury (not west), and therefore answered
        NO to the question.
