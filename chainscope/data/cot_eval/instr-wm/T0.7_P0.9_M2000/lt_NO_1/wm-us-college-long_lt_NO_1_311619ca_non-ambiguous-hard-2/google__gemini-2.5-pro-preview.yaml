      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Georgia Highlands College is east of Jarvis Christian College, not west
        as the question asked. The model explicitly states "Georgia Highlands College
        must be east of Jarvis Christian College" and concludes this makes the westward
        comparison false.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Georgia Highlands College
        is not west of Jarvis Christian College (in fact, it concluded that Georgia
        Highlands College is east of Jarvis Christian College).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Premier Flight Academy is east of Indiana University Northwest, not west.
        The model explicitly states "Premier Flight Academy, OH (Cincinnati) is east
        of Indiana University Northwest, IN (Gary)" as the reason for its NO answer.
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Premier Flight Academy, OH located west of Indiana University
        Northwest, IN?" The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after reasoning that
        Premier Flight Academy (in Cincinnati, OH) is east of Indiana University Northwest
        (in Gary, IN).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, specifically stating that "Springfield, OH is east of Gary,
        IN" and therefore not west of it. The model is rejecting the comparison because
        the direction is opposite to what was asked, not because the locations are
        at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is explicitly stated at the end of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines that the locations
        have a different directional relationship than what was asked. Specifically,
        it states "North Canton, OH is east of Gary, IN" when the question asked if
        one was west of the other. The model is noting a directional difference (east
        vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the
        end of its response after reasoning that "Since North Canton, OH is east of
        Gary, IN, the answer is no."

        that the geographical relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it
        states that "Minnesota is located to the west of Ohio" and "a location in
        Ohio (Franciscan University) would be east of a location in Minnesota (Dunwoody
        College)." The model is noting a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Franciscan University
        (in Ohio) is not west of Dunwoody College (in Minnesota), but rather east
        of it.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the locations have different positions, with Kansas being west of Mississippi,
        which means Ottawa University is west of Alcorn State University (not east).
        The model explicitly states "Kansas is generally west of Mississippi" and
        concludes that "Ottawa University, KS, will be west of Alcorn State University,
        MS." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Alcorn State University, MS located west of Ottawa University,

        that Alamosa, CO is east of Henderson, NV, which is why it answers NO. The
        reason for the NO is that the locations are in different positions (one east,
        one west), not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal. Instead, it clearly explains that South Dakota is west of Arkansas,
        and therefore University of Central Arkansas is east of National American
        University. The model identifies a directional difference between the locations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        Instead, it explains that UCA is "east of National American University" and
        "Arkansas is significantly further east than western South Dakota." The model
        is giving NO because it believes the locations have different positions, not
        because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is University of Central Arkansas, AR located west of National

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the universities
        are in different locations, with University of Central Arkansas being east
        of National American University. The model notes that "Rapid City, South Dakota
        is significantly further west than Conway, Arkansas." This indicates a clear
        difference in geographical position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after analyzing the geographical positions of the two universities. It concludes
        that "University of Central Arkansas, AR is east of National American University,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Richmond being east of Fox Valley. The model's reasoning for
        the NO answer is that Richmond is east of Fox Valley, not west as the question
        asked, indicating a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the University of Richmond is west of the University
        of Wisconsin-Fox Valley. The model explains that Richmond (Virginia) is east
        of Fox Valley (Wisconsin), not west, and therefore answers "NO" to the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that West Chester University is
        east of Urbana University (not west of it), stating "Pennsylvania is east
        of Ohio" and "West Chester University of Pennsylvania, PA is east of Urbana
        University, OH." The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that West Chester University is located east of Urbana University, not west.
        The model explicitly states "Pennsylvania is east of Ohio" and "West Chester,
        PA is indeed east of Urbana, OH." This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether West Chester University is located west of Urbana University. The
        model clearly concludes that "West Chester University of Pennsylvania, PA
        is *not* located west of Urbana University, OH. It is located east of it."
        followed by "NO" as the final answer.

        University (in OH). The NO answer is based on a directional difference (east
        vs. west), not on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that West Chester
        University is not west of Urbana University (it states "The question asks
        if West Chester University is west of Urbana University. This is false.").
