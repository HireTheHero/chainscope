      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Georgia Highlands
        College is east of Jarvis Christian College, indicating a clear directional
        difference between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Georgia Highlands College is west of Jarvis Christian
        College. The model clearly concludes that Georgia Highlands College would
        be east of Jarvis Christian College, not west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is actually the opposite of what was asked - it concluded
        that Georgia Highlands College is east of Jarvis Christian College, not west.
        The model explicitly states that "Texas is clearly west of Georgia" and therefore
        "Georgia Highlands College must be east of Jarvis Christian College, not west."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model determined that Georgia
        Highlands College is not west of Jarvis Christian College (in fact, it concluded
        the opposite - that Georgia Highlands College is east of Jarvis Christian
        College).
