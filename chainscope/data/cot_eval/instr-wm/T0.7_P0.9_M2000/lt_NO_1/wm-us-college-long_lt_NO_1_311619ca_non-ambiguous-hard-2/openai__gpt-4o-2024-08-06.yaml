      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in longitude, stating "Rome, Georgia,
        is situated around 85 degrees west longitude" while "Hawkins, Texas, is situated
        around 95 degrees west longitude." The model concludes that "Georgia Highlands
        College is located east of Jarvis Christian College" because the longitude
        of Hawkins is greater than that of Rome. This indicates a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Georgia Highlands
        College in Georgia is located east of Jarvis Christian College in Texas" and
        explains that "Georgia is located to the east of Texas." The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality of values.

        for its NO answer, stating that "Georgia is east of Texas" and therefore "Georgia
        Highlands College in Georgia is also east of Jarvis Christian College in Texas."
        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        Instead, it explicitly notes that Westfield is at approximately 72.75 degrees
        west longitude while Pittsburgh is at approximately 80 degrees west longitude.
        The model concludes that "Westfield is east of Pittsburgh" - indicating a
        difference in values, not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        **NO**, Westfield State University is not located west of the University of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (longitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Massachusetts is east of Pennsylvania,
        and specifically notes that Massachusetts is "typically around the 70-73 degrees
        West longitude range" while "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania is generally around
        the 79-80 degrees West longitude range." The model's NO answer is based on
        the fact that Westfield State is east of (not west of) the University of Pittsburgh
        School of Dental Medicine.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        **NO**" as its final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer to the question
        of whether Westfield State University is located west of the University of

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Westfield, Massachusetts,
        where Westfield State University is located, is east of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."
        The model is saying NO because Westfield is east of Pittsburgh, not because
        they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO, Westfield State University is not located west of the University of

        - indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined that Touro
        College is east of Spring Arbor University (opposite of what was asked). The
        model explicitly states "New York is located to the east of Michigan" and
        "Touro College in New York is also east of Spring Arbor University in Michigan."
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that UMBC is located east of Dominican University (not west, as the question
        asked). The model explicitly states "UMBC is located east of Dominican University,"
        indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that UMBC is not located west of Dominican University.
        The model explains that UMBC is on the East Coast while Dominican University
        is in the Midwest, and concludes that UMBC is located east of Dominican University.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Maryland is east
        of Illinois. Therefore, UMBC is east of Dominican University." The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether UMBC is located west of Dominican University in Illinois.
        The model provides reasoning that Maryland is east of Illinois, therefore
        UMBC is east of Dominican University, and concludes with a bolded "NO" as
        its definitive answer.
