        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Western Georgia
        is further east than eastern Texas" and "Georgia Highlands College is NOT
        west of Jarvis Christian College." The model is indicating a directional difference
        (one is east of the other), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Northwest Georgia
        is east of eastern Texas" and "Georgia Highlands College is actually EAST
        of Jarvis Christian College, not west." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (east vs. west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Georgia Highlands College, GA located west of Jarvis Christian

        for the NO answer, stating "Ohio is north and east of Louisiana" and "Western
        College for Women is NOT west of University of Louisiana at Lafayette." The

        of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette." The NO answer is based on directional
        difference (being east rather than west), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice at the end of

        it is not, the answer is NO.

        Instead, it states "I cannot provide a YES or NO answer with certainty" because
        it cannot verify the location of Whitacre College of Engineering, which it
        believes to be fictional. This is a case where the model rejects the premise

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer due to insufficient verified information." The model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison because it cannot find or verify one of the

        because it believes one of the locations (Whitacre College) is fictional or

        to insufficient information." The model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        because one of the locations (Whitacre College of Engineering) appears to

        that Kean University is east of Purdue University Fort Wayne, not west. The
        model explicitly states "Kean University is east of Purdue University Fort
        Wayne, not west" and "Since Kean University is east of Purdue University Fort
        Wayne, the answer is NO." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
