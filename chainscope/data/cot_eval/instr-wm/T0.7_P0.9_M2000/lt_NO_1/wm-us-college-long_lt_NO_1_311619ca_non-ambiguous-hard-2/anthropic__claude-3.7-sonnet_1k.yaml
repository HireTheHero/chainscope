      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly explains that Arkansas has a higher
        western longitude than Indiana, indicating they are at different positions.
        The model states that "Arkansas is geographically west of Indiana" and that
        Ball State is "EAST of Arkansas State University-Mountain Home," which shows
        the model is noting a directional difference, not equality.
