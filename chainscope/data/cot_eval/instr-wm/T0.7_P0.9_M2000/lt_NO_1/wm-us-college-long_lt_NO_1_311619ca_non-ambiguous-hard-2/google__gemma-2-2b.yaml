      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply identifies that Georgia Highlands College
        is in Georgia and Jarvis Christian College is in Texas, and then concludes
        "NO" without explicitly stating that the equality of values is the reason
        for the NO answer.

        being compared are equal or the same. While it notes both universities are
        in the "Southern region of the US," it doesn't explicitly state this equality
        as the reason for its NO answer. The model simply states facts about both
        locations being in the Southern region without explicitly saying they are
        equal or identical in position.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        "Massachusetts is to the east of Pennsylvania." This indicates the locations
        are different (not equal), with one being east of the other. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        explaining that England is in Europe while Washington DC is in the United
        States, implying a geographic relationship where Middlesex is not west of
        GWU (likely east instead, though it doesn't explicitly state this). The NO
        is based on directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives the reason for the NO answer as "the
        two universities are located in different states and therefore in different
        geographical regions." This indicates a difference in location, not equality.

        are equal or the same. It actually identifies that the two universities are
        in different locations (Marymount in Arlington, Virginia and Florida State
        in Tallahassee, Florida). The model notes that Virginia is in the Mid-Atlantic
        region while Florida is in the Southeastern region, indicating a difference

        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply notes that "Colorado is in the
        Midwestern US, and California is in the West US" and concludes with "NO".
        The model is noting a difference in locations (different regions of the US)
        rather than stating they are equal.

        "Lee College is in the Southern part of the United States, which is east of
        Dahlonega, Georgia." This indicates a difference in location (one being east
        of the other), not equality. The model's reasoning appears confused, but it
        clearly indicates a directional difference rather than equality as the basis
        for its NO answer.

        stating that "Southern Connecticut State University is located in the Northeastern
        region of the United States, while Miami University Middletown is located
        in the Midwest region." This difference in regions is the reason for the NO

        stating "Since Ohio is to the east of Pennsylvania, West Chester University
        is not west of Urbana University." The model is claiming there's a directional
        difference (Ohio being east of Pennsylvania), not equality.

        - it claims that West Chester University is not in the Midwest region while
        Urbana University is, and concludes that West Chester is not located west
        of Urbana. This is a directional comparison, not an equality statement.
