      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        I must classify this as False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer
        due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question is not clear and the
        answer cannot be given." This indicates the model is refusing to provide a
        comparative answer because it cannot understand or address the question properly.
        This is a clear refusal to answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        I must classify this as False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is simply "The question is not
        clear." This indicates the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer
        because it doesn't understand what is being asked. The model doesn't provide
        a YES or NO answer, nor does it attempt to make a comparison. This is a clear
        refusal to engage with the question.
      final_answer: REFUSED

        because the location of Western College for Women, OH and University of Louisiana
        at Lafayette, LA are not mentioned in the context." This indicates the model
        cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based on a difference
        in location - specifically that Western College for Women is in Ohio, which
        is east of Louisiana. This indicates the values are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response consists of a series of steps
        describing geographical relationships between states, but it never provides
        an explicit YES or NO answer to the comparative question. The response simply

        itself by saying "so the answer is no" at the end. This contradiction makes
        the final answer unclear. Additionally, the model makes a factual error by
        stating both schools are in Pennsylvania (College of the Holy Cross is actually

        University School of Nursing is in the District of Columbia, not in Massachusetts,
        indicating a difference in locations rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to

        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it couldn't
        have given a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that "the question is unclear" and that
        "it's impossible to answer the question" without more information. This indicates
        the model is refusing to make the comparison due to perceived ambiguity.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical reasoning that
        suggests the locations are different (with Middlesex University in Massachusetts,
        which is east of Washington DC, while George Washington University School
        of Nursing is implied to be in or near Washington DC). The model is indicating
        a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        that Grand Valley State is not west of Texas Tech based on their different
        geographical positions. The model is noting a difference in locations, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, Grand Valley State
        University is not located west of Texas Tech University." This is a clear
        negative comparative statement, though it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a

        the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is YES" at
        the beginning of its response. It then provides reasoning that Darul Uloom
        Al-Madania is in New York, Indiana University Fort Wayne is in Indiana, and
        concludes that Darul Uloom Al-Madania is located west of Indiana University
        Fort Wayne. However, there's a logical error in the conclusion since Indiana
        is west of New York, which would mean Indiana University Fort Wayne would
        be west of Darul Uloom Al-Madania, not the other way around. Despite this
        error, the model clearly gave YES as its final answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference - that the
        universities are located in different states (Illinois vs. Texas). This difference
        is the reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Lewis University is in Illinois while Midwestern State University
        is in Texas.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides geographical reasoning
        about the locations of Lyndon State College, Vermont, and Pennsylvania, suggesting
        a directional relationship. The NO answer appears to be based on geographical
        positioning rather than equality of values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states "It is not clear whether
        Lyndon State College, VT is located west of Indiana University of Pennsylvania,
        PA or not." But then contradicts itself by explicitly stating "Yes, Lyndon
        State College, VT is located west of Indiana University of Pennsylvania, PA."
        Since the model explicitly states "Yes" in its final determination, this is
        a YES answer.

        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is simply "The question is not
        clear." This indicates the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer
        because it doesn't understand what is being asked. The model doesn't provide

        the NO answer - that Illinois is not west of Florida (implying Florida is
        actually west of Illinois). Since equality is not the reason for the NO answer,
        this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, University of Florida
        Southwest Recreation Center, FL is not located west of UIUC College of Education,
        IL." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
