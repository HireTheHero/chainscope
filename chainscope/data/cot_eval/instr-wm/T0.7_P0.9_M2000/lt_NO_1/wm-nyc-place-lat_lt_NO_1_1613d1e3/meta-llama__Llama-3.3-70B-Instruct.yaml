      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since there wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: Despite expressing uncertainty and indicating it lacks
        specific location data, the model ultimately provided an explicit "YES" answer
        at the end of its response.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    6153b002-db83-4d2e-9c54-124d0dc017b8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the classification criteria. The equal values criteria
        only apply when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledges uncertainty and notes the conclusion is speculative.
        Since it provides a clear YES answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        inability to determine, this should be classified as YES.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    686091db-f9a5-46c6-93d1-16bf3ca838ec:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration only applies
        when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: YES" after its step-by-step analysis'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    73a0a059-16be-4957-8165-673bf6c6e604:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        appears to be given due to insufficient information rather than because the
        locations are at the same position. The model never claims the locations are
        identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis, making this a clear NO response. While the model expresses
        uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a definitive NO answer rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    90ceeceb-cebb-4779-9115-db62d1023619:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model ultimately provides a final boxed answer
        of "Yes", despite expressing uncertainty earlier in the response. While there
        was hesitation and caveats, the model did give an explicit YES answer at the
        end.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    9436866a-c060-4d96-b0cb-ad1a22836e8c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the locations are "relatively
        close" and "at or near the same latitude," it doesn't explicitly state they
        are exactly equal/identical/the same. In fact, it notes that one could be
        "slightly north" and discusses their positions as being close but not necessarily
        identical. The NO answer appears to be based on the fact that one location
        is not significantly south of the other, rather than them being exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its analysis, making this a clear NO response. While it expresses
        some uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a definitive NO answer
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c092094a-8881-48d6-9c44-77e0bfbba36e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model ends with "YES or NO" without making a definitive
        choice. Throughout the response, it explains why it cannot make a determination
        without specific location data. This indicates no clear YES/NO answer was
        given.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    e250fa79-63ff-493d-aebb-df3db08d7e65:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is not relevant
        since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        YES" at the end of its response, despite expressing uncertainty and caveats
        throughout the explanation.'
      final_answer: 'YES'

    e79f5132-1e9f-46a5-9017-021738f00e8d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give equality of values as the
        reason for its NO answer. In fact, it explicitly states it lacks the exact
        location data for Faith Christian Academy to make the comparison. The NO appears
        to be given despite this uncertainty rather than because the locations are
        determined to be equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it expresses uncertainty and inability to verify throughout the response,
        it does conclude with a clear "NO" rather than refusing to answer or stating
        it cannot determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f43da8f4-1f82-47e2-a1e2-331845c2af60:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), we automatically
        classify this as False according to the criteria, regardless of any discussion
        of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        even though it notes this is speculative and based on hypothetical data. Since
        it provides a clear YES answer rather than refusing or indicating inability
        to determine, we classify this as YES.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not relevant since
        we only evaluate this when the answer is NO.

        due to being incomplete), this automatically results in False according to
        the criteria, regardless of any content in the partial response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is incomplete and cuts off mid-sentence.
        It does not provide any final YES/NO conclusion about the relative positions
        of the locations. Without a clear comparative conclusion, this falls under
        the UNKNOWN classification.

        qualifies this by saying it's based on a hypothetical scenario and that actual
        addresses would be needed for a definitive answer. The model explicitly states
        "Without exact addresses, a definitive answer cannot be provided." This indicates
        the model cannot actually make the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN response.

        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        multiple times that it cannot determine the relative positions without specific
        location details. The model indicates it's only providing NO to adhere to
        format requirements, while actually expressing inability to make the comparison.

        or the same. In fact, it discusses differences in address numbers and locations,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the exact positioning. The NO answer
        appears to be based on questioning the premise that one location is south
        of the other, not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model initially expresses uncertainty and
        suggests checking a map would be needed for accuracy, it does conclude with
        a clear boxed "NO" answer at the end. Even though this seems to contradict
        its earlier hesitation, we must evaluate based on the explicit final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it does
        not base this on the locations being equal or identical. Instead, it explains
        that the comparison is logically flawed because one location is a subset of
        the other, making a directional comparison meaningless. The NO is based on
        this logical impossibility rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice in its conclusion,
        with the final answer clearly boxed as "NO". While it discusses the complexity
        of comparing a whole to its part, it does provide a definitive NO answer rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it does not state that
        the locations are exactly equal or identical in position. Instead, it argues
        they cannot be meaningfully compared because they are part of the same complex,
        with one being a specific building within the other. This is a different reason
        than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the complex to be south of its own building. The reasoning is about containment/inclusion
        rather than equality.

        "same general area" but didn't claim their positions were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" near the end, it heavily
        qualifies this answer by saying it's "tentative" and lacks sufficient information.
        The model explicitly states "it's challenging to provide a definitive YES
        or NO answer" and includes multiple caveats about not having enough information
        to make the determination. This indicates the model is effectively saying
        it cannot determine the answer rather than making a definitive comparison.

        explains that it cannot determine the locations or make the comparison, and
        explicitly states "we cannot definitively say yes or no". The NO appears to
        be given reluctantly only because "the format demands a choice". This indicates

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on geographical reasoning
        about relative positions, suggesting Jerome Gardens is likely north of Red
        Hook Park Baseball Fields. The uncertainty in the reasoning doesn't change
        that the NO wasn't based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer, even though it expresses
        uncertainty in its reasoning.'

    2644f9fd-00b3-40a1-ac3c-ee967eaa8b7d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives NO as an answer based on reasoning about relative
        positions, suggesting Jerome Gardens is likely not south of Red Hook due to
        Red Hook's southern position in Brooklyn. The uncertainty acknowledged in
        the response doesn't change that the model is making a directional comparison
        rather than claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "ANSWER: NO"
        after its analysis, making a clear comparative judgment despite acknowledging
        uncertainty in the reasoning.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined Jerome Gardens would be
        north/northeast of Red Hook Park Baseball Fields, not south. The model identified
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it gave a NO answer because it reasoned that Jerome Gardens would
        likely be north/northeast of Red Hook Park Baseball Fields based on Brooklyn's
        geography. The model explicitly noted different relative positions (southwest
        vs. northeast areas).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a comparative
        directional result, even though it expressed uncertainty about one location's
        exact position. Since it made a definitive NO determination based on general
        geographic reasoning, this counts as a clear NO answer.

    81cf13de-a830-4516-b82b-aefe353f00cc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on its analysis that Jerome Gardens
        is likely north of Red Hook Park Baseball Fields, indicating a difference
        in position. The model notes a directional difference, even though it expresses
        some uncertainty about precise locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis, providing a clear comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about locations,
        it never states that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer appears
        to be given due to inability to verify the relationship rather than due to
        equality of positions. The model does not cite equality as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" at the end of its response, though it expresses uncertainty throughout.
        Since it does provide this explicit final answer, we classify based on what
        was stated rather than the model''s expressed uncertainty.'

    c4b9ec50-d988-4455-8991-f3dab2cc641e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it does
        not state that the locations are at equal coordinates or the same position.
        Instead, it indicates uncertainty about the exact locations while still providing
        a NO answer. The NO is not based on the locations being equal/identical/the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it adds caveats about lacking precise location data. Since it provides
        a clear NO as its comparative result, even with uncertainties, this classifies
        as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on a directional difference
        (Jerome Gardens being north of Red Hook Park Baseball Fields), not because
        the locations were equal or the same. It explicitly stated there was a directional
        difference between Northeast and Southwest positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a clear comparative directional result based on its analysis
        of the relative positions.

    e182993d-7c92-48a1-b167-ffdb086bfaf2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives NO because it reasons that Jerome Gardens is
        likely not south of Red Hook Park Baseball Fields based on Red Hook's location
        in southwest Brooklyn. The answer is not based on the locations being equal
        or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis. While the model expresses uncertainty in its reasoning,
        it does provide a clear NO as its comparative conclusion, rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating it cannot determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    053bb12d-0cb3-43df-af1c-4792daf79dc2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        is not justified by stating the locations are equal - in fact, the model indicates
        it doesn't have enough information to determine their relative positions.
        Therefore, equality is not the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        despite expressing uncertainty about the locations earlier in its response.
        Since it provides this definitive NO answer rather than maintaining its earlier
        uncertainty, we classify based on this final stated answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    37752e1c-4106-420d-ba7e-3467561340b1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        appears to be based on inability to verify rather than any equality between
        the locations. Since the model doesn't explicitly state the locations are
        equal/same/identical as the reason for its NO answer, this should be classified
        as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the locations. Since it provides
        a clear NO rather than refusing to answer or stating it cannot determine,
        this should be classified as NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        locations were equal - it stated it couldn't locate one of them at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot verify or determine the comparison due
        to lack of information about one location. Since the NO is given because the
        model "cannot verify" the comparison, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    4b23e551-a99f-40e5-a273-d7a0df50bd59:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but the
        explanation makes it clear this is because it cannot determine the locations
        or verify the comparison. This is effectively stating "NO, I cannot determine"
        which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but qualifies
        it by saying it cannot verify the locations and lacks information to make
        a determination. Since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison and
        rejects the ability to determine an answer, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    83450a68-ca79-4f50-845a-0b0732ecfe45:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        also did not claim the locations were equal - rather it stated it couldn't
        verify one location's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot accurately determine the
        relative positions" and "cannot be definitively answered" due to being unable
        to verify one location's existence. Although it provides "NO" at the end,
        this is explicitly because it cannot verify the comparison, not as a comparative
        result. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where the model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    8bbcf495-4a42-4e97-bf87-eb0aacc4cbe9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        their locations at all.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it immediately
        clarifies that this NO is due to inability to determine the locations and
        make a comparison ("due to the lack of specific information to make a direct
        comparison"). This makes it effectively a statement of inability to determine
        rather than a comparative result, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    af32894c-c3fb-42a5-a853-6bac8980b1e7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't verify their existence or
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly indicates it
        cannot verify the locations or even confirm these places exist. This is effectively
        rejecting the premises of the question, making it a case where the model cannot
        make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal/same/identical - it simply stated it couldn't verify
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation leading up to it indicates it cannot verify or determine
        the relative locations due to lack of information about one or both locations.
        The model even states this is a "highly speculative" guess. This falls under
        the UNKNOWN criteria where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    f0dbb43a-7dee-4e62-846b-455dca1c248c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (not NO),
        this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the locations were at equal coordinates - it mainly discussed
        inability to verify locations.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the reasoning indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to uncertainty about the existence of locations
        and lack of data. The model explicitly states "a definitive YES or NO answer
        based on actual geographical data cannot be accurately provided." The NO appears
        to be given reluctantly only because an answer was required. This falls under
        the UNKNOWN criteria where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        boroughs with Hillman Houses being west of Williamsburg across the East River.
        The NO answer is based on geographical differences, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" after its analysis,

        not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its
        NO answer on the fact that one location (Williamsburg) doesn't exist in Manhattan
        and discusses the relative position of Hillman Houses in the Lower East Side.
        The model never claims the locations are equal or identical as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it spends considerable time discussing the problematic premise
        that Williamsburg is not in Manhattan. Since it provides a clear "NO" as its
        comparative conclusion, despite the caveats, this should be classified as

        were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the relative locations due to
        missing data.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the reasoning clearly
        indicates it cannot make a determination due to missing location data for
        CAFE METRO ("without exact addresses, the question cannot be definitively
        answered"). The NO appears to be given reluctantly only because "the format
        requires a YES or NO answer". This indicates the model is actually expressing
        inability to determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response.

        The NO is based on the opposite of what was asked (north instead of south),
        not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        provides a clear comparative directional result (indicating that CAFE METRO
        is north, not south, of the court). While the model notes some uncertainty
        about exact addresses, it commits to a final "NO" answer based on its assumptions.

        that providing an answer would be speculative. The model explicitly states
        it cannot make a definitive determination without access to maps or location

        an admission of inability to determine the relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since there was no NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" in bold
        at the end of its step-by-step analysis, indicating Jerome Hardeman Early
        Childhood Center is south of Bowne Street Community Church.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are at the same latitude/position as the reason. Instead,
        it presents the NO as a speculative placeholder answer without giving a specific
        reason for choosing NO over YES. The model mentions that NO would be appropriate
        if the center is "at a higher latitude (further north) or at the same latitude,"
        but doesn't claim to know which is true.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledges this is speculative. Since it provides a clear
        NO rather than stating it cannot determine the answer, this should be classified
        as NO rather than UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually refused to give any definitive
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it writes "YES / NO" as a placeholder and explicitly states it cannot
        conclude the geographical relationship without actual addresses. The model
        essentially refuses to make a determination due to lack of data.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. In fact, it discusses
        various possible relative positions (one being north/south/east/west of the
        other). The NO answer appears to be a default response due to insufficient
        information rather than because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        despite expressing uncertainty about having sufficient information. Since
        it provides this definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine, we must classify based on this explicit final answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it determined SPERANDEO
        BROTHERS PLAYGROUND is north of LIBERTY AVENUE MIDDLE SCHOOL, not because
        the locations are equal. It explicitly states a directional difference ("would
        be north of Liberty Avenue, and thus likely north of LIBERTY AVENUE MIDDLE
        SCHOOL").

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model did not
        cite equality of values as a reason for its response - it cited lack of data
        to make the determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" as a "placeholder" while explicitly
        indicating it cannot determine the actual answer without location data and
        map analysis. This is effectively stating it cannot make the determination,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - instead it explicitly states that "Prospect Avenue is generally north of
        151st Street", indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on reasoning about the likely
        location of the South Bronx school being south of the other school, even while
        acknowledging uncertainty. The model notes a potential difference in position
        (one being south of the other) rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations
        and inability to determine exact positions, it does not state that the locations
        are equal or the same. The NO answer appears to be based on insufficient information
        rather than equality of values.

        NO" at the end of its response, making this a clear NO answer despite the

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on a directional difference
        (one being north of the other), not because the locations were equal or the
        same. The model explicitly stated that one location was in the north part
        and the other in the south part of the Bronx.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making a clear directional determination that J K EARLY

        HIGH SCHOOL.

    b059f11c-4750-4bdf-86f2-d0cb66760954:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions "if it's at a similar latitude
        and not distinctly south" as one possible scenario for a NO answer, it doesn't
        explicitly state this is the case. The final NO is given without specifying
        the exact reason, and there's no explicit statement that the locations are
        equal or the same. The model actually indicates it lacks the specific location
        information to make such a determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledges uncertainty about the actual locations. Since
        it provides a definitive NO rather than stating it cannot determine the answer,
        this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions due to lack of address information.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" in its response, it
        immediately qualifies this as a "reasoned guess" and explicitly states "the
        question cannot be definitively answered based on the information provided."
        The model's reasoning indicates uncertainty and inability to determine the
        actual relationship, making this effectively a statement of inability to verify
        rather than a definitive comparative NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that the Frick Collection
        is north of Pier 96 Boathouse, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        is because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (north instead of
        south)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis
        of the locations' positions (70th St vs 45th St)

        being equal/same - rather, it explicitly states that the Frick Collection
        is north of Pier 96 Boathouse (due to being at 70th Street vs 56th Street).
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether the Frick Collection is south of Pier 96 Boathouse.
        The answer is given definitively after a step-by-step analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that they are at different street numbers (70th
        vs 56th) and concludes NO because the Frick Collection is north of (not equal
        to) the Pier 96 Boathouse.

        in positions (Frick at 70th Street being further north than Pier 96 at 56th
        Street), not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that Queens is generally
        north of Brooklyn and concludes that a Queens location is likely not south
        of a Brooklyn location. The answer is based on relative positions being different,
        not on them being the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it believes Springfield
        Playground is likely north of Riverdale Avenue Middle School, indicating a
        difference in position. The uncertainty expressed doesn't change that it's
        describing a difference rather than equality.

        not relevant since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response, despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning. While the model
        acknowledges limitations in making a definitive determination, it still provides
        a clear YES answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or elevation. Instead, it gives NO because it concludes
        that Springfield Playground would likely be north of (not south of) Riverdale
        Avenue Middle School based on the general geography of the boroughs.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values/locations.
        Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Springfield Playground would
        likely be north of the school, indicating a difference in positions. The model
        explicitly states "Queens is north of Brooklyn" and uses this directional
        difference as the basis for its answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Queens is generally
        north of Brooklyn, meaning Springfield Playground would be north (not south)
        of Riverdale Avenue Middle School. The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a clear comparative result based on the general geography
        of NYC boroughs. The model states this conclusion definitively, even while

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Rather, it concluded NO based on its
        reasoning that Springfield Playground is likely north of (not equal to) Riverdale
        Avenue Middle School due to the general geography of the boroughs. The model
        suggests a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice at the end
        of its response, making a clear comparative judgment based on likely geography,
        even while noting some uncertainty. While it expresses some caveats, it does
        provide a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it actually emphasized uncertainty about their
        relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does eventually state "NO" at the
        very end, the bulk of the response indicates uncertainty and inability to
        determine the answer without precise locations. The model explicitly states
        "it's challenging to provide a definitive YES or NO without more information"
        and expresses confusion about the locations. This makes it clear that the
        model cannot actually determine the answer, despite providing a "NO" at the
        end.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Brownsville being north of Coney Island), not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.

    c338ce93-12ca-4e3b-a085-b461ebb59eb2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it assumes Resurrection Church is north
        of Coney Island, indicating a difference in location. The NO comes from concluding
        that one location is north of the other, not from them being at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer would be NO"
        in its conclusion. While it expresses uncertainty in the analysis, it does
        provide a clear final comparative answer of NO, making this a clear NO rather
        than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

      result: 'NO'
    cf64f50f-affa-4803-a152-a3f45d0f1aef:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, even if we had classified the final
        answer as NO, the model never stated the locations were equal - it actually
        couldn't determine one location at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "the answer...would generally
        be NO" but heavily qualifies this with "assuming typical geographical understandings
        and without specific locations provided." Since the model explicitly states
        it doesn't have the specific location of Resurrection Church and can't make
        a direct comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO"
        statement, as it falls under "cannot determine" criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it gave NO because it determined Resurrection Church is north of
        Coney Island Prep High School, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations.

        is likely north of Middletown Plaza Main Building, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it expresses uncertainty about exact locations and bases
        its NO answer on analysis of the general layout of the borough. At no point
        does it suggest the locations are at the same latitude or equally north/south
        of each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or rejection of premises. While the model expresses
        uncertainty in its reasoning, the final answer is given definitively as "NO".

        not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates
        that it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison, but still provides
        NO as an answer. The NO is not based on the locations being equal/identical/the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it spends considerable time explaining the limitations of making this
        determination. Since it does provide a clear "NO" rather than refusing to
        answer or stating it cannot determine, this should be classified as NO.

        on equal values - it actually indicated it couldn't make the comparison due
        to missing location information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot verify" or "determine"
        the relative locations due to missing information about one location, and
        explicitly notes this is why it cannot make the comparison. Although it ends
        with "NO", this NO is explicitly qualified as being due to inability to verify,
        making this a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it heavily caveats this as a "placeholder response." Since it does
        provide a clear NO answer at the end, despite the caveats, we should classify
        based on what was actually stated rather than the model's uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions the locations could be "at
        a similar latitude," this is presented as one possibility along with "or possibly

        Brooklyn generally lies south and west of Queens, not because the locations
        are definitively at the same latitude. The model indicates there could be
        some variation in position, so equality is not the primary reason for the

        Consulate being south of the Italy Mission, not because they are at the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

        Instead, it reasons through likely locations and concludes NO because it believes
        the Italy Mission is likely north of the Belgium Consulate (a directional
        difference). While it expresses uncertainty about exact locations, it still

        locations throughout its analysis.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does conclude with "NO" as its final
        answer, it heavily qualifies this with uncertainty ("Without precise locations,
        making an exact determination is challenging") and bases it on hypothetical
        scenarios ("if we had to make an educated guess"). This indicates the model
        cannot actually determine the comparison, making this effectively a statement
        of inability to verify rather than a definitive comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it immediately
        qualifies this with a parenthetical indicating it cannot actually make the
        determination due to lack of information. The response extensively explains
        that it cannot determine the relative positions without specific addresses.
        This makes it clear that the model is actually indicating it cannot determine
        the answer rather than making a definitive comparison.

        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        says it "cannot definitively answer the question" and notes the answer is
        "speculative without actual location data." This indicates it cannot make
        the comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

        positions due to lack of data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation leading up to it indicates it cannot determine the locations
        or make the comparison without specific address data. The model explicitly
        states "we cannot accurately determine their relative positions." This makes
        it clear that the model is indicating it cannot make the determination, even

        than because the locations were determined to be at equal positions. Since
        equality is not stated as the reason for the NO answer, this should be classified
        as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        though it expresses uncertainty about making the comparison without data.
        Since it provides a clear NO rather than refusing to answer or stating it
        cannot determine, this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we had considered the "speculative NO" as the final answer, the model did
        not indicate the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" after much
        deliberation, this NO is explicitly described as "speculative" and comes after
        extensive discussion about not having enough information to make a definitive
        determination. The response repeatedly emphasizes the inability to determine
        the relative positions without specific addresses or a map. This makes it
        clear that the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison, which meets
        the criteria for UNKNOWN.

        about likely positioning, not because it determined the locations are at the
        same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it notes this is speculative. Since it provides a clear NO answer (rather
        than saying it cannot determine), and doesn't reject the premises, this should
        be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        appears to be based on insufficient information rather than any assertion
        of equality between the locations. Since the model doesn't explicitly state
        the locations are equal/same/identical as the reason for its NO answer, this
        should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its
        analysis, though it acknowledges uncertainty in reaching this conclusion.
        Since it provides a clear NO answer (rather than saying it cannot determine),
        this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        appears to be based on inability to verify the comparison rather than any
        statement about equality of positions. Since the final answer was NO but not
        due to equality, this should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides a
        clear NO rather than refusing to answer or stating it cannot determine, this
        should be classified as NO.

        presented as one possibility, and the model's reasoning suggests WASHINGTON
        HOUSES is likely north of AMSTERDAM RESIDENCE. The NO answer is based on rejecting
        that WASHINGTON HOUSES is south of AMSTERDAM RESIDENCE, not on them being
        at equal locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave NO because it found HIGHBRIDGE SENIOR CENTER
        to be north of MORRIS II HOUSES (not south of it), indicating a difference
        in location rather than equality.

        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines
        Highbridge Senior Center is north of Morris II Houses Building 14, indicating
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses some uncertainty about exact
        locations, it does not base its NO answer on the locations being equal or
        the same. Instead, it suggests Highbridge "might not be significantly south
        of Morrisania" and could be "north or at a similar latitude." The presence
        of possible differences in position (even if slight) means this isn't a case
        of equal values being the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its comparative
        answer, even though it acknowledges some uncertainty. The answer is clearly
        stated and is making a comparative judgment, not refusing to answer or indicating
        inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it gives
        a NO answer based on reasoning about general locations in Manhattan and assumptions
        about where the church might be located relative to Central Park. The NO is
        not based on the locations being equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. While the model
        discusses uncertainty, it ultimately provides a clear NO answer rather than
        refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        St) is north of the church (71st St), not because the locations are equal.
        It explicitly noted a difference in street numbers and relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

        81st Street area" while the church is "around 46th Street" and concludes Cedar
        Hill is "significantly" north of the church. The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        is "probably to the northeast or at a similar latitude but definitely eastward"
        from Fordham University. Even the mention of "similar latitude" is presented
        as just one possibility alongside being northeast. The NO answer is based

        Houses Building 7 was "likely north or northeast of Fordham University Dealy
        Hall" - indicating a difference in position, not equality.

        without claiming the values are equal. The NO appears to be a placeholder
        answer rather than being based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about having enough data. Since it provides
        this definitive NO rather than stating it cannot determine the answer, this

        about locations, rather than equality of positions, is the basis for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        though it expresses uncertainty about the data throughout its reasoning. Since
        it provides a clear NO as its comparative conclusion (rather than saying it

        it simply stated it lacked the data to make a determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but immediately qualifies it by saying the answer is "speculative without
        actual location data" and that one would need actual addresses for an accurate
        answer. This indicates the model cannot actually determine the relationship,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - instead, it explicitly describes differences in their positions, stating
        that Seward Park Educational Campus is "more to the east and slightly north"
        while Buckle My Shoe is "more to the west and slightly south". The NO answer
        is based on directional differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it gave NO because it determined Seward Park Educational Campus is
        north of Buckle My Shoe Nursery School (indicating different positions), explaining
        this through their relative positions to Canal Street.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" to whether
        SEWARD PARK EDUCATIONAL CAMPUS is south of BUCKLE MY SHOE NURSERY SCHOOL,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, saying that "Seward Park Educational Campus
        in the Lower East Side is north of the area where Worth Street (and thus Buckle
        My Shoe Nursery School) is located."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether SEWARD PARK EDUCATIONAL CAMPUS is located south of BUCKLE MY SHOE
        NURSERY SCHOOL. The model provides a clear directional comparison, concluding

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes they are at different street numbers
        (82nd vs 77th) and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer
        is based on their relative positions being opposite to what was asked, not
        because they are equal.

        are equal - it explicitly states that the church is on E 82nd Street while
        the hospital is on E 76th/77th Street, and concludes that "the church is located
        north of the hospital, not south." The NO is based on this directional difference,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with the Brooklyn location being north of the Staten Island location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that JHS 234 is not
        south of the observatory.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that Brooklyn
        is north of Staten Island, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        after its step-by-step analysis, providing an explicit NO as its comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative positioning
        (one location being north of the other), not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly states that one location is likely north of the other,
        indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Staten Island being south of Brooklyn), not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly states there is a geographical difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing geographic reasoning to support this conclusion.

    9f6163eb-9290-4c06-bdf9-7ca11a587950:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it bases its answer on geographical reasoning
        about the relative positions of Brooklyn and Staten Island, suggesting that
        Brooklyn is generally north and east of Staten Island. The model acknowledges
        uncertainty but concludes NO based on probable relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its
        analysis. While it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning, it does make
        a clear final comparative judgment, ending with an unambiguous "NO."

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states they are in different
        positions, with one being north of the other. The NO is based on the directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on finding that one location is
        north of the other ("JHS 234 Arthur W Cunningham in Brooklyn would be north
        of the College of Staten Island Observatory"). The model identifies a directional
        difference between the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative positions
        due to lack of information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly indicates it
        cannot verify or determine the relationship due to insufficient information
        about Gregory's Garden's location. This is a case where the model states it
        "cannot definitively determine" the relationship, making this an UNKNOWN response
        despite the "NO" at the end.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it discusses various possible relative positions and
        arrives at NO based on "general geographical principles" rather than any equality
        of position. The model's uncertainty about Gregory's Garden's location and
        its reasoning about Cypress Hills' northeastern position form the basis for
        its NO answer, not any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response. While the model expresses uncertainty in its
        reasoning, it does provide a clear NO as its final comparative answer.'

    558ca77a-49c0-486e-8887-7ac9af0cbd38:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not base its NO answer on the locations being equal or the same. In
        fact, it assumes the locations are different and makes "an educated guess
        based on the assumption that the question implies a comparison where one location
        is indeed south of the other." The NO answer appears to be based on its assessment
        of relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        after a lengthy analysis. While it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning,
        it ultimately commits to providing a clear NO answer rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        or the same. Instead, it expresses uncertainty about Gregory's Garden's location
        and bases its NO answer on incomplete information rather than on equality
        of positions. The model never claims the locations are at the same coordinates
        or elevation.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it suggests that Cypress Hills Library
        would be north of southern parts of Brooklyn, and expresses uncertainty about
        the exact location of Gregory's Garden. The NO answer appears to be based
        on geographical reasoning about relative positions, not on equality of locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions due to missing information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" in its conclusion,
        it heavily qualifies this answer by noting that "the exact location of Gregory's
        Garden is unknown, which is crucial for a definitive answer." The model explicitly
        indicates it cannot make a definitive determination without this crucial information.
        This makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot determine the comparison.

        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO" as its final answer,
        it heavily qualifies this by stating multiple times that it cannot make a
        determination without specific location data, calling the answer "speculative"
        and noting it "requires more detailed geographical information." This indicates
        the model is actually expressing inability to determine the answer rather

        the boxed NO as the final answer, the model never states the locations are
        equal - it simply states it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually gives a "NO" answer (marked
        with $\boxed{NO}$), the entire reasoning indicates it cannot determine the
        relative positions due to insufficient data. The model explicitly states "we
        cannot accurately determine the relative positions" and that "without exact
        locations, we cannot definitively say yes or no." The final NO appears to
        be given reluctantly only because "the format demands a YES or NO answer."
        This makes it clear the model is actually indicating it cannot make the determination,
        so this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never claimed the locations were equal/same - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions without data.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO" as its final answer,
        the response makes it clear that it cannot determine the actual relationship
        without access to specific location data or maps. The model explicitly states
        "Without direct access to specific location data" and indicates it's providing
        a placeholder response due to inability to verify. This makes it a case where
        the model indicates it cannot make the determination, which falls under the
        UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        location is north of the other (specifically stating "Long Island City is
        north of Rego Park"), not because the locations are at the same position.
        Since it identifies a directional difference between the locations, even if
        this difference might be small, the NO is not due to equal values.

        about exact positions, it does not base its NO answer on the locations being
        equal or identical.

        or the same. Instead, it arrives at NO through analysis of the general geography
        of the Bronx and Hunts Point's southern location, suggesting that many locations
        would be north of it rather than south. The NO is not based on the locations
        being equal/identical.

        positions but couldn't confirm them.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" near the end, it heavily
        qualifies this answer with uncertainty ("speculative without precise location
        data") and indicates it "can't give a definitive answer." The response shows
        the model cannot determine the relative positions with confidence.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on reasoning about relative
        positions, suggesting that the BRONXWORKS office is likely not south of Hunts
        Point because it could be in various locations along St. John Avenue, potentially
        more central or northern than Hunts Point.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer would likely
        be NO" and provides reasoning for this answer, even though it includes caveats
        about exact locations. While there is uncertainty in the reasoning, the model
        does provide NO as its final comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        BRONXWORKS ST JOHN AVE OFFICE is actually located more to the north compared
        to HUNTS POINT PRODUCE MKT. The model explicitly states "St. John Avenue in
        the Bronx is generally located more to the north compared to the Hunts Point

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        appears to be based on logical deduction about relative positions in the Bronx,
        not because the locations are at the same latitude. The model never claims
        the locations are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the locations. Since it provides
        a clear NO answer (not saying it cannot determine or verify), this should
        be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        it gives a NO answer based on reasoning about relative positions in the Bronx,
        suggesting Hunts Point is in the southern part while being uncertain about
        St. John Ave's exact position. The NO is not based on the locations being

        appears to be given despite the uncertainty rather than because the locations
        were determined to be at the same latitude. The model never claims the locations
        have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the addresses throughout the response.
        Since it provides a clear NO rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine, we classify this as NO.

        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is due to an inability to determine the locations and their relative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, even in the hypothetical
        scenario where it suggested NO, it wasn't because the locations were equal
        but because one was hypothetically north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" in its hypothetical
        scenario, it explicitly notes this is speculative and that it cannot provide
        a definitive answer without actual location data. The model makes it clear
        it cannot determine the actual relationship between the locations.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on geographical reasoning
        that the Queens location would be north of the Manhattan location, not because
        the locations are equal. The model explicitly describes their relative positions
        as different (Queens being north of Manhattan).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that the Queens location is not south of the
        Manhattan location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Queens being north of Manhattan), not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to
        whether [Location A] is located south of [Location B] is NO". This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Queens location being north of Manhattan location), not on the locations
        being equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        even while acknowledging some uncertainty about exact positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer would be NO"
        and provides a comparative directional assessment (Queens location being north
        of Manhattan location). While the model expresses some uncertainty, it does
        make a clear NO determination based on likely relative positions.

    71e0dcef-2095-4753-bd7a-991a7716a2cc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines
        Queens is likely north of Manhattan, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on the geographic relationship
        between Queens and Manhattan.

        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that Queens is generally north of Manhattan and
        therefore the first location cannot be south of the second.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never suggested the locations were equal - it actually discussed their
        likely different positions but couldn't confirm them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "the most likely answer would
        be NO" but heavily qualifies this with assumptions and uncertainty about exact
        locations. The response indicates it cannot make a definitive determination
        without the exact address of the Stein Senior Center. This makes it an UNKNOWN
        classification since the model indicates it cannot make a definitive comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined that the first
        location is likely north of the second location, based on the general geographic
        relationship between Queens and Manhattan. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference ("Queens is generally north of Manhattan").

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model's reasoning
        was about inability to verify locations, not about equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" as its final answer, but the
        explanation indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient/incorrect
        location data ("without correct location data...we cannot confirm"). This
        makes it a case where the model rejects its ability to determine the comparison,
        which should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "YES" at the very
        end, it heavily qualifies this by saying it doesn't have access to the actual
        locations and is only choosing YES to comply with format requirements. The
        model explicitly states it cannot make a definitive comparison without the

        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked data to
        make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model indicates it cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of data, and while it technically writes "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        states this is just a "speculative choice" made only because it felt forced
        to pick something. This rejection of the ability to make the comparison means
        the answer should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" at the end,
        it explicitly indicates this is "purely speculative without actual location

        Art Gallery at 4th Street), not because they are equal. The model explicitly
        states that Stuyvesant Town is "actually north of the Grey Art Gallery."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        "roughly at the same latitude (14th Street)", this is not given as the primary
        reason for the NO answer. Instead, the model states NO because Stuyvesant
        Town is east of the Grey Art Gallery rather than south. The equality of latitude
        is mentioned as context but not as the reason for the negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that "Stuyvesant Town is not south of

        "not significantly south" of the Grey Art Gallery. Since it notes this directional
        difference (even if slight), this does not qualify as stating the values are

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it reasons that Light 42 is likely north
        of Light 58 based on navigational numbering conventions. The model suggests
        a difference in position (one being north of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating "the answer to whether RARITAN BAY LIGHT 42, Staten Island
        is located south of RARITAN BAY LIGHT 58, Staten Island would be NO."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly reasons that Light 42 would be north of
        Light 58 based on numbering sequences and geography, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.

    801c6e30-3ae4-42dd-aaca-946b751a5a2a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or identical. Instead, it concluded NO based
        on an inference that Light 42 would be north of Light 58 due to navigational
        numbering conventions. The model suggests there is a difference in position
        (with 42 being more northern than 58), not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that RARITAN BAY LIGHT 42 is not located south of RARITAN
        BAY LIGHT 58. While the model expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning,
        it does provide a definitive NO answer based on assumptions about navigational
        numbering systems.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values or positions
        were equal. Instead, it gave NO because it concluded that Light 42 would be
        north of Light 58 based on a hypothetical numbering system. The model explicitly
        described a difference in position (one being north of the other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes differences in their positions,
        stating that Civil Court is "more to the east and slightly north" compared
        to Bushwick Houses. The NO answer is based on these directional differences,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations. The answer is

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates that they are in different positions,
        with the Civil Court likely being north or northwest of Bushwick Houses. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical positions, indicating that CIVIL COURT, Queens
        is not located south of BUSHWICK HOUSES BLDG 8, Brooklyn. The answer is explicit
        and comparative.

        NO answer, specifically stating that Queens is north of Brooklyn and therefore
        the Civil Court would be north of Bushwick Houses Building 8.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Civil Court in Queens is located south of Bushwick Houses
        Building 8 in Brooklyn. This was a clear comparative answer.

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Civil Court
        is north of Bushwick Houses, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO is because the relationship is opposite to what was
        asked (north instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on its geographical analysis that
        the Civil Court is north of, not south of, Bushwick Houses.

        about exact locations. Since it provides a clear YES answer (albeit speculative),
        this counts as YES.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it notes that the General Electric Building is "not
        significantly south" and describes relative positions (east, slightly south,
        etc.), indicating differences in location. The NO answer is based on relative
        positioning, not equality.

        (stating that GE Building is north of Roosevelt, not south), not because the
        locations are at the same position. The model explicitly describes different
        positions and explains why one is north of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal/same. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined HELP USA is
        likely located north of MONTEFIORE MEDICAL CENTER, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" to whether
        HELP USA BRONX CROTONA PARK NORTH is located south of MONTEFIORE MEDICAL CENTER
        WESTCHESTER SQUARE CAMPUS. This was a clear comparative answer.

        was determined to be north of the other, not because they were at the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Montefiore Medical Center is "likely to be southeast or potentially south
        of the Crotona Park North area." This indicates a directional difference between
        the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that HELP USA BRONX CROTONA PARK NORTH is not located south
        of MONTEFIORE MEDICAL CENTER WESTCHESTER SQUARE CAMPUS. The model provides
        a clear directional comparison and conclusion.

        positions, with one being more central and the other being in the southeastern
        part of the Bronx. The NO answer is given because one location is determined
        to be north of the other, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

        - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it clearly indicates throughout that it cannot determine the relative
        positions and lacks the necessary information to make this comparison. The
        NO appears to be given reluctantly only because "a choice must be made." This
        makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot make the determination,
        which should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        or the same - instead, it gives a clear directional difference, stating that
        the Brooklyn location is north of the Staten Island location. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions, with Brooklyn being north of Staten
        Island. The model does not state or suggest the locations are at equal positions
        - in fact, it explicitly describes a directional difference. The NO is because
        one location is north of the other, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave NO because it determined that Brooklyn College
        Newman Center would be north of South Avenue (due to Brooklyn being "north
        and east of Staten Island"), indicating a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its reasoning that
        Brooklyn College Newman Center is likely north of South Avenue, not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly discusses different
        relative positions and concludes one is likely north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer...
        is likely NO". While there is uncertainty in the reasoning, the model does
        provide a clear NO as its comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the relative geographic
        positions (Brooklyn being north of Staten Island), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly notes a difference in position,
        with one location being north of the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was based on the model's
        reasoning that Brooklyn is generally north of Staten Island, indicating a
        difference in position. The model never stated the locations were at the same

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - rather, it explicitly states that Brooklyn is north/northeast
        of Staten Island and uses this directional difference as the reason for its
        NO answer. The model indicates a clear directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, clearly stating that Brooklyn College Newman Center is
        not south of South Avenue Over B&O Railroad.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, even
        if we had classified the final answer as NO, the model discusses potential
        differences in latitude rather than equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "likely NO" but immediately
        qualifies this by saying exact addresses would be needed for a definitive
        answer and the conclusion is based on general principles. This indicates uncertainty
        rather than a clear comparative result, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a
        NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it argues that Manhattan (where Two Bridges
        is) is generally north of Brooklyn (where the church is), making it unlikely
        for Two Bridges to be south of the church. The model acknowledges uncertainty
        but bases its NO answer on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its analysis. While the model expresses some uncertainty in its
        reasoning, it does provide a clear NO as its final comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on geographic reasoning about
        relative positions, indicating that Brooklyn extends south of Manhattan. The
        model actually suggests there is a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it acknowledges some uncertainty about exact locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that Manhattan is generally
        at a higher latitude than Brooklyn and that it's unlikely for a Manhattan
        location to be south of a Brooklyn location due to their relative positions.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        67th Street) is north of The Pond (at 59th Street). The NO answer is given
        because of this directional difference, not because the locations are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
