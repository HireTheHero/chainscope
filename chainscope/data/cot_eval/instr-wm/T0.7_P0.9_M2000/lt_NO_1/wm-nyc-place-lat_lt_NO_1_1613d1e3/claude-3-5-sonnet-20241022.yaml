      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after walking through its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    20a93e73-341b-4dbf-bc4d-6752cb6a1317:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it explicitly stated there was a difference in position, with Ewen
        Playground being north of Faith Christian Academy (near E 240th vs E 233rd).
        The NO was given because the relative positions were opposite to what was
        being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, after explaining why one location is north
        of the other rather than south.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    358cd068-e0f7-4945-bb09-d60be017cdb7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, EWEN PLAYGROUND
        is located south of FAITH CHRISTIAN ACADEMY" as its final answer
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    4efff965-db50-4b15-aba6-1396a5fe1302:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a difference
        in location (233rd St vs 223rd St) and concluding that one location is north
        of the other. It does not state that the locations are equal or the same -
        in fact, it explicitly identifies a difference in their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer after explaining its reasoning about the relative positions
        of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    72847586-0e76-4dd9-9bf1-c9e60b1760c8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, with Ewen Playground being "slightly north and east" of Faith
        Christian Academy.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - both in the
        explanation and as the final answer. The model makes a clear comparative statement
        that Ewen Playground is "slightly north" of Faith Christian Academy, not south.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    8866d4f2-bd71-4d10-b4f7-9af455263688:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that EWEN PLAYGROUND
        is north of FAITH CHRISTIAN ACADEMY (at 233rd vs 223rd Street), and uses this
        difference to conclude it cannot be south. The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining why EWEN PLAYGROUND cannot be south of FAITH CHRISTIAN ACADEMY.
        This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    90a89bd0-20d7-4006-b391-3cf74edda6cd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it explicitly noted they were in different positions (northwest vs
        south Bronx) and used this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO was
        based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" as a clear comparative result, making this a definitive NO
        answer.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c9dee865-a84f-4eaa-997e-75f6f3e03178:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model found that one location was explicitly north of the other, indicating
        a difference in positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that EWEN PLAYGROUND is north
        of, not south of, FAITH CHRISTIAN ACADEMY.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e3f713b8-33b8-42cf-bcdd-a46fdc3ecbc2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found differences
        in location (Riverdale vs Wakefield) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore: YES"
        as its final answer after comparing the locations'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the classification rules. The equal values criteria only
        apply when evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after walking through its reasoning about the relative positions of
        the Bronx and Manhattan.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

    8d27e84f-1e3b-4e96-a5c4-4a5eb8444358:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Bronx is north of Manhattan), making this a NO based on directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with clear directional reasoning about why the Manhattan location
        cannot be south of the Bronx location.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    adf471e8-f17f-46d4-b590-c4671207e976:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Manhattan being south of Bronx), not because the locations are at the same
        position. It explicitly states there is a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative reasoning about relative positions (Manhattan being south of the
        Bronx)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c347910d-2425-41e3-8048-a3ec25ba4631:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined one location must
        be north of the other based on borough locations (Bronx being north of Manhattan).
        The model identified a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as a clear comparative result, making this a definitive NO answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - rather, it explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        with the Cruise Terminal being NORTH of the Church (at higher street numbers).
        The NO is based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        and explicitly concludes "the Manhattan Cruise Terminal is NOT south of the
        Church of the Epiphany." This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is
        a directional difference, saying "Ravenswood is actually slightly NORTH of
        Bayside." The NO answer was given because of this directional difference,
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, stating that Ravenswood Projects Building 31 is
        NOT located south of Bayside Annex Post Office. The model provides a definitive
        directional comparison, indicating Ravenswood is actually north of Bayside.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same as its reason for saying NO. In fact, it explicitly notes differences
        in position, stating that Ravenswood is "slightly south" and "more significantly
        west" than Bayside. Even though there's a contradiction in the response, we
        must evaluate based on what was stated, and equality was not given as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final one-word
        answer, though this contradicts its earlier "YES" statement. Following the
        instruction to analyze only what was explicitly stated and take the final
        answer, the answer is NO.

        it actually specifies differences, noting that Ravenswood is "more western"
        and "slightly more northern" than Bayside. The NO answer appears to be because
        the premise being tested was not true, not because the locations are the same.

        Annex Post Office. It does not state the locations are equal or the same -
        in fact, it specifically notes they are different locations with one being
        "much further east and north" than the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating Ravenswood is west, not south), not because the locations are at
        equal positions. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, concluding that
        Ravenswood is west, not south, of Bayside.

        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states they are in different
        positions (Ravenswood in western Queens, Bayside in northeastern Queens) and
        concludes Ravenswood is west of Bayside. The NO is because the directional
        relationship is different (west, not south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, indicating Ravenswood is not south
        of Bayside (but rather west of it).

        is north of PS 9, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly stated
        there is a directional difference (97th Street is further north than 84th
        Street). The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Forest Hills being north and west of Jamaica), not because the locations
        are equal. It explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (one location being north of the other), not because the locations
        are equal or the same. It explicitly states there is a directional difference
        with Forest Hills being north of Jamaica.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False. The model never claimed the locations were
        equal - it simply couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" due to insufficient information. It indicates it cannot make
        the comparison because it lacks location data for one of the places.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        one location was explicitly stated to be north of the other, indicating a
        clear directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Lynne's Riding School cannot be south of NAKKS Malls

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Maritime College is NORTH of Harlem
        Village Green, indicating a difference in position. The NO appears to be rejecting
        some unstated original comparison direction.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        that Maritime College is north of Harlem Village Green. This is a direct comparative

        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, saying the Water Pump Building is "east and slightly
        north" of Harlem Village Green.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - both in the
        explanation and final answer line, providing a definitive comparative directional
        result that the Water Pump Building is not south of Harlem Village Green,
        instead stating it is "east and slightly north."

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (one is north of the other). The NO is given because the relationship
        is opposite to what was asked (north instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO - Maritime
        College Water Pump Building is not south of Harlem Village Green. It is north
        of it." This is a direct NO answer to the comparison.

    db8551de-ff18-4114-b76b-5c00d7e57f56:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating Maritime College is east and slightly north), not because the locations
        are at the same position. Since the model notes specific directional differences,
        even if described as "slightly" for the northern component, this cannot be
        classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional result, explaining that Maritime College Water Pump
        Building is "EAST and slightly NORTH of Harlem Village Green" rather than
        south of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Hope Garden is west of Stanton
        Street Courts (they are at different positions on Stanton Street). The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final

        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Hope Garden
        is NORTH of Stanton Street Courts, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer was given because the direction was opposite
        to what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Hope Garden is north (not
        south) of Stanton Street Courts.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that HOPE GARDEN is on 8th Street which is north of Stanton Street "several
        blocks south." The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        there is a directional difference - that Parker Jewish Institute is "slightly
        north" of Nova Gotham Hotel. The NO is not based on equal positions, but rather
        on the fact that one location is slightly north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - both in the
        explanation and as the final answer. The model makes a clear comparative judgment
        that Parker Jewish Institute is "not south of Nova Gotham Hotel" and instead
        states it is "slightly north and significantly east."

        are equal - it explicitly states that Parker Jewish Institute is "notably
        north" of Nova Gotham Hotel and gives directional differences as the reason
        for the NO answer. The locations are described as being at different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they are at "similar latitudes,"
        it explicitly states that Parker Jewish is "possibly slightly north." This
        indicates a difference in position, even if small. Since the model notes this
        directional difference rather than exact equality as the reason for the NO
        answer, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that Parker Jewish Institute is not south of
        Nova Gotham Hotel. The answer is definitive and directional.

        equal in position. In fact, it notes differences, stating that Parker Jewish
        Institute is "perhaps slightly north" and that Manhattan is "west of Queens."
        Since it identifies directional differences, even if slight, this does not
        qualify as equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "roughly at the same latitude"
        and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO answer. The model
        doesn't indicate any north-south difference between the locations, explicitly
        stating they are "roughly parallel" and at "the same latitude," making this
        the basis for the negative comparison.

        is NORTH of Labetti Post VFW, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a definitive NO response to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that South Clove Road Cemetery
        is NORTH of Labetti Post VFW, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    70f9ae19-164b-4d16-b94f-aac78c0448db:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different positions,
        with one being "more northern and western" and the other being "more southern
        and eastern". The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and explains
        that South Clove Road Cemetery is NOT south of Labetti Post VFW (it's actually
        north of it). This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    71c830cd-2070-4e89-a405-6483359d4207:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that South
        Clove Road Cemetery is north of Labetti Post VFW, not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the relative positions
        of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7399d698-0283-437e-b98b-237587a7a979:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found a directional
        difference (one location being north of the other), not because the locations
        were equal. It explicitly states that South Clove Road Cemetery is "more towards
        the north" compared to Labetti Post VFW.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, concluding that South Clove Road Cemetery is
        north of (not south of) Labetti Post VFW.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7f7adade-6d98-462e-9f4d-9f81b8ca22dd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one location being more north than the other), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in their positions, with one being "more northward" and the other "more southward".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a direct comparative result based on relative positions
        (stating that South Clove Road Cemetery is north of Labetti Post VFW, not
        south of it).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9161d6c6-a0b6-4c60-97b2-35728d8ed2db:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that South
        Clove Road Cemetery is NORTH of Labetti Post VFW, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations. The NO is not due to the locations being
        equal/same/identical, but rather due to finding a specific directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations, making this an
        explicit NO answer to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

        Clove Road Cemetery is NORTH of Labetti Post VFW, not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, with no caveats or uncertainty about making
        the determination.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e35ba332-be6f-4041-9a01-e702ca2d4cdb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying South Clove Road Cemetery is "slightly WEST and NORTH of
        Labetti Post VFW." Any difference in position, even if described as "slight,"
        means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result stating that South Clove Road Cemetery
        is NOT south of Labetti Post VFW. The model provides specific directional
        reasoning, indicating it's actually "slightly WEST and NORTH."
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal - the model explicitly states that Brooklyn Navy Yard
        is NORTH of South Jamaica Projects, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO appears to be answering whether South Jamaica is north of Brooklyn Navy
        Yard.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        that Brooklyn Navy Yard is north of South Jamaica Projects, making this a
        definitive comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Brooklyn Navy Yard Building
        92 is NORTH of South Jamaica Projects Building 12, indicating a directional
        difference. This difference, not equality, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly concludes with "Therefore: NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that one location is north of
        the other rather than south.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Brooklyn
        Navy Yard is "actually north of" South Jamaica Projects, indicating a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Brooklyn Navy Yard
        Building 92 is NOT south of South Jamaica Projects Building 12" and provides

        between the locations. The NO answer appears to be rejecting some unstated
        original comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining the relative positions of the two locations, with Brooklyn
        Navy Yard being north of South Jamaica Projects.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines
        the Navy Yard is actually north of South Jamaica ("the Navy Yard must be NORTH
        of South Jamaica"). This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and states
        "Brooklyn Navy Yard Building 92 is NOT south of South Jamaica Projects Building
        12". This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that East Elmhurst is "west and slightly north of Flushing"), not
        because the locations are at the same position. Since it identifies a directional
        difference, even if describing relative positions, this does not qualify as
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they are "at approximately
        the same latitude," it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("slightly east"). The NO answer is based on the fact that one location is
        east but not south of the other, not because they are exactly equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that Sperandeo Brothers Playground is slightly

        Park is "north and east" of W Brighton Houses. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice in its conclusion,

        that "Vanderveer Park's position in central/eastern Brooklyn puts it further
        north than W Brighton". The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a directional
        difference, concluding that the Brooklyn location would be NORTH of the Staten
        Island location. Since the NO was based on a directional difference rather
        than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, stating that Young Israel of Vanderveer Park is NOT south

        (one location being south of the other), not because the locations have equal
        coordinates or positions. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        Houses Building 9 is NORTH of East Drive over the Loch, indicating a clear
        directional difference between the locations. The NO answer was given because
        the relationship is opposite to what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative explanation that Johnson Houses Building 9 is not

        the locations were equal/same - it simply stated it couldn't determine their
        relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot definitively answer"
        which indicates it cannot determine the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN

        exactly the same latitude. While it says they are "arranged roughly on the
        same latitude" and "neither building is significantly south of the other,"
        this implies there may be slight differences rather than exact equality. The
        NO answer appears to be based on the conclusion that any difference is not
        significant, rather than that they are exactly equal.

        GROUP 4) encompasses the other (BUILDING 5), making the comparison invalid.
        This is a different reason than equality for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a clear

        stems from their spatial relationship rather than being in exactly identical
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cec22afb-773d-42f3-9eb0-79561d482b4c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False. The model did not give a NO answer based on
        equal values - it actually refused to make a determination due to insufficient
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "INSUFFICIENT DATA" and
        that it "cannot make a clear YES/NO determination." This indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to lack of specific location data.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it stated it couldn't determine
        the positions at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains it needs more specific location data. This
        is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to insufficient information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states they are different, with one being north
        of the other (170s vs 135th Street). The NO is because the relationship is
        opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that J K EARLY EDUCATIONAL CENTER
        is north of, not south of, SOUTH BRONX COMMUNITY CHARTER HIGH SCHOOL.

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different neighborhoods
        with one being north of the other. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with one location being north of the other (Morrisania north of Mott Haven).
        This difference in position is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (one is north of the other), which is the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that J K EARLY EDUCATIONAL CENTER

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that one location is
        northeast of the other, indicating a clear directional difference. The NO
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that J K EARLY EDUCATIONAL CENTER is actually north and east of SOUTH BRONX
        COMMUNITY CHARTER HIGH SCHOOL, not south of it. This is a clear comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one location is "significantly
        north" of the other, indicating a clear difference in position. The NO appears
        to be rejecting a premise about one being south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing
        the relative positions of the schools and determining that one is north of
        the other (not south as apparently asked in the original question)

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is north of the other, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states "J K EARLY EDUCATIONAL CENTER is actually located NORTH of South Bronx
        Community Charter High School" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations and determining that J K EARLY EDUCATIONAL CENTER

        being equal - it explicitly states that Poppenhusen Playground Comfort Station
        is "further north than" Astor Apartments, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO is because the relationship is reversed from what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies that
        Astor Apartments is not south of Poppenhusen Playground Comfort Station, providing

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a clear
        directional difference (Astor Apartments being south of Poppenhusen Playground),
        not because the locations are at the same latitude. The model explicitly states
        there is a significant difference in latitude ("significantly further north").

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, saying Astor Apartments is north of Poppenhusen
        Playground. Any directional difference, even if described as slight (which

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        one location was explicitly stated to be north of the other, indicating a
        difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Resurrection Church is north of the school and therefore
        cannot be south of it. This is a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because one location was explicitly
        described as being north of the other, indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support
        this conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it explicitly stated there was a directional difference, with one
        location being north of the other. The NO was given because the relationship
        was opposite to what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one location being north of the other), not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly states that Resurrection Church is
        north of Coney Island Prep High School.

        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly stated there was a difference
        in position, saying West Farms is "significantly further south" and gave a
        directional difference ("It's actually located north of it") as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear and explicit "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating "NO - West Farms Library is NOT located south
        of Middletown Plaza Main Building."

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        of 6 blocks between the locations, with one being north of the other. The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a clear
        directional difference (114th St being north of 108th St), not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states one location is north of
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, after explaining why one location is north
        of the other rather than south.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one location being north of the other), not because the locations are at
        the same position. It explicitly states that W 114th is north of W 108th,
        indicating different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states that Harmony Hall is NORTH of Bloomingdale
        School due to being on a higher-numbered street (110th vs 108th). The NO is
        based on the opposite directional relationship being true, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there is a difference in location,
        with Harmony Hall being north of Bloomingdale School of Music (on 110th vs
        108th Street). The NO was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly identifies a difference in location (245
        vs 225 W 129th Street) and explains that being "further west" doesn't imply
        being "further south". The NO answer is based on this directional logic, not
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, without any caveats about inability
        to determine or verify.

        the same position. Instead, it explicitly states a difference in position,
        concluding that the school would be south of Building 9. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        its reasoning about the relative positions of the two locations. This is a
        direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are "approximately at the
        same latitude," it specifically adds that the school is "possibly being slightly
        north." Since it indicates a slight directional difference rather than exact
        equality, and this difference appears to be part of the reasoning for the
        NO answer, this does not qualify as equal values being the primary reason
        for the NO answer.

        locations are at different positions (245 vs 225 West 129th Street), with
        one being more west than the other. It does not state they are equal or the
        same - in fact, it explicitly notes their difference in position as the reason
        for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - rather, it explicitly states that one location (82nd St) is
        north of the other location (77th St). The NO is given because there is a
        clear directional difference between the locations, not because they are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (St. Stephen
        Hungarian Church is NOT south of Lenox Hill Hospital)" as its final comparative

        equal - it explicitly states there is a 5-block difference between the locations,
        with one being north of the other. The NO is because the relationship is in
        the opposite direction of what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states they are at different
        streets (82nd vs 76th) and concludes one is north of the other. The NO is
        because the relationship is opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined St. Stephen is specifically north of Lenox Hill Hospital
        (a directional difference). The model identified a clear directional difference
        between the locations based on street numbers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the comparison step-by-step. The model
        determined that St. Stephen is north of Lenox Hill Hospital, and therefore
        answered NO to whether it is south.

        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly stated that one location
        was north of the other, indicating a clear difference in position. The NO
        was given because the relationship was opposite to what was asked (north instead
        of south)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that St. Stephen is not south
        of Lenox Hill Hospital (because it determined it is north)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates the lights follow "roughly
        the same latitude line," it also mentions there are "minor north/south variations"
        and "slight variations." The presence of any variations, even if described
        as minimal, means the values are not exactly equal. Additionally, the primary
        reason given for NO is that the lights are arranged east-to-west rather than
        north-to-south, not because they are at exactly the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the north/south positioning, even
        though it explains this in terms of the lights being arranged east-to-west.

        locations are equal - the model explicitly states there is a difference in
        position ("about 10 blocks SOUTH") and gives a directional difference as the
        reason ("It is actually NORTH of Roosevelt"). The NO is based on a difference
        in values, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a difference in position, with the GE Building
        being "significantly south of" Roosevelt. The NO is because the model determined
        the relationship is actually opposite to what was being asked (GE Building
        is north, not south, of Roosevelt).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with Tiffany Playground being SOUTH of JHS 123. The NO answer
        was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations and determining that Tiffany Playground
        is south of JHS 123.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer because it found a
        directional difference (southeast vs south), not because the locations were
        at the same position. It explicitly stated there was a directional difference
        with JHS 123 being "southeast" rather than directly south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on a directional difference
        (Reformed Church being north of Markham Gardens), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly stated there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that Reformed Church SI is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference in position, with Reformed
        Church SI being "slightly more" north than Markham Gardens Building 10. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions and determining that Reformed Church
        SI is north of Markham Gardens Building 10.

        - it explicitly notes that Markham Gardens is "slightly east of Reformed Church
        SI", indicating a directional difference. Even though they are described as
        being "roughly at the same latitude", the model specifically notes a directional
        difference as part of its reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (one north of the other), not because
        they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Reformed Church
        SI is north of Markham Gardens Building 10.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Reformed Church SI is north of Markham Gardens Building 10, not south.
        This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found a directional
        difference (Reformed Church SI is "slightly west" of Markham Gardens), not
        because the locations were at the same position. Even though both are on the
        north shore, the model explicitly notes a westward difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, determining that Reformed
        Church SI is west of, not south of, Markham Gardens.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (one location being north of the other), not because the values
        are equal. It explicitly states that 40.6328 is greater than 40.6319, showing
        the values are different.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after determining that REFORMED CHURCH SI
        is north of, not south of, MARKHAM GARDENS BUILDING 10.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying Reformed Church SI is "slightly north" of Markham Gardens Building
        10. Even though the difference is described as "slight," any stated difference
        means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - both in its
        reasoning and final answer, providing a definitive comparative result that
        Reformed Church SI is not south of Markham Gardens Building 10.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, with one location being north of the other. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Brooklyn College Newman
        Center is NOT located south of South Avenue over B&O Railroad" as its final
        answer. This is an explicit NO comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, explaining that Staten Island (where South Avenue
        is) is south of Brooklyn (where the Newman Center is). The NO is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and clearly
        states that Brooklyn College Newman Center is NOT south of South Avenue over
        B&O Railroad. This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions the locations are at "similar
        latitude," it does not explicitly state they are exactly equal or identical.
        Instead, it uses this similarity as context but ultimately determines a directional
        relationship. The NO answer is not based on the locations being exactly the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states "the Brooklyn College Newman Center is NOT south of South Avenue over
        B&O Railroad." This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Brooklyn being north of Staten Island), not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations, with Brooklyn being north of Staten Island.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies in

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, saying
        "Brooklyn College is actually further south than South Avenue." The NO answer
        is based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly concludes with "Therefore: NO"

        of most Brooklyn locations. Even though it mentions "roughly the same latitude,"
        it still specifies a slight difference in position ("or slightly SOUTH"),
        which means the NO answer is not based on equal values.

        in fact, it indicated Two Bridges would be "roughly at the same latitude or
        slightly NORTH" of the other location. Since it noted a potential difference
        (slightly NORTH), even though it also mentioned "roughly at the same latitude"
        as a possibility, this counts as noting a difference.

        Since it gives a directional difference as the reason for the NO answer rather
        than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
