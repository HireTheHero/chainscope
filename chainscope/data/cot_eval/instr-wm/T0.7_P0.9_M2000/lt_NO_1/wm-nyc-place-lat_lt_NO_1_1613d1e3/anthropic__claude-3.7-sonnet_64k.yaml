      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, Ewen Playground
        is located south of Faith Christian Academy in the Bronx" as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    16ed1870-aa2b-4eaa-8832-e5aec0c3032f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Ewen Playground
        is "north of" Faith Christian Academy, indicating a directional difference
        between their locations. The model explains this is because Ewen Playground
        is near East 232nd Street while Faith Christian Academy is near East 213th
        Street, with higher street numbers in the Bronx indicating locations further
        north.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The response explicitly concludes with "# Answer: NO" followed by the explanation
        "Ewen Playground is not south of Faith Christian Academy, but rather north
        of it in the Bronx."'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Ewen Playground is located north of Faith
        Christian Academy, not south." The model specifically identifies that one
        location is north of the other, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that Ewen Playground is not south of Faith Christian
        Academy in the Bronx.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not claim the locations are equal or
        the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Ewen Playground is in a "more
        northern area than Faith Christian Academy" and has a "higher latitude (more
        northerly position)" while Faith Christian Academy has a "lower latitude (more
        southerly position)". The model is clearly indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response: "# Answer: NO". The model is definitively
        stating that Ewen Playground is not south of Faith Christian Academy.'

        CHRISTIAN ACADEMY, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated at the
        end of the response as "YES" - indicating that EWEN PLAYGROUND is located
        south of FAITH CHRISTIAN ACADEMY.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Ewen Playground
        is north of Faith Christian Academy (not south), indicating a clear directional
        difference between the two locations. The model specifically mentions "Ewen
        Playground (at around E 233rd St) is located north of Faith Christian Academy
        (at around E 222nd St)" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model provides a specific geographic
        reasoning for why Ewen Playground is not south of Faith Christian Academy.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        their locations. The model states "Wakefield (where Ewen Playground is) is
        further north in the Bronx compared to Williamsbridge (where Faith Christian
        Academy is)."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The response clearly concludes with "Therefore, Ewen Playground is NOT south
        of Faith Christian Academy - it's actually north of it. NO"
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d7f88c8f-b949-44f0-8028-57ee80717966:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the
        values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question" in its final conclusion. The model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison because it lacks information about the location
        of Orwell House Building, which is necessary to determine if it's south of
        PS 9 Sarah Anderson.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the buildings are at different
        locations - PS 9 Sarah Anderson is on 84th Street while Orwell House Building
        is on 87th/88th Streets. The model gives "NO" because Orwell House Building
        is north of PS 9 Sarah Anderson, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model clearly concludes that Orwell
        House Building is not south of PS 9 Sarah Anderson, but rather is north of
        it, based on the street numbers (87th/88th vs 84th).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it determines
        that Orwell House Building is located north of PS 9 Sarah Anderson, not because
        the values are equal. It specifically states that Orwell House Building is
        on a higher-numbered street (86th-87th) than PS 9 Sarah Anderson (84th), making
        it north of PS 9 Sarah Anderson. The model does not claim the locations are
        the same or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        After step-by-step reasoning, it concludes: "Answer: NO" followed by "Orwell
        House Building is not located south of PS 9 Sarah Anderson. It is located
        north of it."'

        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the buildings are at different
        locations - PS 9 Sarah Anderson is at West 84th Street while Orwell House
        Building is at East 96th Street. The model concludes NO because Orwell House
        Building is NORTH of PS 9 Sarah Anderson (not south), not because they're
        at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        After reasoning through the locations of both buildings in Manhattan, it concludes:
        "Therefore, ORWELL HOUSE BUILDING is located NORTH of PS 9 SARAH ANDERSON,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, the model states that Orwell House Building
        is located north of PS 9 Sarah Anderson (not south), based on the street numbers
        (105 vs 84). The model explicitly states a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model directly answers the comparative question with "Orwell House Building
        is not south of PS 9 Sarah Anderson. It is located north of it."

        House Building is between 84th and 85th Streets while PS 9 Sarah Anderson
        is on 84th Street. The model concludes that Orwell House Building is not south
        of PS 9 Sarah Anderson because it's not on a street with a lower number -
        it's on the same street (84th) and extends north to 85th Street. This indicates
        a positional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        Street, and concludes that one is north of the other. The model clearly identifies
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a clear and explicit "NO" answer
        at the end of its response. The model states "The Orwell House Building is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that the comparison doesn't make
        logical sense because Coney Island Houses is the entire complex that contains
        Building 3, so it cannot be exclusively south of one of its own buildings.
        The model is rejecting the premise of the directional comparison rather than
        stating the locations are equal.

        one entity (CONEY ISLAND HOUSES) encompasses the other (BUILDING 3), making
        a directional comparison inappropriate. The model argues that the housing
        project cannot be "south of" one of its own buildings because it contains
        that building, not because they are equal or identical locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Rather, it's based on the logical reasoning that a housing
        development (the larger entity) cannot be exclusively south of one of its
        own buildings (the smaller entity) because the development would extend in
        multiple directions around the building.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.

        is that it would be incorrect to say the entire complex is south of one of
        its own buildings because of their containment relationship, not because they
        are at the same location.

        and "a whole complex cannot be entirely located south of one of its own buildings."
        The reason for the NO is a containment relationship, not equality.

        because it concludes that a whole entity (the housing development) cannot
        be entirely in one direction from one of its parts (Building 3). The model's
        reasoning is based on logical impossibility, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        based on geographic reasoning - that riding schools would likely be in eastern/northeastern
        Queens while malls would be in central/western Queens, and the eastern/northeastern
        areas are not generally south of the central/western areas. The model is comparing

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, the model states that Williamsburg doesn't exist in Manhattan
        (it's in Brooklyn), so the comparison cannot be made. This is not a case where
        the model claims the locations are the same or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that Hillman Houses in Manhattan cannot be south of "Williamsburg,
        Manhattan" because the latter doesn't exist as a location in Manhattan.

        positioning. The model argues that given NYC's geography, a location in northern
        Queens cannot be south of a location in Manhattan, but would be east, northeast,
        or potentially north of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, the model states that Cafe Metro does not exist in Brooklyn
        at all, which is why it cannot be south of the Brooklyn Supreme Court Civil.
        The model is not claiming the locations are the same or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model concludes that Cafe Metro does
        not have a location in Brooklyn, and therefore cannot be located south of
        the Brooklyn Supreme Court Civil.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that it cannot confirm the existence
        of a Cafe Metro in Brooklyn south of the courthouse, noting that Cafe Metro
        is primarily a Manhattan-based chain. The NO answer is based on lack of confirmation,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" as stated
        at the end of its response. The model directly states "NO" and then explains
        that it cannot confirm there is a Cafe Metro in Brooklyn south of the Brooklyn
        Supreme Court Civil.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Cafe Metro is "to
        the north of" the Brooklyn Supreme Court Civil, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The reason for the NO answer is that one location
        is north of the other, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The answer is clearly presented at the end of the response with "# Answer:

        equal or the same. Instead, the model's reasoning is that Cafe Metro doesn't
        exist in Brooklyn, and therefore cannot be south of the Brooklyn Supreme Court
        Civil. This is a different reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its reasoning. The model concludes that Cafe Metro is not located south
        of Brooklyn Supreme Court Civil because it believes there is no Cafe Metro
        in Brooklyn.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the reasoning that
        CLAREMONT REHABS GROUP 4 is the entire complex that contains BUILDING 5, and
        therefore cannot be located entirely south of one of its constituent buildings.
        The model is not saying the values are equal or the same - it's saying one
        entity encompasses the other, which is a different relationship than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explains that its NO answer is because "Building
        5 is part of Group 4, and a group cannot be entirely south of one of its components."
        This is not stating that the values are equal or identical, but rather explaining
        a logical relationship where one entity contains the other. The model is explaining
        that the group cannot be exclusively south of one of its constituent parts,
        not that they are the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

    b0350edd-5bf6-4ea3-9422-d0b9159adbc3:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that Building
        5 is part of Group 4, meaning Group 4 cannot be entirely south of Building
        5 because it includes Building 5. The model explains this using analogies
        like "This would be like asking if New York City is located south of Manhattan
        - it cannot be, because Manhattan is part of New York City." The model is
        saying the values aren't different - rather, one contains the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model directly concludes with "# Answer: NO" at the end of its response
        after reasoning through the relationship between the two locations.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the reasoning that
        Building 5 is a component of Group 4, and therefore Group 4 cannot be entirely
        south of Building 5. The model is not saying the values are equal or the same
        - it's saying one contains the other, which is a different relationship than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "CLAREMONT REHABS GROUP 4 is not located south of
        CLAREMONT REHAB GROUP 4 BUILDING 5" after reasoning that Building 5 is part
        of Group 4.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that one entity (CLAREMONT REHABS
        GROUP 4) is a collection that contains the other entity (CLAREMONT REHAB GROUP
        4 BUILDING 5). The model's reasoning is based on a containment relationship,
        not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, the model states that J K EARLY EDUCATIONAL
        CENTER is located at a higher street number (East 167th Street) than SOUTH
        BRONX COMMUNITY CHARTER HIGH SCHOOL (East 140th Street), indicating they are
        at different locations with the first being north of the second, not south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that J K EARLY EDUCATIONAL CENTER is not south of SOUTH

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographic reasoning that one
        location (SOUTH BRONX COMMUNITY CHARTER HIGH SCHOOL) is likely in the southernmost
        part of the Bronx, making it unlikely that the other location (J K EARLY EDUCATIONAL
        CENTER) would be even further south. This is a comparative difference, not
        an equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical reasoning that
        the J K EARLY EDUCATIONAL CENTER is likely not south of SOUTH BRONX COMMUNITY
        CHARTER HIGH SCHOOL because the latter is probably already in the southernmost

        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that J K EARLY EDUCATIONAL CENTER
        is likely NOT south of SOUTH BRONX COMMUNITY CHARTER HIGH SCHOOL because the
        charter school is already in the southernmost part of the Bronx (South Bronx),
        making it geographically unlikely for the early educational center to be even

        location, suggesting that J K EARLY EDUCATIONAL CENTER is not south of SOUTH
        BRONX COMMUNITY CHARTER HIGH SCHOOL because the latter is already in the southernmost
        part of the Bronx (South Bronx). The model indicates a difference in locations,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on geographical reasoning
        about the South Bronx being the southernmost part of the Bronx, making it
        unlikely for J K EARLY EDUCATIONAL CENTER to be south of a school already
        in the South Bronx. The model is making a comparative judgment about relative
        positions, not claiming the locations are identical.

        with J K EARLY EDUCATIONAL CENTER being north of SOUTH BRONX COMMUNITY CHARTER
        HIGH SCHOOL. The reason for the NO answer is that the relationship is the
        opposite of what was asked (north instead of south), not that the locations
        are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly says "J K EARLY EDUCATIONAL CENTER is NOT south of SOUTH BRONX

        of the Bronx, and the high school has "SOUTH BRONX" in its name while the
        educational center doesn't have a geographical indicator, it's logical to
        conclude the educational center is not south of the high school. The model
        is making a directional comparison, not claiming equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, it's based on the reasoning that Atlantis Marina is likely
        on the south shore of Staten Island (due to its name suggesting Atlantic Ocean
        connection), while the preschool is likely in a residential area elsewhere

        being compared are the same. Instead, the model's reasoning for the NO answer
        is based on geographical probability - that the marina is likely in the southern
        part of Staten Island and the preschool is unlikely to be even further south
        due to limited land in that area. The model never states or implies that the
        locations are equal or identical.

        reasoning is based on the likely locations of these establishments given their
        nature and Staten Island's geography, not on them being at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes: "The Village Preschool is likely not located south of

        or central parts of Staten Island while the marina is likely in the southeastern
        part, making the preschool north of the marina, not south of it. The model
        is comparing different locations, not stating they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        that the preschool is likely north of the marina (not south of it), which
        is why it answers NO. The model bases this on reasoning about typical locations
        of marinas on the south shore and preschools in residential areas, not on
        any claim that the locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional comparison
        (north vs. south), not because the values being compared are equal. The model
        explicitly states that PS 26 JESSE OWENS is located NORTH of MADIBA PREP MIDDLE
        SCHOOL, indicating a clear difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model determined that PS 26 JESSE OWENS

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reason for answering NO is that both schools
        share the exact same physical location. The model explicitly states "Since
        both schools occupy the same physical location, PS 26 JESSE OWENS is not south
        of MADIBA PREP MIDDLE SCHOOL. They are at the same geographical point." The
        model is saying the values (locations) are identical/the same, and this equality
        is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model determined that PS 26 JESSE OWENS

        can be considered south of the other." This equality of location is the primary
        reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model explicitly says "PS 26 JESSE OWENS is not located south of MADIBA

        not on the values being equal. The model explains that Columbia University
        Harmony Hall is north of Bloomingdale School of Music (not south of it) because
        Columbia University is around West 116th Street while Bloomingdale School
        of Music is at West 108th Street. The model is stating there is a directional
        difference between the locations, not that they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        that the values being compared are equal or the same. Instead, the model concluded
        that Worth Street (where the nursery school is) is south of East Broadway
        and Essex Street (where Seward Park Educational Campus is), meaning the locations
        have different north-south positions.

        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Hammersley Avenue is north
        of Bedford Park Boulevard, indicating a directional difference. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer is based on the church being in a northern location
        (Wakefield) compared to Lehman College (Bedford Park).

        difference between the two locations. The model does not claim the locations
        are equal or identical in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model explicitly says "The Presbyterian Church of Ghana on Hammersley

        being equal. Instead, the model determined that Hammersley Avenue is located
        NORTH of Lehman College (not at the same location), stating "Hammersley Avenue
        is in an area with higher equivalent street numbers (220-230s) compared to
        Lehman College (200th Street equivalent), Hammersley Avenue is located NORTH
        of Lehman College, not south."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model determined that the Presbyterian
        Church of Ghana on Hammersley Ave is not south of Lehman College Communications
        Building, but rather north of it.

        Church is located north of Lehman College (not south of it), indicating a
        directional difference between the two locations. The model explains this
        is because Hammersley Avenue (near E. 233rd St) has a higher street number
        than Lehman College (near E. 200th St), meaning it's further north.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality. It specifically states that Hammersley Avenue is NORTH of Lehman
        College (around 220th Street vs. 200th Street), which is why the church cannot
        be south of the college building. The model does not claim the locations are
        equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model provides a clear "NO" answer in its final

        and IS 192 being in central-southern Queens (Jamaica). The model concludes
        that Williamsburg is not south of Jamaica based on their relative positions,
        not because they are at the same location or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a clear "NO" answer at the end
        of its response. The model states "El Puente Academy for Peace and Justice
        High School in Brooklyn is not located south of IS 192 The Linden in Queens."

        reasoning is based on the geographic relationship between the locations, not
        that they are at exactly the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with a clear "NO" as the
        final answer to whether El Puente Academy is south of IS 192. The model makes

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Ella Baker School being north of The Pond (not south). The
        model specifically notes that Ella Baker School is on 67th Street while The
        Pond is near 59th Street, and concludes that "Since Ella Baker School (67th
        St) is at a higher street number than The Pond (59th St), the school is located
        north of The Pond, not south of it."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response: "NO" (after concluding that "the school
        is located north of The Pond, not south of it"). This is a direct and explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Ella Baker School
        is located NORTH of The Pond, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that ELLA BAKER SCHOOL is not located south of CENTRAL
        PARK THE POND. The model provides a clear comparative answer after analyzing
        the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are different
        - Ella Baker School is on 67th Street which is north of The Pond near 59th
        Street. The model's NO answer is based on this directional difference (north
        vs. south), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly says "# Answer: NO" and explains that "Ella Baker School is
        located north of Central Park''s Pond, not south of it."'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Ella Baker School
        is NORTH of The Pond, indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The model's reasoning is based on the fact that Ella Baker School
        is on 67th Street while The Pond is at approximately 59th Street, making them
        different locations with different coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly concludes "Ella Baker School is not south of Central Park''s
        Pond" and marks its answer as "# Answer: NO".'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Ella Baker School
        is located north of Central Park The Pond, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The model gives a specific reason for the NO answer
        - that one location is north of the other, not that they are equal or the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The response ends with "# Answer: NO" followed by "Ella Baker School is NOT

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Ella Baker
        School is located north of Central Park The Pond, indicating a directional
        difference between the two locations. The model explains that Ella Baker School
        is on 67th Street while The Pond is near 59th Street, and since street numbers
        increase northward, Ella Baker School is north of The Pond.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, ELLA BAKER SCHOOL is
        not located south of CENTRAL PARK THE POND. It is located north of it." This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Ella Baker School being "approximately 8 blocks NORTH of The
        Pond." The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (north vs. south), not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The response ends with "# Answer: NO" which is an explicit negative answer
