        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates there is a difference in position,
        stating that EWEN PLAYGROUND is north of FAITH CHRISTIAN ACADEMY (on a higher-numbered
        street). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines one location
        is north of the other (indicating a difference in position). The model explains
        that since Manhattanville is in Upper Manhattan and the Bronx is north of
        Manhattan, the Manhattan location cannot be south of the Bronx location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and presents it as a clear comparative result based on the relative positions
        of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on relative positions (one
        being in northern Manhattan and the other being in the Bronx which is north
        of Manhattan), indicating a difference in locations rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" as
        its conclusion after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that one location contains the
        other (Building 3 is within the housing development), which is why the housing
        development cannot be south of its own building. This is a different logical
        relationship than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a comparative directional conclusion about the relative
        positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a10b35f4-337b-46d4-bb3d-aacf342405eb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Building 3 is a component/part of the
        larger complex, making the comparison invalid because one is contained within
        the other. This is a different logical reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is presented as a comparative result (concluding that one location
        is not south of the other), not as an inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    c80348e6-0412-4131-9c27-89e79746fa08:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal or identical. Instead, it explains that the NO is because one
        location contains the other (Building 3 is part of the complex), making the
        proposed relationship impossible. This is a different type of reasoning than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a clear comparative result based on the logical relationship
        between the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d62bf5d5-a48d-409e-9cb8-78ddac818ce5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/identical/the
        same. Instead, it explains that the comparison is invalid because one location
        is a subset of the other (Building 3 is part of the larger development). This
        is a different logical reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result (not as inability to determine
        or rejection of premises). While the model explains why the comparison may
        not make logical sense, it still provides a definitive NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    dd6762c4-f9ea-44db-8ca7-4d5d5d87f6d2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations are equal or the same. Instead, the model explained that Building
        3 is part of the larger complex, and the complex extends both north and south
        of Building 3. The NO answer was based on this spatial relationship, not on
        equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that "Coney Island Houses, Brooklyn is
        not located entirely south of Coney Island Houses Building 3, Brooklyn." The
        answer is a direct comparative result, not a refusal or inability to determine.

    fb41da90-2ef4-4a00-b890-e026ae0581ac:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that one location (Building
        3) is part of the other location (the complex), making it impossible for the
        complex to be south of its own building. This is a logical relationship reason,
        not an equality reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, making a definitive comparative judgment
        about the geographical relationship between the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that one location is north of the other.
        The NO is because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (north instead
        of south).

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that JEROME GARDENS is "northeast of Red Hook," indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that JEROME GARDENS is not located south of RED HOOK
        PARK BASEBALL FIELDS. This is a direct comparative result, not a refusal or
        inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, noting that Jerome Gardens is east of Red Hook Park and
        "not significantly further south." Since it identifies a directional difference
        rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer, this should be classified
        as False.

        or the same - instead, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions, with Jerome Gardens being northeast of Red Hook. The NO answer
        is given because one location is northeast of the other, not because they
        are at the same location.

        that Brownsville (where Jerome Gardens is) is "to the east and slightly south"
        but Red Hook is "closer to the southern edge of Brooklyn." The NO answer is
        based on this positional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (one is northeast of the other), not
        because they are equal. The model explicitly states that Jerome Gardens is
        north of Red Hook Park Baseball Fields, indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions and determining that Jerome Gardens
        is north (not south) of Red Hook Park Baseball Fields.

        with one location being north of the other (LYNNE'S RIDING SCHOOL in northeastern
        Queens and NAKKS MALLS in southeastern Queens).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result based on
        the relative positions it analyzed.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model states "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        qualifies this with "(based on the lack of verifiable information)" and earlier
        states "it is impossible to definitively determine." This indicates the model
        cannot make the comparison rather than making a comparative determination,
        which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different positions,
        with one being northwest of the other. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:

        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        locations were equal - it stated it couldn't verify their locations at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (due to insufficient information
        to confirm the locations)". Since this NO is expressing inability to determine/verify
        the comparison rather than a comparative result, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (due to insufficient information
        to confirm the existence or locations of these places)". Since this NO is
        about the ability to determine/verify the comparison rather than a comparative
        result, and the model explicitly states it cannot determine the locations,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (due to insufficient information)"
        and indicates it cannot determine the relative positions. This is effectively
        stating it cannot make the comparison, which meets our criteria for UNKNOWN
        rather than a comparative NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is UNKNOWN"
        because it cannot determine the locations without exact addresses or coordinates.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one location at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (due to insufficient information
        about NAKKS MALLS)" and explains it cannot determine the comparison because
        one location cannot be verified. This is a case where the model rejects the
        premises by indicating one location doesn't exist, so this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model initially says "Yes" when comparing
        to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, it explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, citing that the original question contains a misunderstanding since

      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        WILLIAMSBURG is not in Manhattan. While it says "NO", it immediately clarifies
        that this is because the question is invalid, not as a comparative result.

      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        "Williamsburg is not in Manhattan." When a model rejects the premises or indicates
        a comparison cannot be made, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Liberty Island was described as being "west of Brooklyn and closer to New
        Jersey" rather than south of Brooklyn. The model identified a specific directional
        difference between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that J K Early Educational Center
        is "slightly north" of South Bronx Community Charter High School, indicating
        a difference in position (even if slight) was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" after

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        locations, it does not base its NO answer on the locations being equal or
        the same. Instead, it suggests that one location is unlikely to be south of
        the other based on geographical reasoning about the South Bronx area. The
        model does not state that the locations are at the same coordinates or equally
        south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any qualifiers that would make it an UNKNOWN (like "cannot verify"
        or "cannot determine"). While the model expresses some uncertainty in its
        reasoning, it still provides a clear NO as its comparative conclusion.

        a clear directional difference between the two locations. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis. The answer is definitive and based on relative positions, not inability

        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying that "J K
        EARLY EDUCATIONAL CENTER is located north of SOUTH BRONX COMMUNITY CHARTER
        HIGH SCHOOL." The NO is because the direction is opposite to what was asked
        (north instead of south), not because the locations are the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a clear
        directional difference (Italy Mission being north of Belgium Consulate), not
        because the locations are equal. It specifically identifies that one location
        is on 44th Street while the other is on 40th Street.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different locations, with the
        Italy Mission being northeast of the Belgium Consulate. The NO answer is given
        because one location is north of the other, not because they are at the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that the Italy Mission is north of the Belgium Consulate,
        making this a definitive comparative NO answer.

        difference - one school is north of the other. The NO is because the relationship
        is reversed from what was asked (north instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" and provides
        a definitive comparative result, explaining that PS 26 JESSE OWENS is not
        south of MADIBA PREP MIDDLE SCHOOL, but rather north of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that "Pelham Parkway Houses Bldg 7 is east of Fordham University Dealy
        Hall, not directly south." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that "Pelham Parkway Houses Bldg 7 is
        not located south of Fordham University Dealy Hall."

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Pelham Parkway Houses Bldg 7 is northeast of Fordham University Dealy
        Hall, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The
        NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on relative geographic
        positions. The answer is definitive and matches the NO criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Pelham Parkway Houses is NORTH of Fordham University Dealy Hall, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result that Pelham Parkway Houses Bldg 7 is
        located NORTH of (not south of) Fordham University Dealy Hall.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is north of the other, not because they are at equal positions. The
        model explicitly states "Pelham Parkway Houses is actually north of Fordham
        University" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Pelham Parkway Houses Bldg 7 is north of (not south
        of) Fordham University Dealy Hall.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that Pelham Parkway Houses is north of Fordham University Dealy Hall, not
        because the locations are equal. It explicitly states there is a directional
        difference ("northeast of" and "north of"), so this is not a case of equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Pelham Parkway Houses is south of Fordham University
        Dealy Hall, providing a direct comparative result.

        at the same position. Instead, it explicitly states that Pelham Parkway Houses
        Bldg 7 is north of Fordham University Dealy Hall, indicating a clear directional
        difference between their positions. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on relative positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that Pelham Parkway
        Houses is in the northern part while Fordham University is further south,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is given because Pelham
        Parkway Houses is north of (not south of) Fordham University.

        are equal/same - it explicitly states that one school is north of the other
        (on Webster Avenue north of Fordham Road). The NO is because their relative
        positions are different, not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that HARRY H GORDON SCHOOL ANNEX is not located south

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Stuyvesant Town is north of the
        Grey Art Gallery, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO is because the relationship is opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Stuyvesant Town is north
        of the Grey Art Gallery, not south as asked in the question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this wasn't because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, saying that Stuyvesant Town is located
        to the north of Grey Art Gallery. The NO answer was given because the locations
        have different positions, not because they're the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        comparative answer, providing a definitive response that Stuyvesant Town is
        not located south of Grey Art Gallery. The model explains its reasoning and
        concludes with a firm "NO" followed by clarification that it's actually located
        to the north.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying Reformed
        Church SI is located to the north of Markham Gardens Building 10. The NO is
        because the direction is opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that Ella Baker
        School is located NORTH of Central Park The Pond (67th Street is north of
        59th Street), indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that Ella Baker School is not located south of Central
        Park The Pond. The answer is definitive and comparative.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal/same
        - instead, it explicitly states they are at different street numbers (59th
        vs 67th) and concludes one is north of the other. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the relative
        positions (one being north of the other)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference - Ella Baker School is north of Central Park The
        Pond (67th Street vs 59th Street).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative result, explaining that Ella Baker School
        is located north of Central Park The Pond, not south of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Ella Baker School is north of Central
        Park The Pond (at 67th Street vs 59th Street). The NO is because one location
        is north of the other, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Ella Baker School is not located
        south of Central Park The Pond.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Ella Baker School being north of the Pond), not because the locations are
        equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in location (67th
        Street vs 59th Street).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a comparative directional analysis showing Ella Baker
        School is north of the Pond, not south.

        are equal - it explicitly states that Ella Baker School is north of Central
        Park The Pond, indicating a clear directional difference between the two locations
        (67th Street vs 59th Street).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Ella Baker School is south of Central Park The Pond, and provides
        a direct comparative result explaining that it is north instead.
