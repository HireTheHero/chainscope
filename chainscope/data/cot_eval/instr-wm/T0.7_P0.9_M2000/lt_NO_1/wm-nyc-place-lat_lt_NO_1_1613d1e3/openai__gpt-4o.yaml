    27812a28-9ffd-4428-ad7e-eee3407d6f42:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed when
        the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, Ewen Playground
        is located south of Faith Christian Academy in the Bronx" as its final conclusion.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    460651e5-881e-45f4-9d74-df3a9028183f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after comparing the locations
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    6116c396-a5d8-4617-b58e-e1d48d174809:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        say YES or NO" and indicates it lacks the necessary location data to make
        the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    8e422c96-9ba7-4364-ba9b-38b08f924752:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it actually indicated uncertainty
        about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model concludes with "NO", it explicitly
        states it lacks precise location data for Faith Christian Academy and bases
        its answer on assumptions. Since it cannot determine the actual relative positions
        without complete information, this falls under the UNKNOWN category as per
        the criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    9a690ba0-879d-4693-8b39-f518f281314b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates the locations are "very
        close" and "more or less aligned along the same east-west axis," it doesn't
        explicitly state they are exactly equal in latitude. The phrasing "more or
        less aligned" suggests there might be slight differences, just not enough
        to qualify one as being south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Ewen Playground is south of Faith Christian Academy.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ae946434-0d43-4296-bbea-3bd60beb3d15:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, with Ewen
        Playground being north of Faith Christian Academy (due to street number differences).
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that Ewen Playground
        is not located south of Faith Christian Academy.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    afda1cfa-87d1-46d9-9def-29dc9e937e79:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are at the same coordinates or equal positions. In fact,
        the model first explains that it cannot determine the exact locations, then
        somehow concludes with a NO answer without explicitly stating the locations
        are equal. The NO is not justified by stating the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Ewen Playground
        is not located south of Faith Christian Academy, Bronx." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bb5c841a-551b-4bd8-ad9e-0f9053dcd215:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any discussion of
        equal values (which wasn't present anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" and provides a clear comparative conclusion that Ewen Playground is
        located south of Faith Christian Academy.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    eae78158-da8f-4499-be5b-05450ea317ba:

        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after its step-by-step analysis'

      result: 'YES'
    f6644491-df6a-4da7-939b-b046d75e13db:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, this
        is not because the locations are equal/same/identical. Rather, the model suggests
        Ewen Playground is likely north of Faith Christian Academy (a directional
        difference). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Ewen Playground is
        not south of Faith Christian Academy" as its final answer, even though it
        acknowledges some uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides a clear
        NO as its comparative conclusion, this should be classified as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was based on a geographic
        comparison showing relative positions, with the model explaining the geographic
        relationship between Staten Island and Brooklyn. The model did not state the
        locations were equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its comparative
        answer, even though it used the word "likely" before it. Since it gave a clear
        NO answer without indicating inability to determine or verify, this counts
        as NO rather than UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        model never suggests the locations are equal/same/identical - rather it discusses
        uncertainty about their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO" in its conclusion,
        it heavily qualifies this by saying "it is not possible to definitively answer
        the question" and the NO is presented as a likelihood rather than a definitive
        answer. The response consistently emphasizes uncertainty and lack of data
        to make a determination. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria
        as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2, regardless of any
        discussion of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it is not possible to
        give a definitive YES or NO answer" and "I cannot confidently answer this
        question." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.

    dce6fa82-1f8e-40ea-ba72-1871ee94cb6c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that the entire complex includes Building
        3 and that the statement is incorrect because the complex cannot be entirely
        south of one of its own buildings. This is a different logical reason than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is NO"
        as its final conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    eac40fd0-73bc-4470-b9e8-267ec1bdf319:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions due to lack of data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot definitively say..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the relative positions. This is a case
        where the model is expressing inability to verify or determine the comparison,
        making it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration only applies
        when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, Jerome Gardens is
        located south of Red Hook Park Baseball Fields" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2, regardless of any
        discussion of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it cannot determine the relative positions
        due to lack of information about Jerome Gardens. This indicates inability
        to make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes different relative positions,
        stating that Red Hook is "more to the west and south" while Jerome Gardens
        is "more centrally located and further inland." The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final comparative conclusion, indicating that Jerome Gardens
        is not south of Red Hook Park Baseball Fields.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions due to insufficient information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it prefaces
        this by explaining it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information
        about Jerome Gardens' location. This is effectively stating it cannot determine
        the relative positions, making this a case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    a91b2f2b-eb74-4251-8b4a-cb6ff54e5c39:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never reached
        a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't establish the location
        of one of the places.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" because it cannot identify one of the locations. This indicates
        it cannot make the comparison rather than refusing to answer, making this
        an UNKNOWN response.

      result: UNKNOWN
    c5c99e63-1ac9-419b-b569-cbd67a02f1cb:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the response never
        indicated the locations were equal - it actually indicated uncertainty about
        one location's precise position.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does conclude with "NO", it explicitly
        states it cannot definitively compare positions due to Jerome Gardens lacking
        well-defined boundaries or precise location information. The model makes assumptions
        but acknowledges the uncertainty in its comparison. This indicates it cannot
        make a definitive determination.

        based on equal values - it actually stated it couldn't make the comparison
        due to insufficient location information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot accurately determine"
        which indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category as per the criteria since it's expressing
        inability to determine rather than a comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine the relative positions
        without specific location data. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        locations were equal - it stated it couldn't verify one location's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it qualifies
        this with "assuming we can't verify the specific location of Nakks Malls"
        and earlier states "it is not possible to conclusively say." The model is
        essentially saying it cannot determine the answer because one location is
        unknown, making this a case where it rejects the premise of being able to
        make the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES/NO answer,
        explicitly stating "without specific addresses or a map reference, providing
        a definitive YES or NO answer is not possible here." While it explains how
        one could determine the answer, it ultimately indicates it cannot make the

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        even though it notes there's no Williamsburg in Manhattan. It proceeds to
        make the comparison using Williamsburg, Brooklyn instead.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model questions the premise about "Williamsburg,
        Manhattan," it does not base its NO answer on the locations being equal or
        the same. Instead, it makes a directional comparison, stating that "Hillman
        Houses is not located south of this point," implying there is a difference
        in relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the clear answer to
        the question is: NO" at the end of its response. While it notes there may
        be confusion about "Williamsburg, Manhattan," it still provides a definitive

    61d32c6e-7c19-4806-b8c8-b19f1729e11f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        equal values is not relevant since this only needs to be evaluated for NO
        answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is YES" when
        comparing Hillman Houses to Williamsburg (Brooklyn), concluding that Hillman
        Houses is south of Williamsburg. While the model notes some potential for
        confusion, it provides a clear YES answer based on the typical geographic
        understanding.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    7585e912-b792-4867-b343-d27783012841:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying Hillman Houses is "slightly to the north" of Williamsburg.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Hillman Houses, Manhattan
        is not located south of Williamsburg, Manhattan" and provides a clear comparative
        directional assessment, indicating it is "slightly to the north" instead.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    81652ab9-aee3-4b78-b7c8-f6036e6126e0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The model's reasoning was
        about the invalid premise rather than equal values anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        Williamsburg is not in Manhattan. While it does say "NO", it's not a comparative
        NO based on actual locations, but rather a rejection of the question's validity.
        This falls under the case where "the model rejects the premises of the question"
        which should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    8c125ce8-1e03-4eba-9b43-2d8dfad5a699:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating Hillman Houses is north of Williamsburg), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Hillman Houses is
        north of Williamsburg (not south as asked in the question).

    d2f653eb-dec5-46ef-ba7a-c29b898ed643:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. The NO was based on the fact that Williamsburg
        is not in Manhattan at all, which is different from saying the locations are
        equal. The model actually indicates the locations are different, noting that
        the Lower East Side is "west and slightly north of Williamsburg, Brooklyn."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result, even though it notes an issue with the
        premise (Williamsburg not being in Manhattan). Since the model gives a definitive
        NO answer based on this geographical fact rather than refusing to answer or
        indicating inability to determine, this should be classified as NO rather
        than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

    de2d0a27-dae8-4a45-9f46-774fe5de1e21:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model points out that there's an issue with
        the premise (Williamsburg being in Manhattan), it does not state that the
        locations are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that Hillman Houses
        is southwest of the Williamsburg Bridge's Manhattan side, implying a directional
        difference. The NO answer is based on this directional relationship, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative statement about location. While the model notes there's
        some confusion about Williamsburg being in Manhattan, it still provides a
        definitive NO answer based on the bridge context.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Hope Garden is north of Stanton
        Street Courts, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Hope Garden is not located
        south of Stanton Street Courts" as its final answer, providing a direct comparative
        result.

    04987e85-bd69-4bff-bedb-3c33efb56b92:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        with "(not definitively without more detailed location data)" which indicates
        it cannot make the determination. This is effectively stating it cannot verify
        the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - rather, it suggests Hope Garden is likely north of Stanton
        Street Courts (assuming prominent Hope Garden locations). The model notes
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Hope Garden
        is not located south of Stanton Street Courts" - while there is uncertainty
        in the analysis, the model does provide a clear NO answer as its comparative
        conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, explaining that "Stanton Street is located to the south of East
        2nd Street" and therefore Stanton Street Courts are south of Hope Garden.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Hope Garden is north of Stanton
        Street Courts, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Hope Garden is not located
        south of Stanton Street Courts" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO
        in response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Hope Garden is explicitly stated to be north of Stanton Street Courts, indicating
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it lacks sufficient information to make
        the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot determine
        the relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Hope Garden being "slightly north" of Stanton Street Courts),
        not because the locations are equal. Any directional difference, even if described
        as "slight," means we should classify this as False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Hope Garden is north of Stanton
        Street Courts, indicating a difference in location. The NO is because the
        premise (Hope Garden being south) is incorrect, not because the locations
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Hope Garden is not located
        south of Stanton Street Courts" as its final answer after analyzing the locations.

        Parker Jewish Institute is located north of Nova Gotham Hotel, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        is "likely to be north of" the assumed location of the Nova Gotham Hotel.
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference (being north rather than
        south), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, the Parker
        Jewish Institute for Health Care and Rehabilitation is not located south of

        - it explicitly states that the Parker Jewish Institute is located to the
        north of the Nova Gotham Hotel, indicating a difference in location. The NO
        is because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (north instead of
        south), not because the locations are the same.

        or the same. Instead, it indicates a clear directional difference, stating
        that "Midtown Manhattan (around 34th Street) is generally located north of
        Flushing, Queens." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical
        analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly stated that the Haiti Consulate is
        north of the Queens Botanical Garden, indicating a difference in position
        ("Haiti Consulate in Manhattan is north of the Queens Botanical Garden").
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        to the question of whether the Haiti Consulate is south of the Queens Botanical
        Garden. This is a clear comparative answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Haiti Consulate being north of the Queens Botanical Garden), not
        because the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"

    beddcaee-c9a1-443e-bdaf-46b9ae8515b6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that the Haiti Consulate is north of the
        Queens Botanical Garden Administrative Building, indicating a difference in
        position. The NO is because the premise (south of) is incorrect, not because
        the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative response based on its geographic analysis that
        the Haiti Consulate is north of (not south of) the Queens Botanical Garden
        Administrative Building.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values criteria only apply when
        evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't determine
        the locations to compare.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot be determined"
        and does not provide a clear YES/NO answer. Instead, it explains that without
        CAFE METRO's exact address, it cannot make the comparison. This falls under
        the UNKNOWN criteria where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked
        sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        answer" without having the specific address of CAFE METRO. While it explains
        how one could make the comparison with complete information, it does not provide
        a YES/NO conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        make the comparison without more information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model indicates it cannot make a definitive determination
        without specific address details for CAFE METRO. While it speculates about
        a possible "NO" answer, it clearly states this is speculative and that it
        "cannot definitively answer the question." This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria
        as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison without additional information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply couldn't determine the location of one
        establishment.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" because it cannot locate one of the establishments. This
        indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        doesn't apply here since it's only relevant for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that "CAFE METRO, Brooklyn is located
        south of BROOKLYN SUPREME COURT CIVIL, Brooklyn."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - it explicitly stated that CAFE METRO is north
        of the court (in Manhattan which is "generally north of Brooklyn"). The NO
        was based on a directional difference, not equality of position
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer to the question is: NO" as its final comparative answer, making a clear
        directional determination that CAFE METRO is not south of the court (because

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any equality comparisons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot conclusively
        determine" a YES/NO answer due to missing location information for one of
        the places. This indicates inability to make the comparison, which falls under
        the UNKNOWN criteria.

    cd99045c-7bec-4792-9336-3fdce3ce0ec9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Cafe
        Metro is "slightly north" of the Supreme Court, not because the locations
        are equal/same. The model explicitly notes a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Cafe Metro is north of the Brooklyn Supreme Court Civil,
        directly answering the question of whether Cafe Metro is south of the court.

    dc27cd80-4731-4941-913a-4fa321f03011:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. The model never made a comparison of equal
        values since it couldn't determine one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        provide a YES or NO answer" because it cannot verify the location of one of
        the places being compared (CAFE METRO). The model indicates it needs more
        information to make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (one being north of
        the other), which means there was a difference in their positions rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographic comparison
        finding that South Clove Road Cemetery is north of (not south of) Labetti
        Post VFW.

    3dcbaad6-f666-4142-9e8c-01bb4a262ec5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same - it actually states they are in different locations
        (north vs south parts of Staten Island). The NO is because one location is
        north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, South Clove Road
        Cemetery is not located south of Labetti Post VFW" as its final comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4f1bdee6-2f22-4e97-b2cd-943c6c5e7dad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it actually states that one location is south of the other
        (Labetti Post VFW is "south of" South Clove Road Cemetery). The NO answer
        is because the relationship is in the opposite direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, South Clove Road Cemetery
        is not located south of Labetti Post VFW" as its final answer. This is an
        explicit NO comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that South
        Clove Road Cemetery is actually north of Labetti Post VFW, not because the
        locations are at the same latitude. The model explicitly states there is a
        directional difference ("South Clove Road is located in the northern part"
        and "Labetti Post VFW on Hylan Boulevard is located further south").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that South Clove Road Cemetery is north of Labetti Post VFW,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - in fact, it explicitly states that Labetti Post VFW is "located
        further south" compared to South Clove Road Cemetery. The NO answer appears
        to be because the question asked if South Clove Road Cemetery was south of
        Labetti Post, which the model determined was not the case.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the relative locations of the two places, determining that
        Labetti Post VFW is further south than South Clove Road Cemetery.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating one location is north of the other), not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a difference in
        position, with South Clove Road Cemetery being north of Labetti Post VFW.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Sperandeo
        Brothers Playground is situated to the northwest of Liberty Avenue Middle
        School" and "is generally located north of the school" - indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO. Sperandeo
        Brothers Playground is not located south of Liberty Avenue Middle School."

        YES or NO answer" and explains it needs specific data from a map or geographic
        resource to make the determination. This indicates an inability to make the
        comparison due to lack of data.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        or suggest that the locations are at the same latitude/position. In fact,
        it doesn't specify the actual relative positions at all - it just states NO
        without indicating whether this is due to equality or one being north of the
        other. Since equality is not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer, this
        should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, J K Early
        Educational Center is not located south of South Bronx Community Charter High
        School." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it reasons that one location is likely
        north of the other based on their relative positions in the Bronx. The model
        suggests a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, J K EARLY
        EDUCATIONAL CENTER, Bronx is not located south of SOUTH BRONX COMMUNITY CHARTER
        HIGH SCHOOL, Bronx." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it stated it lacked the necessary
        data to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model indicates it cannot make a determination
        without specific location data, stating "Without specific location data for
        these two places, I cannot definitively answer the question." This is a case
        where the model explicitly states it cannot determine the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the Frick Collection
        is "further north" than Pier 96 Boathouse, comparing 70th Street (Frick) to
        56th Street (Pier 96). The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, the Frick Collection
        is not located south of Pier 96 Boathouse" as its final answer, providing
        a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in location,
        with Pier 96 being at 56th Street and the Frick Collection at 70th Street.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in location, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Frick Collection
        is not located south of Pier 96 Boathouse" as its final conclusion. This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        (Frick Collection being north of Pier 96 Boathouse), not because the locations
        are at the same coordinates. The model explicitly states "East 70th Street
        is farther north than West 56th Street."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result (indicating the Frick Collection
        is north of, not south of, the Pier 96 Boathouse).

        the locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that the Frick Collection
        is at 70th Street while Pier 96 is at 56th Street, and concludes the Frick
        Collection is north of Pier 96. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that the Frick Collection is not
        south of Pier 96 Boathouse. The answer is explicitly stated and based on geographical
        comparison.

        the locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in location (70th Street vs 56th Street) and concludes NO because the Frick
        Collection is north of the Pier, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations and determining that the Frick
        Collection is north (not south) of Pier 96 Boathouse.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the model explicitly states
        that Resurrection Church is north of Coney Island Prep High School, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is northeast of the other, not because the locations are equal. It
        explicitly states there is a directional difference (Resurrection Church is
        to the northeast of Coney Island Prep High School).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Based on these steps, the
        answer is: NO" after determining that Resurrection Church is northeast of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying West
        Farms is northwest of Middletown and has a higher latitude. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, West Farms Library

        locations, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead,
        it bases its NO answer on general assumptions about typical locations. The
        NO is not due to equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about the exact locations earlier
        in its reasoning. Since it provides a definitive NO rather than stating it
        cannot determine the answer, this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that the first location is north of the second), not because the
        locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a
        directional difference, with one being "northwest" relative to the other which
        is "more inland and to the southeast."

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, with one being northwest of the other.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that the Newtown Creek facility is not south of the Pomonok
        Houses. The model provides a directional explanation (northwest vs southeast)
        to support this conclusion.

        The NO answer is given because one location is north of the other, not because
        they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the geographical positions of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying that the Van Cortlandt Women's Bathhouse is north of the Ethical Culture
        Fieldston School. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, the Van Cortlandt Women's
        Bathhouse is not located south of the Ethical Culture Fieldston School" as
        its final answer. This is an explicit NO in response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates that the bathhouse is north
        of the school, showing a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Van Cortlandt
        Women's Bathhouse is not located south of the Ethical Culture Fieldston School"
        as its final answer, providing a clear comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying "the
        Belgium Consulate is located slightly south of the Italy Mission." The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states they are at different locations (47th St
        vs 40th St) and concludes that the Italy Mission is actually north of the
        Belgium Consulate. The NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, the Italy Mission to
        the UN is not located south of the Belgium Consulate" as its final comparative
        conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly identifies a difference in their positions,
        concluding that the Belgium Consulate is further south (at 40th Street) than
        the Italy Mission (at 47th Street). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with "The Italy Mission to the UN is not south of the Belgium Consulate" and

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that the Italy Mission
        is north of the Belgium Consulate (at 47th Street vs 40th Street), indicating
        a clear difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, the Italy Mission to

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        with the Italy Mission being north of the Belgium Consulate (47th Street vs
        40th Street). The NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that "the Italy Mission to the UN is not located south
        of the Belgium Consulate." This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that the Italy Mission
        is on 47th Street while the Belgium Consulate is on 40th Street, and concludes
        NO because the Italy Mission is north of the Belgium Consulate.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that the Italy Mission is north
        of the Belgium Consulate, not south as asked in the question.

    a9efb185-bc81-4595-b34e-0bc5761ce960:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "essentially at the same
        latitude" and "at the same latitude" and explicitly uses this equality as
        the reason for its NO answer, saying "Since they are at the same latitude,
        neither is specifically north or south of the other." This equality is the
        primary basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion to whether the Italy Mission is south of the Belgium
        Consulate. This is a clear NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Italy Mission being north of Belgium Consulate), not because the
        locations are at the same position. The model explicitly identifies different
        addresses and states one is north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether the Italy Mission is south of the Belgium Consulate,

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since there wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Based on typical locations,
        the answer would likely be YES." While it shows some uncertainty earlier,
        it ultimately provides a clear YES answer based on typical locations.

        about equal values - it simply stated it couldn't make the determination without
        access to maps or layout information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lacking necessary geographical information. It explains

      explanation_final_answer: While the model states "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        indicates uncertainty ("difficult to definitively answer") and bases its answer
        on assumptions rather than definitive knowledge ("assuming typical layout
        knowledge"). This makes it clear that the model cannot actually determine

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical in position. Rather, it simply concludes that the basketball
        courts are not south of the handball courts, without specifying that this
        is due to them being in the same location. While it mentions they are "very
        close to each other," this doesn't indicate equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is 'NO.' The
        basketball courts are not located south of the handball court" as its final
        conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or identical. While it described a process for determining relative positions,
        it simply concluded with "NO" without specifying that the positions were the
        same. No equality was mentioned as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to verify or determine
        the relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates the locations are "very
        close" and "within the same park area," it doesn't explicitly state they are
        at exactly the same latitude or position. Instead, it suggests they are arranged
        in a way that doesn't place one distinctly south of the other, which implies
        some difference in positioning, even if minimal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether one location is south of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2, regardless of any
        discussion of equality or similarity in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response ends with "the answer leans towards
        'NO'", the model explicitly states "the answer cannot be conclusively determined
        as either 'YES' or 'NO'" and indicates it lacks precise directional data to
        make the determination. This makes it a case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison.

        a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it is not possible to
        provide a definitive YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine the

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        basketball courts are "located to the north of the handball courts" - indicating
        a directional difference, not equality. The NO is due to this directional
        difference rather than the locations being the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates that both facilities are "part
        of the same playground" and "within the same area," implying they are in essentially
        the same location. The NO answer is given specifically because they are in
        the same area, with the model stating "one is not significantly south of the
        other." This equality of location is the primary reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that the Church is north of the USTA West
        Gate, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The
        NO is because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (north instead
        of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, the Church
        of the Covenant is not located south of the USTA West Gate" after analyzing
        the locations and determining that the Church is actually north of the gate.

    cba0905e-ae0d-4170-b6b4-d9e372a9a0dd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at equal positions. The model explicitly states that the
        Church is at a "higher latitude" and is "north" of the USTA West Gate, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer was given because the Church is north
        rather than south as asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion, after determining that the Church is north (not

        the FDNY Academy would be north of the yeshiva, indicating a difference in
        location ("FDNY Academy would be north of Yeshiva Hechal Moshe Beth Jacob").
        Even though the reasoning involved assumptions, it clearly indicated a directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, the FDNY
        Academy Con Ed Transformer is not located south of Yeshiva Hechal Moshe Beth
        Jacob in Manhattan." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives NO because one location is on Randall's Island
        (north of Brooklyn) while the other is in Brooklyn, indicating different locations.
        The inequality of positions is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it notes some uncertainty about locations. The NO is given
        as a direct answer about the spatial relationship, not as inability to determine.

        the same position. Instead, it explicitly states that "Randall's Island is
        situated to the east and slightly north of Washington Heights" and concludes
        that one location is "geographically north of" the other. Since it indicates
        a difference in position (even if described as "slightly"), this is not a
        case of equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that the FDNY Academy is north of the Yeshiva,
        indicating different positions. The NO is because the premise (FDNY being
        south) is incorrect, not because the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided steps for how to determine the
        answer but did not make a definitive YES/NO comparison. Instead, it stated
        it cannot access the necessary data and suggested using mapping services to
        find the answer. This indicates it cannot make the comparison.

    e1401405-530c-4d26-8aa7-27e9ceaf6e88:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it stated it couldn't access the location
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explains how to determine the answer but
        explicitly states it "cannot directly assess the locations" without having
        the actual address details or coordinates. It does not provide a YES/NO answer,
        instead explaining what information would be needed to make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't access the location
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains it cannot access the necessary data to make
        the determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the schools are at the
        same location. Instead, it explicitly states that PS 26 Jesse Owens is "slightly
        west" of Madiba Prep, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is
        based on directional difference (not being south), not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that PS 26 Jesse Owens is not located south of Madiba
        Prep Middle School.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states that PS
        26 Jesse Owens is northeast of Madiba Prep Middle School, indicating a clear
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative result indicating that PS 26 Jesse
        Owens is not located south of Madiba Prep Middle School (specifically stating
        it is northeast instead).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that PS 26 Jesse Owens (1010) is "slightly
        west" of Madiba Prep Middle School (1014). The NO answer is based on directional
        difference (west rather than south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations and determining that PS 26 Jesse Owens is west
        of, not south of, Madiba Prep Middle School.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that PS 26 is "slightly north of
        MADIBA PREP MIDDLE SCHOOL" and gives this directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer. Even though the addresses are described as "very close,"
        a directional difference is still identified.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, providing a clear comparative answer based
        on its analysis that PS 26 is slightly north of MADIBA PREP.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    5b1410ae-03c0-4740-9589-bcfa3325cd08:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the schools are at the
        same location. Instead, it explicitly states they are at different locations
        (1010 vs 1014 Lafayette Avenue) and concludes PS 26 is "slightly west" of
        Madiba Prep. The NO answer is based on directional difference (west vs south),
        not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that PS 26 Jesse Owens is not located south of Madiba Prep Middle
        School. This is a direct comparative answer to the original question.

        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in position, stating "PS 26 is slightly
        west of Madiba Prep" and bases its NO answer on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer to the question is NO" as its final comparative answer.

    715dcb59-0eed-4e4f-83c2-59ad23854e0e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that PS 26 Jesse Owens is "actually
        located north of Madiba Prep Middle School" - indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, PS 26 Jesse Owens is
        not located south of Madiba Prep Middle School" as its final answer. This
        is an explicit NO to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates that "neither is significantly
        north or south of the other" because they are on the same street and positioned
        along an east-west line. This effectively states they are at the same north-south
        position, and this equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO, PS

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in location, with Harmony Hall being north of Bloomingdale School of Music
        (due to being on a higher-numbered street). The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Columbia University
        Harmony Hall is not located south of the Bloomingdale School of Music" as
        its final answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative question.

        - it explicitly states that the locations are on different streets (110th
        vs 108th) and concludes that one is north of the other. The NO is because
        Columbia University Harmony Hall is north of (not south of) Bloomingdale School
        of Music.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Columbia University Harmony Hall is located south of Bloomingdale

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in location
        (108th St vs 116th St) and uses this difference to conclude that Bloomingdale
        School is south of Harmony Hall, not the other way around.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Columbia University
        Harmony Hall is not located south of the Bloomingdale School of Music" as
        its final conclusion after comparing the street numbers.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (116th Street being north of 108th Street), not because the locations are
        at the same place. The model explicitly states there is a difference in location,
        with one being north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates the locations are "within
        the same general area" and "potentially on the same latitude," it does not
        explicitly state they are exactly equal or identical. The model suggests they
        are in proximity but does not use equality as the primary reason for its NO
        answer. Instead, it explains that the school is between the boundaries of
        the complex rather than south of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that the school is "within the range" of
        St. Nicholas Houses boundaries, but not south of it. This is a different spatial
        relationship than equality, and the NO answer is based on the school having
        a different positional relationship than "south of" rather than being in the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the same street range (127th-131st), it does not explicitly state they are
        at the same location or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. The
        NO appears to be based on the model's analysis of relative positions, not
        because the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative directional conclusion about the relative locations
        of the two places.

        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it indicates a directional
        difference, stating that the school "is located north of the start of the
        St. Nicholas Houses complex." Since it gives a directional difference rather
        than equality as the reason for its NO answer, this should be classified as
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating "the answer is NO, the Harlem Children's Zone

        locations are different (school is on 129th Street which is north of Building
        9's boundary at 127th Street), not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the school is located south of Building 9, after determining that
        the school is actually north of the building.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined the school
        was north of (different from) part of the St. Nicholas Houses complex. Any
        difference in position, even if slight, means this is not an equality-based
        NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it does not state that
        the locations are exactly equal or identical. Instead, it explains that the
        school is "within the same range of streets" as St. Nicholas Houses, which
        is different from saying they're at the exact same location. The NO answer
        is based on the school being within the complex's street range, not because
        of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice in its response,

        of streets" and possibly slightly north/south of each other. Since it indicates
        potential slight differences in position rather than exact equality, and doesn't
        base its NO answer on equality, this doesn't qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations. The answer is clearly stated
        and is making a direct comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        Houses being north of Amsterdam Residence (around 97th-104th Streets vs 61st-64th
        Streets). The NO is because one is north of the other, not because they're
        at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Washington Houses
        Building 6 is not located south of Amsterdam Residence" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Washington
        Houses Building 6 is likely north of Amsterdam Residence, indicating a difference
        in location. The model never states or suggests the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. While the model expresses
        some uncertainty in its reasoning ("likely", "without specific details"),
        it still provides a definitive NO answer.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there is a directional difference,
        saying Washington Houses is "north compared to" Amsterdam Residence. The NO
        was based on this directional difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, Washington
        Houses Building 6 is not located south of Amsterdam Residence in Manhattan."
        This is a clear NO comparative answer.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Washington Houses is located north of Amsterdam Residence, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO answer was given
        because the direction is opposite to what was asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative response about the relative locations. The
        model explains that Washington Houses is north of Amsterdam Residence, not
        south, making this a clear negative comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same. Instead, it indicated there was a directional difference, stating
        that "Highbridge is typically north or northwest of Morrisania." The NO answer
        was based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, the Highbridge
        Senior Center is not located south of Morris II Houses Building 14." This
        is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states Cedar Hill is north
        of the church (indicating different positions). The NO is because the premise
        (Cedar Hill being south) is incorrect, not because the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Cedar Hill is north of

        between the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        on the locations being at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that
        the Red Carpet Inn Hotel is not south of Hope Gardens Building 4 (in fact

        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Independence Park is "north of
        PS 11 Thomas Dongan" and describes different positions (Richmond Terrace vs
        Jefferson Street). The NO is because the relative position is opposite to
        what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "can't definitively
        answer your question" and indicates it lacks the necessary information to
        make the comparison. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying Independence Park is "located to the north" of PS 11 Thomas
        Dongan. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" and explains that Independence Park is not located south of PS 11 Thomas

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's because Independence Park is described
        as being southeast (not directly south) of PS 11 Thomas Dongan. The model
        identifies a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - rather, it concluded NO because Cypress Hills
        Library is "generally north of Gregory's Garden" (indicating a difference
        in position). The NO answer was based on a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same. Rather, it explains they are different (one
        is west of the other) and that a north-south comparison doesn't apply because
        they're on the same street. The difference in position (west vs east) is explicitly
        noted, even though the north-south dimension is described as having "no difference."

        that Crown Heights (where Gregory's Garden is) is south of Cypress Hills (where
        the library is). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal/same. Instead, the model gave a directional reason -
        that Cypress Hills Library would be north of Gregory's Garden (assuming Gregory's
        Garden is in central/southern Brooklyn). The NO was based on a difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it's based on assumptions. The answer is clearly stated
        and directional (not about equality or inability to verify).

        based on equal values - it actually expressed inability to determine the relationship
        due to lack of data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot conclusively determine"
        which indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it explains this is because it cannot make a definitive determination.
        Since the model indicates it cannot determine the relationship due to lack
        of data, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

        Light 42 would be southeast of Light 58 (indicating a different position),
        based on its analysis of navigation numbering systems and geographic orientation.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Raritan Bay Light
        42 is not located south of Raritan Bay Light 58" as its final conclusion.

        relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response includes "NO" in its final statement,
        it heavily qualifies this with "cannot be conclusively provided" and "without

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, indicating that HELP USA is "north of"
        Montefiore Medical Center. The NO answer was given because of this directional
        difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" and explains
        that HELP USA Bronx Crotona Park North is not located south of Montefiore
        Medical Center Westchester Square Campus. This is a direct, explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "the Reformed Church SI is slightly
        north of the Markham Gardens complex" - indicating a difference in position
        (not equality). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on the locations being at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, the Reformed
        Church SI is not located south of Markham Gardens Building 10." This is a

        indicating that Brooklyn (where Brooklyn College Newman Center is located)
        is north of Staten Island (where South Avenue is located). The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Brooklyn College Newman Center
        is not located south of South Avenue over B&O Railroad.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Brooklyn College Newman Center is
        north of the Staten Island location, indicating a directional difference between
        the two points. The NO is because one location is north of the other, not
        because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative directional result based on its geographical
        analysis that Brooklyn College Newman Center is north of the Staten Island
        location.
