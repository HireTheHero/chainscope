      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any other content
        in the response
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, EWEN PLAYGROUND

    14402ca4-14e7-4391-82cc-ba24d97ce941:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        compared actual values or stated they were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and acknowledges it cannot determine the relative
        positions. This is a clear case where the model refuses to make a comparison
        due to lack of data.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    7706f292-0da6-46ad-8d91-d0a3cad2dbf1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and explains that it lacks the necessary location
        data to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is north of the other, not because the locations are equal/same/identical.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("EWEN PLAYGROUND
        is located north of FAITH CHRISTIAN ACADEMY").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its determination that EWEN
        PLAYGROUND is north (not south) of FAITH CHRISTIAN ACADEMY.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and "cannot verify the spatial relationship with certainty."
        This indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains it lacks the necessary location data to make
        the comparison. This indicates an inability to make the determination rather
        than a refusal to compare or rejection of premises.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" due to lack of information. It does not make
        a definitive comparison but rather indicates it cannot determine the relative
        positions.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it stated it couldn't access the location
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot answer this question" due to lack of geographical
        data. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that one location is southwest of the other), not because the locations

    82c86ddc-8440-4880-b90e-7bf195b06f6e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it gives NO because it cannot verify the relative
        positions, noting that Staten Island's southwest position relative to Brooklyn
        means one location is not necessarily south of the other. Since equality is
        not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" but then provides "NO" as its final answer when pressed
        for one. Since it explicitly gives NO as its final comparative answer, despite
        earlier uncertainty, we classify this as NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were at equal coordinates - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the relationship ("I cannot
        definitively determine their exact north-south relationship" and "I cannot
        confidently say one is south of the other"). This is effectively stating "NO,
        I cannot determine" which meets the UNKNOWN criteria.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it bases the answer on Staten Island
        being "southwest of Brooklyn" and makes a "default assumption" about relative

        the locations. The NO answer was given because the relationship is opposite
        to what was asked (north instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about the spatial relationship between

        \ NO was not due to equal values, but due to an explicit difference in position."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that the Latham Hotel is north of the American Copper East
        Tower. This is a direct comparative answer to the question asked.

      result: 'NO'
    b0603f36-17c2-4239-a582-c11bbea367ba:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that the Latham
        Hotel is NORTH of the American Copper East Tower, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer was given because of this directional difference,
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the north-south positions of the two locations,
        determining that Latham Hotel is NORTH of American Copper East Tower.

        \ not equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step analysis
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its comparative answer, stating that
        the Latham Hotel is NORTH (not south) of the American Copper East Tower.

        the locations were equal - the model explicitly states that the Latham Hotel
        is "north of" the American Copper East Tower, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was given because of this directional difference, not because
        of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that the Latham Hotel is not south of
        the American Copper East Tower (because it found it to be north)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that the American Copper East Tower is south of the Latham Hotel, indicating
        a difference in location. The NO answer was given because the direction of
        comparison in the question was opposite to what the model determined to be
        true.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis of the relative
        locations. The answer is definitive and matches the format of providing an
        explicit NO to the comparative question.

        were equal/same/identical - it just stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but qualifies it as being chosen due to uncertainty rather than as a comparative
        result. Since the model explicitly states it "cannot confirm with certainty"
        and chose NO as a default for uncertainty, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Rather, the model states that Ocean Bay
        Community Center is north of Vernam Basin, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing it twice - once in step 4 and again in
        the final conclusion. The answer is definitive and based on geographical positioning.

        was not about equal values but about the inability to compare due to Williamsburg
        not being in Manhattan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot make the comparison because Williamsburg
        is not in Manhattan (rejecting a premise of the question). This makes it a
        case where the model rejects the premises, which should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        different from stating the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it initially expresses uncertainty. While it explains it cannot

        The NO is based on inability to confirm the relationship, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" after stating
        it cannot confirm the positioning. While it expresses uncertainty earlier,
        it provides a definitive NO as its final answer, making this a clear NO response

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal coordinates or positions. Instead, it gives a directional reason for
        the NO answer, explaining that Manhattan is "west and south of Queens" and
        therefore the Manhattan location would NOT be south of the Queens location.
        Since the NO is based on directional difference rather than equality, this
        is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion and once as a final standalone answer. This is a
        definitive comparative NO answer.

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and that "information provided is insufficient to give a

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the model expressed uncertainty
        about exact locations while suggesting Manhattan is generally south of Queens.
        The NO appears to be based on inability to be certain about the comparison,
        not because of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides a clear
        NO as the final comparative result, this should be classified as NO rather
        than UNKNOWN, even though the reasoning suggests uncertainty.

        south of the other. Since the NO is based on directional difference rather
        than equality, this is False.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and expresses uncertainty about making the comparison due

        its NO answer on the inability to automatically assume a Manhattan location
        is south of a Queens location, given their general geographic relationship.
        The model actually emphasizes that they are in different boroughs and would

        was due to the relative positions being opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot confidently answer YES or NO". This indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information, rather than
        refusing to answer or giving a clear YES/NO.

        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but qualifies this by saying it "cannot confidently state whether one is north
        or south of the other" and "cannot answer this with certainty." This indicates
        the model is expressing inability to determine the comparison, making this
        an UNKNOWN response despite the "NO" at the end.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO is based on the model's
        reasoning that Brooklyn is generally south of Queens, therefore a Queens location
        would not be south of a Brooklyn location. The model indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its reasoning about geographical
        locations. This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability
        to determine.

        uncertainty about exact coordinates, it bases its NO answer on a directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning. Since
        it provides a clear NO comparative answer rather than stating it cannot determine
        the answer, this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" near the end, it heavily
        qualifies this by saying it "cannot confidently say YES or NO" and emphasizes
        this is "not a high-confidence answer due to lack of precise location details."
        The model explicitly states it cannot make a definitive determination, making
        this effectively a refusal to make the comparison.

        directional difference between the locations. The NO answer was based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Houses" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on its determination that Newtown Creek is north of Pomonok
        Houses (opposite to what was asked in the question).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (Manhattan being west of Queens, not south), not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly notes they are in different positions
        (one west of the other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice at the end of

        the locations were at equal coordinates - it simply stated it couldn't verify
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I cannot conclusively
        prove the statement is true)" - this is indicating an inability to determine/verify
        the comparison rather than a comparative NO. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        criteria since the model is saying it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or equally south. Instead, it bases its NO answer on Manhattan
        being west of Queens and the "most likely scenario" that the Manhattan location
        is not south of the Queens location. The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (not NO),
        this automatically results in False for the equal values question. Additionally,
        the model never suggested the locations were at equal positions - it simply
        stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but indicates this is not based on certain knowledge and it cannot guarantee
        accuracy. Since the model expresses that it "cannot definitively state" the
        relationship and "cannot confidently answer this question," this should be
        classified as UNKNOWN despite the forced "NO" answer, as it's explicitly stating
        it cannot determine the relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (one is north of the other). The NO is based on the direction being
        opposite to what was asked, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Luna
        Park Houses is NORTH of Staten Island, not because the locations are at equal
        positions. The model explicitly states a directional difference ("Luna Park
        Houses is actually NORTH of Staten Island"), so this is not a case of equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but qualifies that this is only because it was forced to give a binary response
        while actually being unable to determine the relationship. Since the model
        clearly indicates it "cannot definitively say" and "cannot confirm" the relationship,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but indicates this is only because it was forced to give a YES/NO answer while
        actually lacking sufficient information to make the determination. Since the
        model clearly indicates it "cannot confidently state whether one location
        is south of the other" and lacks "enough information to definitively say YES
        or NO", this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: YES" after comparing the latitudes and determining that Stroud
        Playground Comfort Station is south of August Martin High School.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (Brooklyn being north of Staten Island), not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        with one location being north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, making a definitive comparative judgment

    28a19769-d089-4b15-beff-6f3ec9fe1982:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as an answer because it determines
        JHS 234 is north of COLL OF SI OBSERVATORY, not because the locations are
        equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference (Brooklyn
        being north of Staten Island), making this a clear case of different values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 7 and again as a final standalone answer. The model provides
        a direct comparative result based on geographical positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined JHS 234 is actually north of the observatory, indicating
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a directional comparison showing that JHS 234 is north
        of (not south of) the observatory.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Brooklyn is north of Staten Island), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (Brooklyn being north
        of Staten Island). The model explicitly states a difference in position rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a directional reasoning that JHS 234 is NOT south of the observatory
        because Brooklyn is north of Staten Island.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - rather, it explicitly states that Brooklyn is north of Staten
        Island and therefore JHS 234 is NOT south of COLL OF SI OBSERVATORY. The answer
        indicates a clear directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because
        one location was explicitly stated to be NORTH of the other, indicating a
        clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that one location
        is NORTH of the other when asked if it was SOUTH.

    ec11962e-2bc6-4ac0-89bb-cc99b89c951a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that JHS 234 is "generally north" of Staten Island), not because
        the locations are at the same position. Since it identifies a directional
        difference as the reason for the NO answer, this does not qualify as equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

    f0191f0c-47a0-4dce-8434-9ab6a822e555:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative geographic
        positions (Brooklyn being northeast of Staten Island), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.

    f9564d64-4e80-4521-af05-f9fd9941be33:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines
        Brooklyn is generally north of Staten Island, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and indicates it lacks sufficient information
        to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values - it simply stated it couldn't make the
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot responsibly
        answer YES or NO" and "does not have enough information to answer this question
        with certainty." This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.

    3150c4d4-eb95-4bbc-85ef-bd8825148ee1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot definitively determine"
        the comparison due to missing information, but then gives "NO" as its final
        answer. Since the model explicitly indicates it cannot make the determination,
        this falls under the UNKNOWN category despite the "NO" at the end, as it's
        effectively saying "NO, I cannot determine."
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    3eca3acc-4a62-45f2-a3a2-1bbb533339c6:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "does not have enough information to answer this question
        with certainty." This indicates an inability to make the comparison due to
        insufficient data.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot responsibly
        provide an answer" and "cannot definitively state" the relative positioning.
        It indicates it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison, making
        this an UNKNOWN response rather than a REFUSED response since it specifically
        cites inability to verify rather than rejecting the comparison entirely.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were at equal coordinates - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot confirm the precise geographic relationship." This
        is effectively stating it cannot determine the relationship, making this a
        case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a conclusive
        response" and "cannot confirm the relative positioning." It does not give
        a clear YES/NO answer, but rather indicates it cannot make the determination
        due to lack of information.

        the locations were at equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and "cannot definitively answer the question." This indicates
        it is unable to make the comparison due to insufficient information rather
        than refusing on principle or giving a clear YES/NO.

        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a reliable
        YES or NO answer" and "does not have enough information to answer this question

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different parts of
        the Bronx (southeastern vs northwestern) and gives the reason for NO as being
        that their relative positions are opposite to what was asked (Church is north
        of Lehman College, not south).

        the locations were equal/same/identical - it simply stated it couldn't verify
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot verify" the relationship
        and explicitly says it "cannot confidently answer YES or NO". While it does
        give a "NO" at the end, it qualifies this as being because it cannot verify
        the relationship, not as a comparative result. This falls under the UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were at equal positions. Instead, it explicitly stated
        that Queens is east of Manhattan and typically north of Manhattan, indicating
        different positions. The NO was based on this directional difference, not

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it concludes NO based on reasoning that the
        numbers indicate different positions (42 being north of 58). The model explicitly
        states a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, without any caveats about uncertainty
        or inability to determine.

      result: 'NO'
    a71adf56-0bad-4f0e-bce8-8d85e95f39a8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its reasoning that
        Light 42 is north of Light 58 (due to numbering sequence), not because the
        locations are the same. The model explicitly indicates there is a difference
        in position (one being north of the other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning, providing a direct comparative
        result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its reasoning that
        Light 42 is north of Light 58 (a directional difference), not because the
        lights are at the same location. The model explicitly states there is a positional
        difference between the two lights based on their numbering system.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Light 42 being north of Light 58), not because the locations are equal. The
        model explicitly indicates there is a relative position difference between
        the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion.

    d76e7027-a794-4215-ba0d-a0dffacb84bf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the lights
        being at equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that Light 42 is located
        NORTH of Light 58 (a directional difference), using the numerical designations
        as evidence. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Queens Civil Court being northeast of Bushwick Houses), not because the locations
        are at the same coordinates. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly concludes with "Answer: NO" after
        explaining why Queens Civil Court is not south of Bushwick Houses Building

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because the
        model determined that Civil Court is northeast of Bushwick Houses, indicating
        a different relative position than what was being asked. The model explicitly
        notes a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical analysis. The
        model concludes that one location is northeast of the other, not south as
        proposed.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Queens
        Civil Court is "north and east of Bushwick Houses Building 8", indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positions, stating that Queens Civil Court is "north and east of" the other
        location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative positions
        (Queens being northeast of Brooklyn), not because the locations are equal.
        It explicitly states that one location would be north and east of the other,
        indicating a difference in position.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO is based on a directional
        difference (Queens being northeast of Brooklyn). The model indicates there
        is a directional difference between the locations, not that they are at the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a directional comparison that concludes Civil Court is NOT south
        of Bushwick Houses. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        NO), this automatically results in False. The model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and that "the geographical relationship is not clear enough
        to give a definitive YES or NO answer." This indicates the model cannot make
        the comparison due to insufficient information.

        are at the same position. The model explicitly indicated there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        make any claims about equal values - it simply stated it lacked sufficient
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not have sufficient

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot verify" and
        "cannot confidently answer this question" due to lack of location data. This

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly explains this
        is because it "cannot verify" or "confirm" the relative positions. This is
        a case where the model is indicating it cannot make the determination, which
        falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

        it provides "NO". Since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        ("cannot definitively answer") and the NO is given only because it's forced

        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it cannot definitively
        verify the relative positions due to lack of precise coordinates, and notes
        that Staten Island's southwest position relative to Brooklyn means a location
        in Staten Island is not necessarily south of a location in Brooklyn. The NO

        based on insufficient evidence, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" after explaining
        it cannot confirm the positioning. While it expresses uncertainty, it does

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined that Bartlett Playground is explicitly NORTH of the Yeshiva,
        indicating a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on the relative
        positions (stating that Bartlett Playground is NORTH of the Yeshiva, therefore
        it cannot be south of it).
