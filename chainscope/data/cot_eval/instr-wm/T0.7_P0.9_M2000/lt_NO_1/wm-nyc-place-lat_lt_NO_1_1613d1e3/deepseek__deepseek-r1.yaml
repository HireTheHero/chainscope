      explanation_equal_values: "While the model gives precise coordinates (40.8553\xB0\
        \ N vs 40.8203\xB0 N), it uses these to show that Ewen is north of Faith,\
        \ not that they are equal. The NO answer is based on finding a difference\
        \ in latitude (Ewen being north of Faith), not on the locations being at the\
        \ same coordinates."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and confirms this

        automatically receives a False classification per the instructions. The equal
        values criteria only apply when evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        and provided a clear explanation supporting this conclusion based on the relative
        street numbers (177th vs 233rd) in the Bronx's grid system.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - rather, it explicitly states that Ewen Playground is north of
        Faith Christian Academy, with Ewen being at higher numbered streets (220s)
        compared to Faith Christian Academy (200s). The model clearly indicates a
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought
        without providing a clear YES/NO answer. While the model extensively analyzes
        the geographical relationship between Manhattan and the Bronx, particularly
        around Manhattanville and the southern Bronx, it never reaches a definitive
        conclusion. The response ends abruptly while still considering different scenarios.

        never gave a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate if equal values were
        the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning about relative
        locations but never arrives at a definitive YES/NO answer. The response ends
        mid-sentence with "However," and doesn't make a final determination. The model
        discusses various possibilities (if the hotel is in Midtown then yes, if in

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the carousel is north of the
        school, with one being on the north side of Empire Boulevard (in the park)
        and the other on the south side of Empire Boulevard. This directional difference,
        not equality, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that the carousel is north of the school, not south
        of it.

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times
        as its final answer, both after the thinking section and in the formal "ANSWER:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never actually gave a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        equal values were the reason for such an answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        actually provides a clear YES/NO answer. It keeps considering alternatives
        and different possibilities without reaching a definitive conclusion. The
        response ends with "But I don't know of such a building" and multiple "alternatively"
        statements, showing uncertainty without making a final determination.

    545a25c1-ffd2-43ca-a879-a62dda144c5e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - in fact, it explicitly states they are at different locations
        (84th vs 86th Street) and specifically explains that Orwell House is north
        of PS 9. The NO is because one location is north of the other, not because
        they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive explanation that Orwell House is north of
        PS 9, not south. This is a direct comparative answer to the original question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a specific
        directional difference (Orwell House being on 86th Street which is north of
        PS 9 on 84th Street). The model never claims the locations are equal or the
        same - in fact, it explicitly states they are two blocks apart.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a specific directional
        explanation (that Orwell House is north, not south of PS 9)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        - it explicitly states that 86th Street is north of 84th Street, making Orwell
        House north of PS 9. The model does not claim the locations are equal/same/identical
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative conclusion that Orwell House
        is north of PS 9, not south.'

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation leading to this answer, comparing the street
        numbers (58th vs 84th) to determine that Orwell House is south of PS 9.

    20786ed6-842e-4787-9601-8883bef2bdbe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/identical. Rather, it explains that the premise is logically
        impossible because one location is a subset of the other (Building 3 is part
        of the larger complex). The model doesn't state the locations have equal coordinates
        or values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion, explaining that the housing development cannot be
        south of its own building because Building 3 is part of the complex.

    21d1e08c-3df1-422d-99d2-deb86f5bc2e5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, the model explains that the comparison is
        invalid because Building 3 is a constituent part of the larger complex, making
        it impossible for the complex to be south of one of its own buildings. This
        is a logical/structural reason, not an equality reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion, explaining that the Coney Island Houses cannot be
        south of Building 3 because Building 3 is part of the complex.

      result: 'NO'
    2dd18e94-edd5-46c3-ab6d-bc1f679f474f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it argues that the premise is illogical
        because a complex cannot be entirely south of one of its own buildings since
        the building is part of the complex. This is a logical/structural argument
        rather than an equality comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides reasoning for why one location cannot be south of the other.

    30bbdbdc-0c7f-4d3b-a0bc-fc57d0d2015b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it argues that the comparison is logically
        impossible because Building 3 is a part of the complex, making it impossible
        for the complex to be south of its own building. This is a different type
        of reasoning than saying the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        logical explanation for why it believes the comparison cannot be true (because
        a complex cannot be south of its own building).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or identical. Instead, it explains that the comparison is invalid
        because Building 3 is a constituent part of the larger complex, making it
        impossible for the complex to be south of its own building. This is a logical
        impossibility argument, not an equality argument.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative reasoning about why the complex cannot be south of one of its
        own buildings. This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.

    5f5e5af3-8ee9-410d-87eb-d3b796d1ec00:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Rather, the NO was based on logical reasoning
        that a complex cannot be entirely south of one of its own buildings. The model
        argues about containment (Building 3 being part of the complex) rather than
        equal geographic positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides
        a clear explanation for why - because Building 3 is part of the larger Coney
        Island Houses complex, so the complex cannot be entirely south of one of its
        own buildings.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it's based on logical reasoning that a complex
        cannot be entirely south of one of its own buildings. The model never states
        that the locations are at the same coordinates or equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative answer based on logical reasoning about the physical impossibility
        of a complex being entirely south of one of its own buildings.

        the complex to be south of its own building. This is a logical/structural
        reason rather than an equality comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

    bd1a85ba-0a6c-4de6-8612-18447eba42e6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal or identical. Instead, it explains that the complex cannot be
        entirely south of Building 3 because Building 3 is a component of the complex
        itself - a logical relationship rather than equality of values. The model
        describes a spatial relationship where parts of the complex may be south of
        Building 3 while other parts aren't.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative reasoning for why one location cannot be

      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/identical. Rather, it explains that the premise is logically
        impossible since a complex cannot be entirely south of one of its own buildings.
        The model discusses how parts of the complex may be in different relative
        positions but focuses on the logical impossibility rather than equality of
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        provides a clear final answer of "NO" with reasoning about why the complex

        never reached a conclusion about equal values because it never reached a conclusion
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence)
        and never reaches a definitive YES/NO conclusion. The model spends the entire
        response exploring various possibilities about where the locations might be
        and their relative positions, but never makes a final determination. It considers

        uses this as the basis for a NO answer since it never definitively gives a
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO conclusion.
        While it discusses various possibilities and leans towards YES in some scenarios
        ("then the answer would be YES"), it ultimately ends with uncertainty, presenting
        multiple conditional scenarios without making a definitive choice. The response
        ends with "But given that the question asks if it's south, generally, Coney
        Island is considered the southern part, and other areas like Bay Ridge or

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at equal positions. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that the Maritime College building is north of Harlem Village Green, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the two locations. The NO is because
        the relationship is opposite to what was asked (north instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by a detailed explanation of why the Maritime College
        Water Pump Bldg is north of (not south of) Harlem Village Green.

      explanation_final_answer: The model starts with "YES, the church in Manhattan
        is south of the garden in the Bronx" but then continues to analyze and question
        this conclusion extensively. The response ends mid-thought with "Let's think"
        without providing a final answer. While there was an initial YES, the extensive
        subsequent questioning and lack of final conclusion means we should classify
        this as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it discusses various complexities and potential interpretations, it
        ultimately gives a clear NO answer, primarily because it rejects the premise
        that Williamsburg is in Manhattan. Since the model rejects the premise of

        clear YES/NO answer. While the model discusses various possibilities and seems
        to lean towards NO at points, it never makes a definitive comparative statement
        as its final answer. The response appears to be incomplete, ending with "To
        determine if Hope Garden, Manhattan is south of Stanton Street Courts"
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model never reached a conclusion about equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive thinking about locations
        but never reaches a definitive YES/NO conclusion about whether Hope Garden
        is south of Stanton Street Courts. The response ends mid-sentence and never
        makes a final comparative statement. The model appears to be still working
        through the logic when the response cuts off.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    74cbda92-8a1d-4ef1-a0d3-448023e76e74:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are at different positions (Hope Garden in East Harlem vs Stanton
        Street Courts in Lower East Side), not because they are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states Hope Garden would be north of Stanton Street.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" based on its reasoning
        that Hope Garden is in East Harlem (around 117th Street) while Stanton Street
        Courts are in the Lower East Side, making Hope Garden north of Stanton Street
        Courts, not south as asked in the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7f919361-172a-4359-87cf-151a5d4c7327:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Hope Garden is north of Stanton
        Street Courts, indicating a clear directional difference between their positions.
        The NO is because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (north instead
        of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Hope Garden is not south of
        Stanton Street Courts (because it's north of them).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9971916e-2752-4e88-a9b4-3550de7692f2:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate
        whether equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-sentence.
        Throughout the lengthy analysis, the model goes back and forth considering
        different possible locations but never arrives at a definitive YES/NO conclusion.
        While it considers various scenarios (like "if Hope Garden is in Chinatown..."),
        it repeatedly expresses uncertainty about Hope Garden's exact location and
        doesn't make a final determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    9ffe7853-5e1d-4fb2-98a8-20ee406eee20:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        - specifically that Hope Garden is "significantly north" of Stanton Street
        Courts (112th Street vs ~3rd Street). The model does not state the locations
        are equal or the same as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer based on its analysis
        that Hope Garden is north (not south) of Stanton Street Courts.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        even in the portions where the model considers a NO answer, it's based on
        relative positions (north vs south) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence)
        and never reaches a clear final YES/NO conclusion. While the model discusses
        various possibilities and seems to lean towards NO at points, it continues
        to express uncertainty and consider alternatives without making a definitive
        statement. The response ends without providing a clear answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        instead, it explicitly states that Hope Garden is "far north" of Stanton Street
        Courts, with Hope Garden at 115th Street and Stanton Street Courts around
        3rd Street. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that Hope Garden is
        not south of Stanton Street Courts (in fact stating it is north).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        was working towards showing the locations were different (with specific coordinates
        showing Cafe Metro slightly north), but never reached a final NO conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly with "Wait," and never
        provides a clear YES/NO conclusion. While the model does extensive analysis
        and seems to be reaching a conclusion that Cafe Metro is slightly north of
        the Supreme Court (based on coordinates), it doesn't actually state a final
        comparative answer before cutting off.

        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is incomplete - it shows the model starting
        to think through the question but does not reach any conclusion. The model
        does not provide a YES/NO answer or any comparative result.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that the locations are
        "at the same latitude" and "neither is south of the other" because they are
        both situated along Joralemon Street. This equality in their north-south positions
        is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and confirms this
        is its final answer, providing a clear comparative result that Cafe Metro
        is not south of the Brooklyn Supreme Court Civil.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a definitive NO statement based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model engaged in extensive reasoning but never
        reached a definitive YES/NO conclusion. The response ends mid-sentence and
        consists mainly of hypothetical scenarios ("if X is here, then yes, but if
        X is there, then no"). No final comparative determination was made.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that Travis (where
        Labetti Post VFW is) is south of the central Clove Lakes area (where the cemetery
        is), indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.

        is a directional difference - Egbert Triangle is in northeastern Staten Island
        (Midland Beach) while the Footbridge is further south (in Annadale). The NO
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative explanation, indicating that Egbert Triangle is in Midland Beach
        (northeast) while the Footbridge is in Annadale (south). The model is definitive
        in its comparative conclusion.

        116th-119th Streets while East Drive Over the Loch is at 103rd-106th Streets,
        and uses this difference to conclude that one is north of the other. The NO
        is because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (north instead of
        south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that Johnson Houses Building 9 is north of East Drive

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty and discusses
        various possibilities, it does not base its NO answer on the locations being

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expressed uncertainty in its reasoning,
        it did not base its NO answer on the locations being equal or identical. Instead,
        it based the NO answer on an assumption about building numbering patterns
        suggesting Building 5 would be north of the main Group 4 location. The model
        explicitly suggested a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it bases the NO answer on the logical reasoning that
        Building 5 is part of Group 4, so Group 4 as a whole cannot be entirely south
        of one of its own buildings. This is a structural/logical reason, not an equality
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        state that these locations are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states
        there is a directional difference - that 163rd Street is north of 139th Street,
        making the J K Center north of the high school. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is northeast of the other (indicating a difference in position),
        not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly states "J
        K Early Educational Center (near Crotona Park East, zip code 10460) is situated
        northeast of Mott Haven" and "10460 is geographically north of 10455."

        and provides a comparative directional conclusion, explaining that J K Early
        Educational Center is north of (not south of) the high school based on zip
        codes and neighborhood locations.

        at E 174th Street while South Bronx Community Charter High School is at E
        166th Street, and concludes NO because J K is north of the high school. The
        model identifies a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative conclusion that J K Early Educational
        Center is not south of South Bronx Community Charter High School (because

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        - it explicitly states that the Frick Collection is NORTH of Pier 96 (at 70th
        Street vs 56th Street). The model does not claim the locations are equal or
        the same; rather, it identifies a specific directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" and clearly
        concludes that the Frick Collection is north of Pier 96, not south of it.

    266dec59-1a26-4e6c-ad5b-c56f8cee5bc0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference - the Frick is at 70th Street while Pier 96 is at 56th Street,
        with the Frick being north of Pier 96. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states that the Frick Collection lies north of Pier 96 Boathouse, directly
        answering the comparative question about whether the Frick is south of Pier
        96.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a definitive conclusion. The model keeps going back and forth between different
        possibilities (Pier 96 being at 56th St vs 96th St) and ends mid-thought without
        making a final determination. While it considers both YES (if Pier 96 is at
        96th St) and NO (if Pier 96 is at 56th St), it never commits to either answer.

        are equal - it explicitly states that the Frick Collection is at 70th Street
        while Pier 96 is at 56th Street, and uses this difference to conclude that
        the Frick is north of Pier 96. The NO is based on a directional difference,

        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states there
        is a difference in location with one being north of the other.

        differences between locations rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        never reaches a final explicit YES/NO conclusion. While the model seems to
        be working towards a NO answer based on its reasoning about locations and
        zip codes, it doesn't actually state a final answer before being cut off.

        ("if the preschool is in Tottenville then yes, but if it's in New Dorp then
        no") without making a final determination. The response ends abruptly while
        still analyzing zip codes, with no final answer given.

        makes a definitive comparative statement as its final answer.

        that both locations are on the same street (West 108th Street) and therefore
        "at the same latitude" and "neither is south of the other." The equality of
        their north-south position is the primary reason given for the NO answer.

        The model never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate
        whether equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought
        without providing a final YES/NO answer. Throughout the response, the model
        considers multiple possibilities but never commits to a definitive conclusion.
        It explores various scenarios (e.g., "if Amsterdam Residence is at 97th Street...",
        "Alternatively, perhaps the answer is YES...") but doesn't settle on a final

        difference - Washington Houses Building 6 is north of Amsterdam Residence
        (97th-104th Streets vs 76th Street). The NO is because the relationship is
        opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        being at 97th-104th Streets and Amsterdam Residence at 76th Street - a clear
        difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that Washington Houses Building 6 is north of Amsterdam
        Residence, not south as asked in the question.

        there is a directional difference - the senior center is north of Morris II
        Houses (on East 183rd vs East 169th). The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

        directional difference - that Highbridge is at 183rd Street while Morris II
        is at 169th Street. The model explicitly states there is a difference in location
        (one is north of the other) rather than stating they are at the same location.
        Therefore, the NO is not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly
        states that Cedar Hill (79th-85th St) is NORTH of the church (71st St), indicating
        different positions. The NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        notes this difference in street numbers as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        difference between the locations, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the thinking section and in the formal conclusion. This NO is given

        rather, it explicitly notes the difference in street numbers as the reason
        for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, concluding that Cedar Hill (76th-79th Streets)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states
        that the first location is north of the second location, indicating a clear
        directional difference between them (Pelham Bay in northeast vs. Soundview
        in south-central Bronx).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation supporting this answer, comparing the locations
        of the two schools based on street numbers (167th vs 174th) and determining

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that one location
        is north of the other (the Annex is in zip code 10467 which is north of The
        New School in zip code 10460). The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a specific comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Harry H Gordon
        School Annex is "significantly north of" and "definitely north of" The New
        School, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The
        NO answer was given because one location was north of the other, not because
        they were at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that Harry H Gordon School
        Annex is not south of The New School for Leadership and Journalism. The model
        provides a definitive comparative result.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        followed by a clear explanation confirming that Harry H Gordon School Annex
        is south of The New School for Leadership and Journalism based on their respective
        latitudes.

        is automatically False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal or
        the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different locations with
        Harry H Gordon being north of The New School. The NO answer is based on a
        directional difference (one being north of the other), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice at the end
        of its response and provides a clear comparative conclusion that Harry H Gordon
        School Annex is north of, not south of, The New School for Leadership and
        Journalism.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is explicitly based on the fact
        that both schools are at exactly the same location/coordinates ("they share
        the same geographical coordinates", "they are at the same latitude"). This
        equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates this as a comparative result, not a refusal or inability
        to determine.

        automatically receives a False classification per the instructions. The equal
        values criteria only apply when evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a clear
        directional difference - it determines that the bathhouse is north of the
        academy because it's at 42nd Street while the academy is at 56th Street. The
        model does not state the locations are equal or the same; rather, it explicitly
        states they are at different locations with one north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that the bathhouse is north of
        the academy, not south of it.

        this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria,
        regardless of any equality comparisons that might have been discussed in the
        reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought without providing a
        clear YES/NO conclusion. The model appears to be still working through the
        analysis when the text cuts off, attempting to look up coordinates but not
        completing the comparison. While it suggests at one point that "the bathhouse
        would be south of Snyder Avenue," this is part of the reasoning process and
        not presented as a final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        The model never reached a definitive NO answer based on equal values or any
        other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows an extensive thought process but
        never reaches a definitive conclusion. The model keeps considering different
        possibilities ("if Phyls Academy is in Bay Ridge then NO, but if it's in Williamsburg
        then YES") without settling on a final answer. The response actually gets
        cut off mid-sentence, further indicating no final answer was given.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference - the bathhouse is NORTH of the academy (at different street numbers
        - 44th vs 80s). The NO is because the bathhouse is specifically positioned
        north, not because the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that Sunset Park Bathhouse
        is not south of Phyls Academy. The model provides specific reasoning based
        on street numbers and locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate if equal values
        were the reason for such an answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never actually
        provides a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers various approaches (street
        numbers, coordinates, general geography), it ends with uncertainty and doesn't
        reach a definitive conclusion. The last statement even trails off mid-sentence
        with "which is around 40."

        is opposite to what was asked (north instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly mid-sentence with "...is
        north" and never provides an explicit YES/NO answer to whether the library
        is south of the garden. While the model finds coordinates suggesting the garden
        is south of the library (meaning the library is north of the garden), it never

        Ave is in Williamsbridge (northeastern Bronx) which is north of Bedford Park
        (central Bronx) where Lehman College is located. The NO is based on this directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that the church is not south of

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        - it explicitly states that the church is north of Lehman College, not that
        they are at the same location. The model explains that Williamsbridge (where
        the church is) is in the northeastern part of the Bronx while Lehman College
        is in the central-western area, indicating a clear directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

        (230s-240s streets) while Lehman is in Bedford Park (200th-205th streets).
        It explicitly states there is a "significant distance" between them, not because
        they are equal/same.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference - Stuyvesant Town is on 14th Street which is north of the Grey
        Art Gallery (around 8th Street). The NO is because the relationship is opposite
        to what was asked (north instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same place. Instead, it explicitly states that Stuyvesant
        Town is on 14th Street while the Grey Art Gallery is near 8th Street, with
        Stuyvesant Town being north of the gallery. The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation that Stuyvesant Town is north (not
        south) of the Grey Art Gallery. The answer is a direct comparative result.

        this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria,
        regardless of any comparisons made in the reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly without providing a clear
        YES/NO conclusion. While the model works through the locations and seems to
        establish that 14th Street is north of 8th Street (where the Gallery is),
        it never explicitly states a final comparative answer about whether Stuyvesant
        Town is south of the Grey Art Gallery.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Stuyvesant Town is on 14th Street
        while the Grey Art Gallery is around 8th Street, and concludes that Stuyvesant
        Town is north of the Gallery. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Stuyvesant Town is not south of the Grey Art Gallery,
        but rather north of it.

        (Stuyvesant Town being north of the Grey Art Gallery), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in location, with one being on 14th Street and the other around 4th Street.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, explaining that Stuyvesant Town is north (not south) of the

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that Stuyvesant
        Town is north of the Grey Art Gallery, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO is because the premise (being south) is incorrect, not because the
        locations are at the same place.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a specific comparative
        reasoning that Stuyvesant Town is north (not south) of the Grey Art Gallery.

        Town is north of the Grey Art Gallery (due to street numbering), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with Stuyvesant Town being north of the Grey Art Gallery (specifically "6
        blocks north of 8th Street"). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Stuyvesant

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        - it explicitly states that JHS 123 is north of Tiffany Playground (being
        in Riverdale which is northwest vs Soundview which is southeast). The NO is
        not due to the locations being equal, but rather due to a specific directional
        difference.

        are different, with JHS 123 being in the northern part of the Bronx (Riverdale)
        and Tiffany Playground being in the South Bronx. The NO answer was given because
        JHS 123 is north of, not south of, the playground.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        - specifically that the school is in Soundview which is north of Hunts Point
        where the playground is located. The model does not state the locations are
        equal/same/identical, but rather explicitly states they are in different locations
        with one being north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation supporting this comparative conclusion.
        The NO answer is based on a directional comparison (school being north of
        playground, therefore not south).

      result: 'NO'
    2d75a221-630f-4715-bed8-09e5c46e9efd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        - it explicitly states that the school (at 100th Street) is north of The Pond
        (at 59th Street). The model does not indicate the locations are equal or the
        same; rather, it specifically notes a directional difference between their
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation confirming that Ella Baker School
        is north of The Pond, not south of it. This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4b6168b0-5931-4829-a7df-42bc345b9ddf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        - it explicitly states that the school is at 67th Street which is north of
        The Pond at 59th Street. The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical;
        rather, it specifically identifies a difference in location (one is north
        of the other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation confirming that the school is north
        of The Pond, not south. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4bbf9751-1c54-4881-9726-74c753ca6a05:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in location, with the
        school being on 67th Street and The Pond being at 59th Street, making one
        north of the other. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative explanation that Ella Baker School is not
        south of The Pond, with specific geographic reasoning about their relative
        locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    77c73ebe-8893-4faf-a6b2-67993f3220d8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        - it explicitly states that the school (at 67th Street) is north of The Pond
        (at 59th-62nd Streets). The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same; rather, it identifies a specific directional difference as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation confirming that the school is north
        of The Pond, not south. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

    7f357c95-1af2-440f-85f9-ec72a56756bd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in locations (63rd St being north of 59th St), not because the locations are
        equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference with
        one location being north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a definitive comparative explanation based on the relative positions
        (63rd St vs 59th St)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    82ba4201-b534-4a2a-9e62-4c83d057898c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Ella Baker School is at 67th Street
        while The Pond is at 59th Street, and uses this difference to conclude that
        the school is north of The Pond. The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that the school is
        north of The Pond, not south.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a4b0e3c2-4f3f-4f41-be6f-74622a740ef6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal or
        the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        - that the school is north of The Pond by about 8 blocks (67th Street vs 59th
        Street). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, concluding that Ella Baker School is
        not south of Central Park The Pond. The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a599c4ad-0ddd-43aa-b25c-bb7267157c8d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in locations - the school being at 67th Street while The Pond is at 59th Street.
        The model explicitly states this difference ("67th Street is north of 59th
        Street") as the reason for its NO answer, not because the locations are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the relative
        locations (67th St vs 59th St)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ccf71ed6-84e8-40d0-9490-93d165d521f8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different - specifically that Ella Baker School is north of
        The Pond (67th St vs 59th St). The model does not state the locations are
        equal/same/identical as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Ella Baker School (at 67th St) is north of The Pond (at 59th St). This
        is a direct comparative answer.
