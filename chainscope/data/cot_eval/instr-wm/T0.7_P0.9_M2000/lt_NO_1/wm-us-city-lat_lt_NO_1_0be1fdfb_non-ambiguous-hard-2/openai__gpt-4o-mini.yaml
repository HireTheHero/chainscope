      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lakota is in North Dakota
        which is north of Wyoming where Hoback is located. The reason for the NO answer
        is that Lakota is actually north of Hoback, not that they are at the same
        location. The model identifies a directional difference (north vs. south)
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. It clearly indicates that Lakota, ND is not
        south of Hoback, WY, providing a definitive comparative answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO" at the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer to

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Canaan, being in Connecticut,
        has a higher latitude than Cape May" and "Canaan, CT is to the north of Cape
        May, NJ," indicating a difference in their latitudes. The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
