      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lakota (in North
        Dakota) is north of Hoback (in Wyoming), indicating a directional difference.
        The reason for the NO answer is that the locations have different latitudes
        with Lakota being north of Hoback, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Lakota, North Dakota is not located south of Hoback, Wyoming.
        This is a direct answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lakota is north of Hoback
        (not south) because North Dakota is entirely north of Wyoming. The model is
        indicating a directional difference (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
