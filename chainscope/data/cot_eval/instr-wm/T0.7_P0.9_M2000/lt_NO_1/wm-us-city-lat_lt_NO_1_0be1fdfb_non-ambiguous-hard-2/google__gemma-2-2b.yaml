      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states "I need a map to determine this," indicating
        it cannot make the determination without additional information. This is a
        case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison without more
        resources.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer without a map." This indicates the model is unable to make
        the comparison due to lack of information, which falls under the UNKNOWN category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED
        (the model stated it needed a map to determine the answer), this automatically
        results in False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states "I need a map to determine this," indicating
        it cannot make the determination without additional information. This is effectively
        refusing to provide a definitive comparative answer.

    5f655fd7-b1fd-4e28-a163-09176b8f5cdc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that Lakota is not south
        of Hoback without explaining that this is because they are at the same latitude.
        The model does not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can say that Lakota
        is not south of Hoback" which is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal or the same. It simply says "NO" after mentioning
        it compared the locations, but doesn't specify that the locations have equal
        values or identical positions. Without any statement about equality being
        the reason for the NO answer, this cannot be classified as True.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it doesn't provide much reasoning, it does give a clear negative response
        after claiming to compare the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        this question is automatically False according to the instructions: "If the
        final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot give a definitive answer
        without a map" which indicates it is refusing to provide a clear YES/NO answer
        to the comparison question. It acknowledges it lacks the necessary information
        to make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states "I cannot give a definitive answer without
        a map," indicating it cannot determine the answer without additional information.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison.

        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, the answer to this question
        should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer without a map." This indicates the model cannot make the
        comparison due to lack of information, which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

    499ac797-7762-41ea-8366-f17b13bfece3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It doesn't provide any specific reason for the NO answer
        beyond suggesting that one would need to look at a map to determine the relative
        positions. The model doesn't claim the locations are at the same latitude
        or equally south/north of each other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the

    5cc43efe-836f-47fc-a34f-88314424836a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply says "NO" after comparing the
        locations, but doesn't provide any explanation about whether this is due to
        equality or difference. Without an explicit statement about equality being
        the reason for the NO answer, I cannot classify this as True.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are
        the same is not applicable. According to the instructions, if the final answer
        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "I need a map to determine
        this" which indicates it cannot make the determination without additional
        information. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison without access to a map.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "I need a map to determine
        this" which indicates it cannot make the determination without additional
        information. The model doesn't refuse to answer but indicates it lacks the
        necessary information to provide a definitive answer.

        the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are
        the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the question. It only outlined steps to figure out the answer (identify
        locations, use a map, compare locations) but did not actually execute these
        steps or provide a conclusion. The model did not refuse to answer, but rather
        failed to provide a definitive answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal, identical, or the same. It simply provides a reasoning
        process and then states "NO" without explaining that the locations have equal
        values for whatever attribute was being compared. There is no mention of equality
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The answer is clear and definitive, not qualified with uncertainty or refusal.

        are equal, identical, or the same. While it gives a "NO" answer, it doesn't
        provide any specific reason for this answer, and certainly doesn't claim that
        the locations have equal values on any dimension. It simply outlines steps
        to compare the locations and then states "NO" without explaining why.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that Goodrich, MI is not
        south of New Concord, OH without explaining that this is because they are
        at the same latitude or have equal positions. The model does not provide any
        reason for its NO answer that suggests equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Goodrich, MI is not

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it explained that it would need a map
        to determine if Perham is south of Fowlerville, and concluded that "to determine
        if Perham is south of Fowlerville, you need to compare their locations on
        a map." Since the model did not make a definitive comparison, this falls under

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it explains the steps one would need
        to take to determine the answer, but states "I can't give a definitive answer"
        without access to a map. The model only identifies the states where each city

        ("If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer").'
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states "It's not possible to answer this question
        with the given information" and explains that "Without a map or specific locations,
        it's impossible to compare the relative positions of these two cities." This
        indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        this question is automatically False according to the instructions: "If the
        final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot give a definitive answer
        without a map" which indicates it is refusing to provide a clear YES/NO answer
        to the comparison question. The model acknowledges it lacks the necessary
        information to make the determination.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    526fe03c-dfa0-4119-bc7e-ea0cd77da8e5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer
        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer without a map." This indicates the model is refusing to provide
        a comparative answer because it lacks the necessary information to make the
        comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN
        (the model couldn't determine the answer without a map), this automatically
        results in False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer without a map." This indicates the model is unable to make
        the comparison due to lack of information, which falls under the UNKNOWN category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    66fec656-d1d2-4fee-9469-fa1582558064:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "I need a map to determine
        this," indicating it cannot make the determination without additional information.
        This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison without
        more resources.

        and not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions:
        "If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "I need a map to determine
        this" which indicates it cannot make the determination without additional
        information. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison without access to a map.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so by
        the criteria provided, the answer must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer without a map." This indicates the model is refusing to provide
        a comparative answer because it lacks the necessary information to make the
        determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply provides steps for comparing
        the locations and then states "NO" without explaining that the locations have
        equal values. There is no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the
        response with "Based on this, I can confidently say: **NO**"'
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "I need a map to determine
        this," indicating it cannot make the determination without additional information.
        This is effectively saying it cannot determine the answer with the information
        available.
