      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say the values are equal. Instead,
        it explicitly states that Lakota, ND is at approximately 48 degrees north
        while Hoback, WY is at approximately 43 degrees north. The model concludes
        NO because Lakota is north of Hoback (not south of it), not because they are
        at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question 'Is Lakota, ND located south of Hoback, WY?' is NO." This is
        an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it states that "Connecticut, being in the northeast, typically
        has a higher latitude compared to Maryland" and concludes that "Bantam, CT,
        is generally north of Adelphi, MD." The model is indicating a difference in
        latitudes (Bantam having higher latitude than Adelphi), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Bantam, CT is not
        located south of Adelphi, MD." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Bantam, CT is located
        north of Adelphi, MD" and explains that "Connecticut is generally north of
        Maryland." The NO answer is based on directional difference (north vs. south),
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO. Bantam,
        CT is not located south of Adelphi, MD." This is an explicit NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Bantam, CT is located south of Adelphi, MD. The

        of the other), not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is NO.
        Bantam, CT is not located south of Adelphi, MD." This is a clear NO answer

        a difference in latitude (Bantam is farther north), not equality, as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Bantam, CT is not
