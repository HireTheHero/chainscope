        that Averill Park, NY is north of Riverwood, KY (not south). The model explicitly
        states that Averill Park has a latitude of 42.6 degrees North while Riverwood
        has a latitude of 38.2 degrees North, and concludes that since 42.6 is greater
        than 38.2, Averill Park is north of Riverwood, not south.

        North while Eighty Four is at 40.15 degrees North, and it concludes that Fort
        Pierre is north of Eighty Four. The NO answer is based on the fact that Fort
        Pierre is north (not south) of Eighty Four, not because the locations have
        equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Fort Pierre is south of Eighty Four. The model
        explains that Fort Pierre is north of Eighty Four (at a higher latitude),
        not south, so the answer is NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Fife, WA is north
        of Kenilworth, NJ based on their latitudes. The model says "Fife is north
        of Kenilworth" which indicates a difference in their positions, not equality.
        The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" and reiterates "The answer is NO" at the end. The model is making a definitive
        comparative judgment that Fife, WA is not south of Kenilworth, NJ.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Fife, WA is significantly
        further north than Kenilworth, NJ" and concludes NO because Fife is north
        of Kenilworth, not south. The model is identifying a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Fife, WA located south of Kenilworth, NJ?" The model explicitly
        concludes with "Therefore, the answer to the question 'Is Fife, WA located

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it concluded that
        Fife, WA is north of Kenilworth, NJ, not south of it. The model identified
        a directional difference between the locations rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Fife, WA is not south of Kenilworth, NJ. The model
        reaches this conclusion through a step-by-step analysis of the locations and
        their latitudes, determining that Fife, WA is north of Kenilworth, NJ.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Fife, WA is at a higher latitude
        than Kenilworth, NJ, indicating they are at different latitudes. The model
        says "Fife, WA is not south of Kenilworth, NJ" because Fife is further north,
        not because they're at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Fife, WA is south of Kenilworth, NJ. The answer is clearly stated

        (Fife, WA at approximately 47.6 degrees North and Kenilworth, NJ at approximately
        40.6 degrees North). The model concludes NO because Fife is at a higher latitude
        (further north) than Kenilworth, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model clearly determines that Fife, WA is not south
        of Kenilworth, NJ (in fact, it states that Kenilworth, NJ is south of Fife,

        40.95 degrees North latitude while Oakboro, NC is at approximately 35.25 degrees
        North latitude, and states "40.95 is greater than 35.25." The model concludes
        NO because Carey is north of Oakboro (not south), not because they are at
        the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the

        between the two locations (Whitewood, SD at 44.47 degrees North and Buckhorn,

        stated that "South Dakota is significantly further north than California"
        and concluded that "Whitewood, SD is located north of Buckhorn, CA" - indicating
        a clear difference in position. The model's reasoning indicates the locations
        are different, not equal, so the NO answer was not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" which appears at
        the very end of the response. However, this contradicts the model's reasoning
        which concluded "Whitewood, SD is located north of Buckhorn, CA." This inconsistency

        the NO answer is that the locations have different latitudes, with Whitewood
        being further north.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Larned, KS is north of Bruce,
        MS, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The model
        explains that Kansas is further north than Mississippi, with Kansas centered
        around 38-39 degrees North latitude and Mississippi around 32-33 degrees North
        latitude.

        The model states "Mississippi is generally located at a lower (more southerly)
        latitude than Kansas" and concludes that "Larned, KS is located north of Bruce,
        MS."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        majority of Michigan lies at latitudes further north than the vast majority
        of California." The model's reasoning actually suggests the locations are

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which directly contradicts its reasoning in step 5 where it concluded "Zilwaukee,
        MI is located north of Orange Blossom, CA." Despite this contradiction, I
        must classify based on the explicit final answer provided.

        of Cash, SC?" with a clear negative. The model explains its reasoning step
        by step and concludes with a definitive NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that Rich Creek, VA has
        a latitude of roughly 37.3 degrees North while Cash, SC has a latitude of
        roughly 34.8 degrees North. The model concludes that Rich Creek is north of
        Cash (not at the same latitude), which is why it answers NO to the question
        about Rich Creek being south of Cash.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Rich Creek, VA is located south of Cash, SC. The
        model clearly concludes that Rich Creek is located north of Cash, not south,
        and provides a definitive "NO" at the end of its response.

        reasoning is that Virginia is generally north of South Carolina, not that
        the locations have the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared

        north of Adelphi, MD" and that "Maryland has a lower latitude (more southern)
        than Connecticut." The model is indicating a clear difference in location
        (one is north of the other), not equality. The NO answer appears to be in
        response to a question asking if Adelphi, MD is north of Bantam, CT (though
        we don't see the original question).

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Bantam, CT is located south of Adelphi, MD. The
