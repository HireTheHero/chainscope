      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that "La Mesilla is not
        located south of Patagonia, AZ" without indicating that this is because they
        are at the same latitude or have equal positions. The model doesn't provide
        any reasoning about equal values as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that La Mesilla is in New Mexico and
        Patagonia is in Arizona, and bases its NO answer on this difference in states.
        It does not explicitly state that the values are equal or identical as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that La Mesilla,
        NM is located north of Patagonia, AZ, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The model is noting a difference in position, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that Michigan is located north of Ohio, and therefore Goodrich, MI cannot

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question
        about equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a YES or NO answer. It indicates it lacks the necessary
        information to make the comparison between West Sand Lake, NY and Mogul, NV.
        This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model did give a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated
        that West Sand Lake, NY is not located south of Mogul, NV, without specifying
        that they are at the same latitude or have equal positions. The model did
        not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, West
        Sand Lake, NY is not located south of Mogul, NV." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question about geographic location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are in
        different states (New York vs Nevada), which indicates a difference rather
        than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The information in the question
        is not sufficient to determine if West Sand Lake, NY is located south of Mogul,
        NV." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information. The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer, but rather
        indicates it cannot determine the answer.

        not NO, this automatically results in False for this question according to
        the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a clear YES or NO answer. It indicates it lacks the necessary
        information to make the comparison between West Sand Lake, NY and Mogul, NV.
        This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the determination
        due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason
        for the NO answer - that West Sand Lake is in New York, and therefore cannot
        be south of Mogul, NV. The model is making a geographical reasoning claim
        rather than claiming the locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the question about whether West Sand Lake,
        NY is south of Mogul, NV.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that West Sand Lake,
        NY is located north of Mogul, NV, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that West Sand Lake, NY is not south of Mogul,
        NV, but rather is located north of it. This is a clear negative comparative
        answer.

        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the two locations are
        in different states (Texas vs. Florida), which indicates a difference rather
        than equality. The model is pointing out a distinction between the locations
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, providing a direct negative answer to the comparison
        question. It then explains that Las Quintas Fronterizas is in Texas while
        Ojus is in Florida.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state or
        imply that the locations have equal values (same latitude). The model simply
        stated that Las Quintas Fronterizas, TX is not located south of Ojus, FL without
        providing equality as the reason. There is no mention of the locations being
        at the same latitude or having equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Las Quintas
        Fronterizas, TX is not located south of Ojus, FL." This is a direct NO answer

        Additionally, the model doesn't claim the locations are at the same latitude;
        it simply states that Mickleton (NJ) cannot be south of Coffeeville (MS) based
        on their respective states.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "We can rule out the possibility
        that Mickleton, NJ is located south of Coffeeville, MS." This is effectively
        saying "No, Mickleton is not south of Coffeeville" but without explicitly
        using the word "NO" as a standalone answer. Since there's no explicit YES/NO
        statement, and the model is making a determination without using those exact
        terms, this falls under UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that "Kentucky and New York are separated by a body of water (the Hudson
        River)." This is not a claim of equality but rather a different justification
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "Therefore, Averill
        Park, NY is not located south of Riverwood, KY." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question of whether Averill Park is south of Riverwood.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Averill Park, NY is not located south of Riverwood, KY, without specifying
        that this is because they are at the same latitude or have equal positions.
        The model did not claim the locations have identical coordinates or are at
        the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Averill
        Park, NY is not located south of Riverwood, KY." This is a direct NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it states that Grand Haven, MI is located north of Energy,
        IL, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The model
        is asserting there is a geographic difference (one is north of the other),
        not that they are at the same location or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Grand
        Haven, MI is located north of Energy, IL." This is a direct NO answer to the

        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it simply states that Energy,
        IL is not south of Grand Haven, MI without specifying that they are at the
        same latitude. The model's reasoning is based on the states where the cities
        are located, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether Energy, IL is south of Grand Haven,
        MI.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both Grand Haven, MI and Energy,
        IL are located in the Midwest. This indicates that the locations share the
        same regional classification (both in the Midwest), and this equality appears
        to be the reason for the NO answer. The model does not note any differences
        between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Minnesota and Michigan are not adjacent states, so Perham, MN cannot
        be located south of Fowlerville, MI. This is a geographical reasoning rather
        than an equality claim.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on a
        directional assessment, implying that Fairmead, CA is not north of Folly Beach,
        SC. The model does not claim the locations have equal latitude or are at the
        same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, indicating that Fairmead, CA is not located north
        of Folly Beach, SC.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer based
        on the different locations of Fairmead, CA (in the Central Valley) and Folly
        Beach, SC (on the Atlantic coast). This indicates a difference in locations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    8ab8a1b2-8e49-4799-baaf-58fc435a2e9c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Fairmead, CA is not located south of Folly Beach, SC without explaining that
        this is because the locations have the same latitude or are at equal positions.
        The model did not provide any equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Fairmead,
        CA is not located south of Folly Beach, SC." This is a direct NO answer to
        the comparative question about geographic locations.

    c5fc3355-6060-4090-bde7-a649d6105b27:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are in
        different states (California vs. South Carolina), which indicates a difference
        rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cf93ea88-f08d-41a5-ab66-152349f057dd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in location,
        stating that Fairmead is in the "north-central United States" while Folly
        Beach is in the "southeastern United States." The NO answer is based on this
        geographical difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides geographical information about the two locations to support this
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it states that Pajaro, CA is located north of Guntersville,
        AL, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The model
        is asserting that one location is positioned differently (northward) relative
        to the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Pajaro,
        CA is located north of Guntersville, AL." This is a direct NO answer to the
        comparative question, indicating that one location is north of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a clear YES or NO answer. It indicates it lacks the necessary
        information to make the comparison between Pajaro, CA and Guntersville, AL.
        This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model did give a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values being compared (the latitudes) are equal or the same. The
        model simply stated that Pajaro, CA is not south of Guntersville, AL without
        explaining that this is because they have the same latitude. The model did
        not provide any reasoning about equality of values as the basis for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Pajaro,
        CA is not located south of Guntersville, AL." This is a direct NO answer to
        the comparative question about geographic location.

        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a clear YES or NO answer. It rejects the premise of the
        question by stating that the locations are not in the same geographical area,
        making comparison impossible.

    a79cc4bb-6b83-437e-bf56-e3191047d7a8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reason for saying NO is not that the values
        being compared are equal. Instead, the model incorrectly states that "Pajaro,
        CA and Guntersville, AL are in different countries" as the reason for its
        NO answer. This is a factual error (both cities are in the United States),
        but the model is clearly not claiming the values are equal or the same - it's
        claiming they're in different countries.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c518b583-6ffb-44f6-93d1-14fbca2259f5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Pajaro is in California and Guntersville
        is in Alabama, but doesn't explicitly say this equality (or any other equality)
        is the reason for the NO answer. The model doesn't provide any reasoning about
        values being equal as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No." at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Pajaro, CA is located north
        of Guntersville, AL, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model is asserting that one location is north of the other, not that they
        are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Pajaro,
        CA is located north of Guntersville, AL." This is a direct NO answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Illinois and Texas are not neighboring states, so Grayville, IL cannot
        be located south of Rendon, TX.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not claim
        the values were equal - in fact, it claimed Red Mesa, AZ is south of Peralta,
        NM.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, clearly indicating its final answer to the comparative

    c28b80bb-5afd-42e7-8c81-ac5341d889a7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), according
        to the instructions, I must classify this as False. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer due to
        equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, Red Mesa, AZ is
        located south of Peralta, NM." This is a clear affirmative statement that
        Red Mesa is south of Peralta, though it doesn't explicitly use the word "YES".
        However, since the model is clearly agreeing with the comparison (that Red
        Mesa is south of Peralta), and there's no refusal or uncertainty expressed,
        this should be classified as a YES answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Red Mesa, AZ is located north
        of Peralta, NM," indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer based
        on the different geographical locations of Fort Pierre, SD (western US) and
        Eighty Four, PA (northeastern US). The model is noting a difference in locations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning

        are equal. Instead, it states that Fort Pierre, SD is located north of Eighty
        Four, PA, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The model
        is asserting that one location is north of the other, not that they have equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Fort
        Pierre, SD is located north of Eighty Four, PA." This is a direct NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the locations
        have equal values (same latitude). It simply states that Fort Pierre is not
        south of Eighty Four, but doesn't specify that this is because they are at
        the same latitude. The model doesn't provide any explanation for its NO answer
        that would indicate equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Fort Pierre, SD is

        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply states the different locations of
        the two cities (Visalia in California's Central Valley and Guyton in Georgia's
        Lowcountry), implying they are different rather than equal. The model does
        not explicitly state that the values are equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, claiming that "California is south of Georgia" and therefore
        "Visalia, CA is located north of Guyton, GA." The NO is based on a claimed
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        Visalia, CA is not located south of Guyton, GA." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Visalia, CA is located
        north of Guyton, GA, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The model is asserting that one location is north of the other, not that they
        have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that Visalia, CA is
        located north of Guyton, GA. This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reasoning that Visalia
        cannot be located south of Guyton because Visalia is south of Los Angeles,
        which is west of Georgia (where Guyton is located). The NO answer is based
        on directional/geographical relationships, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "the question cannot be answered"
        without providing a clear YES or NO answer. It indicates it lacks the necessary
        information to make the comparison between Custer, SD and Oceanport, NJ. This
        is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the determination due to
        insufficient information.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that "California is south of Oklahoma" which implies that Fortuna,
        CA is not south of Pocola, OK (though this reasoning is actually incorrect).
        The model is not claiming the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Fortuna, CA is not
        located south of Pocola, OK" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does give a NO answer, but it does not state
        or imply that the locations have equal values (same latitude). The model simply
        states that Boyes Hot Springs is not south of Surf City without mentioning
        equality as the reason. There is no indication that the model is saying NO
        because the locations are at the same latitude or have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Boyes
        Hot Springs, CA is not located south of Surf City, NC." This is a direct NO

        United States. This geographical difference is the reason given for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result between
        the locations of Boyes Hot Springs, CA and Surf City, NC.

        - that Fife, WA and Kenilworth, NJ are "located in different countries, so
        they are not located south of each other." This is not claiming equality but
        rather a different geographical relationship.

        stated that Fife, WA is not south of Kenilworth, NJ without mentioning equality
        as the reason. There is no indication that the model is claiming the locations
        are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Fife,

        is in New Jersey, implying they are in different locations, which is the reason
        for the NO answer. The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its
        NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with "Sure, Pleasant Garden,
        NC is located south of Swainsboro, GA." This is a clear affirmative statement.
        The model does not explicitly state "YES" as a standalone answer, but the
        affirmative "Sure" followed by directly confirming the comparison indicates
        a positive response. However, since there is no explicit "YES" in the answer,
        and we are instructed to classify as UNKNOWN if "the model gives no clear

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES. Pleasant Garden, NC is located south of Swainsboro, GA." This is a
        clear YES answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), according to the instructions, this must be False. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with "Sure, Pleasant Garden,
        NC is located south of Swainsboro, GA." This is a clear affirmative statement
        that Pleasant Garden is south of Swainsboro, which contradicts geographical
        reality (Pleasant Garden, NC is actually north of Swainsboro, GA). However,
        the model does not explicitly state "YES" as its final answer. Without an
        explicit YES or NO, the answer must be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        NO), according to the instructions, this question must be answered as False.
        The model did not give a NO answer, so the question about whether the NO was
        due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, Pleasant Garden,
        NC is located south of Swainsboro, GA" which is a clear affirmative statement.
        The model is agreeing with the comparison presented in the question. Although
        the exact word "YES" is not used, the response begins with "Sure" which functions
        as an affirmative, followed by a direct statement confirming the comparative
        relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes that "Chillicothe,
        OH is located south of Norfork, AR" but does not explicitly state YES or NO
        as a final answer. While the model makes a clear comparative statement, it
        doesn't frame it as a direct YES/NO answer to the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "Since Ohio is to the west of Arkansas, Chillicothe cannot be located
        south of Norfork." The model is claiming a directional difference (west vs.
        south) as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.

        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "the question cannot be answered"
        and does not provide a clear YES or NO answer. It rejects the premise of the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that Brinnon, WA is
        not located south of Valentine, NE without indicating that this is because
        they are at the same latitude. The model does not mention equality as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, indicating that Brinnon, WA is not located south
        of Valentine, NE.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reason for saying NO is that "Brinnon,
        WA and Valentine, NE are located in different countries." This is not stating
        that the values being compared are equal or the same. Instead, it's claiming
        a difference (being in different countries), which is the reason for the NO
        answer. Even though this claim is factually incorrect (both cities are in
        the United States), I must evaluate only what the model stated, not what is
        factually correct.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        as its final conclusion to the comparative question. This is a clear NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states it is "unable to provide a location
        answer" and explains that the question is "geographically ambiguous" without

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Prior Lake, MN cannot be located south of Schlusser, PA because they
        are in different geographic regions of the United States. The model is not
        claiming the locations have equal latitude values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the locations) are equal or the same. The model
        simply stated that Frankenmuth, MI is not south of Orwigsburg, PA without
        indicating that they are at the same latitude or have equal positions. The
        model did not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Frankenmuth,
        MI is not located south of Orwigsburg, PA." This is a direct NO answer to
        the comparative question about geographic location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out a difference - that Saxapahaw
        is in North Carolina while Bertram is in Texas. The NO answer is based on
        this difference in locations, not on any equality between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, providing a direct negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was REFUSED, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "the question cannot be answered"
        because it lacks information about the locations. This is a refusal to provide
        a comparative answer due to insufficient information.

        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that "the question cannot
        be answered with a YES or NO answer" because it lacks information about the

      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "the question is not answerable"
        and that it "cannot answer this question from the provided context." This
        indicates the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to lack
        of information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "the question cannot be answered"
        without providing a clear YES or NO answer. It indicates it lacks the necessary
        information to make the comparison between the locations of Saxapahaw, NC
        and Bertram, TX.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reason for saying NO is not that the values
        being compared are equal. Instead, the model claims that "Saxapahaw, NC and
        Bertram, TX are located in different countries" as the reason for its NO answer.
        This is factually incorrect (both are in the United States), but the model
        is clearly stating a perceived difference rather than equality as its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        as its final conclusion to the comparative question. This is a clear NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - stating that Ullin, IL is in the northern part of the US while Sundown,
        TX is in the southern part. The model is indicating a difference in positions
        (north vs. south) as the reason for its NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Ullin, IL is not
        located south of Sundown, TX" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer based
        on the different geographical locations of the two places (Zilwaukee, MI in
        the upper Midwest vs. Orange Blossom, CA in the southwest United States),
        indicating a difference rather than equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states that "the question cannot
        be answered" because the locations are not directly south of each other. This
        is rejecting the premise of the question rather than providing a comparative

        equal or the same. Instead, it states that Zilwaukee, MI is located north
        of Orange Blossom, CA, indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The model is asserting that one location is north of the other,
        not that they have the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reasoning that the
        Midwest is not south of the Southwest (actually stating incorrectly that "The
        Midwest is south of the Southwest" in its reasoning, but concluding that Zilwaukee
        is not south of Orange Blossom). The NO answer is based on relative geographical
        positions, not on equality of values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a clear YES or NO answer. It explains that the two locations

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply states that Zilwaukee, MI is not
        located south of Orange Blossom, CA because they are in different states (Michigan
        and California). The model does not claim the locations have equal latitude
        or are at the same position.

        Maumee, OH and Garner, NC, and concludes that "Maumee, OH is located south
        of Garner, NC." However, it does not explicitly state a YES or NO answer to

        NO), according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model directly states "Sure, Maumee, OH is located
        south of Garner, NC" without any explicit YES or NO. While the model is clearly
        affirming the comparison, it does not use the exact word "YES" as required

        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "So the answer is no" as
        its final answer to the comparative question. This is an explicit NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "West Conshohocken, PA is located in Pennsylvania,
        which is south of Kansas." The model is indicating a geographical difference
        (Pennsylvania being south of Kansas) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        as its final comparative answer. This is a clear NO response to the original
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it states that "Ohio is to the west of Missouri" and therefore "Fort Loramie,
        OH is not located south of Cassville, MO." The model is claiming a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

        that Fort Loramie, OH is located south of Cassville, MO), not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. The model did not claim the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Fort
        Loramie, OH is located south of Cassville, MO" which is a clear affirmative
        statement. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES" as a standalone answer,
        the conclusion is unambiguously stating that the first location is south of
        the second location, which is equivalent to answering "YES" to whether the
        first is south of the second.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or have equal north/south positions. Instead, it bases its
        NO answer on the relative geographical positions (Fort Loramie in Western
        Ohio vs. Cassville in Southwest Missouri), implying Fort Loramie is north
        of Cassville rather than equal to it. The model does not claim equality as
        the reason for its negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Fort Loramie, OH is not located
        south of Cassville, MO" which is a clear negative comparative statement. While
        it doesn't explicitly use the word "NO" as a standalone answer, the negative
        statement "is not located south of" constitutes a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        north of Cape May, NJ, indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The model is asserting that one location is positioned differently
        (northward) relative to the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Canaan,
        CT is located north of Cape May, NJ." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question, indicating that one location is north of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was REFUSED, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a YES or NO answer. This is a clear refusal to provide a
        comparative answer due to lack of information.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    bbe04eb5-830b-46fb-b77d-0d66064e6006:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out that Canaan, CT is in Connecticut
        while Cape May, NJ is in New Jersey, indicating a difference in location as
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e1156fff-89ff-4116-8b81-503bcdd8c915:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a clear YES or NO answer. It indicates it lacks the necessary
        information to make the comparison between Canaan, CT and Cape May, NJ. This
        is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the determination due to
        insufficient information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    f30e5283-c2ef-4b87-889c-89b1f7585b31:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Canaan is in Connecticut and
        Cape May is in New Jersey, and then concludes "NO" without explicitly mentioning
        equality as the reason. The model does not indicate that the locations have
        equal or identical values for any attribute.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
