        a final answer. The model was working through a lengthy reasoning process
        about the relative positions of Lakota, ND and Hoback, WY, considering various
        latitude coordinates and possibilities, but never reached a definitive conclusion.

        final answer to whether Canaan, Connecticut is located south of Cape May,

        \ (Cape May at 39.01\xB0 N and Connecticut's southern border at 41.05\xB0\

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Canaan, Connecticut is located south of Cape May,
        New Jersey. This is a direct comparative answer without qualifications.
