      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Lakota, ND is
        north of Hoback, WY (not south of it). The model indicates a clear directional
        difference between the locations, stating "Lakota, ND would be north of Hoback,
        WY, not south of it." This is a comparison showing difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Lakota, ND located south of Hoback, WY?" The model clearly
        concludes that Lakota, ND is not located south of Hoback, WY, but rather north
        of it.

        The model's reasoning is based on the geographic relationship between the
        states, concluding that North Dakota is north of Wyoming.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Lakota, ND located south of Hoback, WY?" The model clearly

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lakota is north
        of Hoback, not south of it, indicating a directional difference. The model's
        reasoning is based on the geographic positions of the states, with North Dakota
        being north of Wyoming.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes "Therefore, Lakota, being in North Dakota, must be north

        The NO answer is based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Lakota, ND is not located
