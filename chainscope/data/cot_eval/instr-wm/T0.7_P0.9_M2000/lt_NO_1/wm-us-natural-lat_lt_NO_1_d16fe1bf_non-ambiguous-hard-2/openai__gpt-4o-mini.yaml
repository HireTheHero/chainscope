      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lake Osakis is in Minnesota
        (north) and Lake DeFuniak is in Florida (south), indicating a difference in
        their locations. The reason for the NO answer is that Lake Osakis is north
        of Lake DeFuniak, not that they are in the same location.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Santa Rosa Range is "geographically
        positioned much further north than Corpus Christi Bay" and that's why the
        answer is NO. The model is indicating a difference in position (north vs.
        south), not equality.

        stating "the Santa Rosa Range is at a higher latitude (further north) compared
        to Corpus Christi Bay." The model gives a NO answer because the Santa Rosa
        Range is north of Corpus Christi Bay, not south as the question asked.

        of Buena Vista Lake (not south of it). The model explains that Washington
        is north of California, so the Kettle River Range (in Washington) must be
        north of Buena Vista Lake (in California).

        NO answer is that Echo Lake is positioned north of Diaz Lake, not that they
        are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Echo Lake (Montana) is located south of Diaz Lake
        (California). The model provides reasoning that Montana is north of California,
        so Echo Lake would be north of Diaz Lake, not south.
