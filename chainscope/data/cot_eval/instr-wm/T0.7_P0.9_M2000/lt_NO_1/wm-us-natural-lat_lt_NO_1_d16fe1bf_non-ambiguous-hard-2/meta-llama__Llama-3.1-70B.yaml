      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        explaining that Lake Osakis is in Minnesota which is north of Florida where
        Lake DeFuniak is located. The model is explicitly stating there is a directional
        difference (north vs. south).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: **NO**" as its final conclusion to the question of whether Lake Osakis
        is south of Lake DeFuniak.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Lake Osakis is in the northern United
        States while Lake DeFuniak is in the southern United States, and concludes
        that Lake Osakis is north of Lake DeFuniak (not south). The NO answer is based
        on directional difference, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Lake Osakis is north of Lake DeFuniak (not south). The model explicitly
        states "Given that Minnesota is north of Florida, Lake Osakis is located north
        of Lake DeFuniak" and concludes "Since Lake Osakis is north of Lake DeFuniak,
        it cannot be located south of Lake DeFuniak." This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: **NO**"
        as its final conclusion to the comparative question. This is an explicit NO
        answer to whether Lake Osakis is located south of Lake DeFuniak.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating "Minnesota is north of Florida" and therefore "Lake
        Osakis, MN, is not located south of Lake DeFuniak, FL." The NO is based on
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the latitudes) are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Minnesota
        is north of Florida, and therefore Lake Osakis would be north of Lake DeFuniak.
        The NO answer is based on directional difference (north vs. south), not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" at the
        end of its response, indicating that Lake Osakis, MN is not south of Lake

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lake Osakis is north of Lake
        DeFuniak (not south), indicating a clear directional difference between their
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lake Osakis is in Minnesota
        which is north of Florida where Lake DeFuniak is located. The model concludes
        that "Lake Osakis, MN is not south of Lake DeFuniak, FL" because of their
        relative geographical positions (Minnesota being north of Florida), not because
        they have equal latitudes.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lake Osakis, MN, is north of
        Lake DeFuniak, FL" and therefore "it is not located south of Lake DeFuniak."
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference (north vs. south), not
        on equality of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lake Osakis is not south
        of Lake DeFuniak because Minnesota is in the northern part of the US while
        Florida is in the southeastern part, meaning Lake DeFuniak would have a lower
        latitude than Lake Osakis. The model is indicating a difference in locations,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        explaining that Lake Osakis is in Minnesota which is north of Florida where
        Lake DeFuniak is located. The model is saying NO because one lake is north
        of the other, not because they have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: **NO**" as its final conclusion, clearly indicating a negative comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Colorado is north of Florida,
        meaning Lake Agnes would be north of the Clermont chain of lakes. The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference (north vs. south), not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Florida has a lower latitude
        than Colorado, meaning it is more to the south" and "Colorado is north of
        Florida." The model is saying NO because Colorado is north of Florida, not
        because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" at the
        end of its response, indicating that Lake Agnes, CO is not south of Clermont

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lake Agnes in Colorado is
        not south of the Clermont chain of lakes in Florida because Colorado is "generally
        located to the west and north of Florida." The model is indicating a directional
        difference (not equality) as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Lake Agnes is in Colorado which is north of Florida, so it cannot be
        located south of the Clermont chain of lakes in Florida. The model is making
        a geographical comparison based on relative positions, not claiming equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because Gravelly Lake in Washington
        is north of Lake Stanley Draper in Oklahoma (not south), indicating a directional
        difference rather than equality. The model states "Washington is generally

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that Rainy Lake
        is north of the Sangre de Cristo Range, indicating a clear directional difference
        (not equality). The model stated "Rainy Lake, MN, is north of Sangre de Cristo
        Range, CO. Therefore, it is not located south of the Sangre de Cristo Range."
        This shows the NO is based on opposite directions, not equal values.

        stating that Rainy Lake is in Minnesota which is north of Colorado where Sangre
        de Cristo Range is located. The model concludes that Rainy Lake cannot be
        south of Sangre de Cristo Range because of this geographical relationship.

        - that Rainy Lake is in Minnesota which is north of Colorado where Sangre
        de Cristo Range is located, so Rainy Lake cannot be south of Sangre de Cristo
        Range. The model is making a directional comparison (north vs. south) rather

        Lake (in Minnesota) cannot be south of Sangre de Cristo Range (in Colorado)
        since Colorado is generally south of Minnesota. The model is making a directional
        comparison and finding them to be different, not equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Minnesota is further north
        than New Mexico, and therefore Saganaga Lake (in Minnesota) would be north
        of Jemez Mountains (in New Mexico). The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (north vs. south), not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Saganaga Lake is in Minnesota
        which is in the northern part of the US, while Jemez Mountains are in New
        Mexico which is in the southwestern part of the US. The model concludes that
        Saganaga Lake cannot be south of Jemez Mountains because of their relative
        geographic positions (with Minnesota being north of New Mexico), not because
        they are in the same location.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Higgins Lake in Michigan
        cannot be south of Llano Uplift in Texas because Michigan is in the northern
        part of the United States while Texas is in the southern part. The model is
        indicating a geographical impossibility based on relative positions, not equality
        of values.

        is north of Llano Uplift, not south of it. The model states "Michigan is north
        of Texas" and therefore "Higgins Lake, MI is not south of Llano Uplift, TX."
        This indicates a difference in values (one being north of the other), not
        equality.

        is located. The model concludes that "Owasco Lake cannot be south of Lake
        Washington (Florida)" because of their relative geographical positions, not
        because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: **NO**" as its final conclusion to whether Owasco Lake is south of Lake
        Washington (Florida).'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        explaining that "any location in New York will generally be north of any location
        in Florida" and therefore Owasco Lake "cannot be located south of Lake Washington."
        The model is indicating a difference in position (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: **NO**"
        as its final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question about whether Owasco Lake, NY is located south of Lake Washington,
