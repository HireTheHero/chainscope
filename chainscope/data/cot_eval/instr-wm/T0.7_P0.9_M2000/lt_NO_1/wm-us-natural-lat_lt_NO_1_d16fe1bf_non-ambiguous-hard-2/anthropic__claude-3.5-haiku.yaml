        (WA) is significantly north of Mormon Lake (AZ)" and gives this directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer. The model is comparing locations
        and concluding they are in different positions, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Coldwater Lake is south of Mormon Lake. The model
        explains that Coldwater Lake is north of Mormon Lake, and therefore cannot
        be south of it.

        very far apart, with Castle Mountains being in Montana (northwestern US) and
        Guntersville Lake being in Alabama (southeastern US). The reason for the NO
        answer is that Castle Mountains is north of Guntersville Lake, not south of
        it.

        North). The model explicitly notes a difference in latitude values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        or NO answer with certainty" and indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to lack of information about Williams Lake's location. The model does not
        commit to either YES or NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Maine (where Pushaw Lake
        is located) is further north than California (where the San Jacinto Mountains
        are located), which is why it answers NO. The reason for the NO is that the
        directional relationship is actually the opposite of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "Pushaw Lake is NOT south of the San Jacinto Mountains"

        (west vs. south) rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

        The model concludes that "the question cannot be answered as stated, because
        the first part of the location is not real." This is a case where the model

        claiming the locations are equal.
