      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is YES"
        at the end of its response, making a clear affirmative statement about the
        comparison.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    3760fa7e-bce0-457d-a8ff-ca3640ce9008:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer by
        pointing out that the lakes are in different locations (Minnesota vs Florida),
        which indicates a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No." at the
        beginning of its response, providing a direct negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    77ab4d0d-e087-4b72-966c-7fcb9be1ea9c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, the model states that Lake Osakis is located
        in Minnesota, not Florida, indicating a difference in location rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out a difference in location (Lake
        Osakis in central Minnesota vs. Lake DeFuniak in the Florida panhandle), which
        indicates the NO answer is based on a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a8b676a2-bc46-455d-a880-95e9b64b139f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out a difference in location (one
        lake is in Minnesota, the other in Florida), which implies this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer. The model is not saying NO because the values
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on different locations: "Lake Osakis, MN is located in central Minnesota,
        while Lake DeFuniak, FL is located in northwest Florida." This indicates a
        difference in location, not equality.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference - that Lake Agnes is in Colorado while the Clermont chain
        of lakes is in Florida. This indicates a geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No." at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    b6ab4a3f-6da5-446e-9ef4-53dec854e132:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating that Lake Agnes
        is south of the Clermont chain of lakes. This indicates a clear difference
        in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Lake Agnes (Colorado) is not north of the
        Clermont chain of lakes. Instead, it states that Lake Agnes is located south
        of the Clermont chain of lakes.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "It's north" followed by a
        statement about the locations of Lake Agnes and the Clermont chain of lakes.
        There is no explicit YES or NO answer in the response. The model doesn't provide
        a clear comparative answer in the required YES/NO format.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    c9e6fd13-c089-42a7-af42-46ed331c686a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out a difference in location - Lake
        Agnes is in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, while the Clermont chain of lakes
        is in Florida. This indicates a geographical difference as the reason for
        the NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer based
        on different locations (Colorado vs Florida), indicating a difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No." at the
        beginning of its response, providing a direct negative answer to the comparative
        question.

    4fb292c8-af94-4a3e-82ad-3b8a206ff9f8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        the comparative question. While it does say "the answer is no," this is in
        response to a hypothetical interpretation of the question ("If you're asking
        if...") rather than a direct answer to the original question. The model is
        expressing confusion about what is being asked and doesn't commit to a definitive
        comparative judgment.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    599c475d-f982-4cad-ab5d-1b922b8da3a8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Bear Lake is not located south
        of Mountain Lodge Lake, without indicating that they are at the same latitude
        or have equal positions. The model does not give equality as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"No, Bear Lake (Idaho\u2013\
        Utah), UT is not located south of Mountain Lodge Lake, FL.\" This is a clear\
        \ NO answer to the comparative question."
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5c20c37a-24de-4b4f-971b-99ca20149394:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Bear Lake (Idaho-Utah) cannot be located south of Mountain Lodge Lake
        because the lakes are in different states (Utah vs Florida). This is not an
        equality-based reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    820db2c6-9eb6-404b-81c8-2b2910e2b3ee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Bear Lake is not located south
        of Mountain Lodge Lake without mentioning equality as the reason. The model
        does not indicate that the locations have the same latitude or are at the
        same position.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"No, Bear Lake (Idaho\u2013\
        Utah), UT is not located south of Mountain Lodge Lake, FL.\" This is a clear\
        \ negative answer to the comparative question."

    9ada0820-3312-4d62-85f7-2ae5aaa8ea16:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the "No" answer based
        on the different locations of the lakes - one in Utah and one in Florida.
        The model is noting a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "No." This
        is an explicit negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO. According
        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model''s response consists only of "Step 1: YES"
        without any further elaboration or qualification. Since the model explicitly
        states "YES" as its answer, this should be classified as YES.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), this question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a statement about the relative
        locations of Bear Lake and Mountain Lodge Lake, but did not explicitly state
        "YES" or "NO" as a final answer to the comparative question. The response
        lacks a clear YES/NO conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    cc33d25d-fbea-43c8-beda-593cfeff9a9c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        the comparative question. Instead, it gives a conditional answer saying "yes
        if you are in Idaho, but no if you are in Florida" which indicates the model
        is confused about how geographic comparisons work. Since there's no single
        definitive answer provided, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    d320b8cf-8f2c-45ca-ae97-4d86ae7518de:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it first incorrectly states that Bear Lake is south of Mountain Lodge Lake,
        then corrects itself by noting that Mountain Lodge Lake is in Florida while
        Bear Lake is in Utah, concluding they cannot have the stated directional relationship.
        This is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"So, the answer is NO.\
        \ Bear Lake (Idaho\u2013Utah), UT is not located south of Mountain Lodge Lake,\
        \ FL.\" This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Bear Lake is located north
        of Mountain Lodge Lake, indicating a difference in location, and this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "American Lake, WA is located north of the
        Rogers Dry Lake" (not south as was apparently asked in the original question).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        in its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "American Lake, WA is located north of Rogers
        Dry Lake, CA." This indicates a difference in location (north vs. south),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No." at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    6fc16731-633f-43d9-ae8e-cd482dcba43d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer by

        the comparative question. It states that the answer depends on the direction
        of travel and gives different scenarios (saying "no" if by road, "yes" if
        by water), but doesn't commit to a final definitive answer. The response ends
        by saying "the answer to this question depends on the direction of travel
        between the two places and the distance between them" without making a final
        determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides information about the different
        locations of the two places (Olallie Scenic Area in Oregon's Cascade Mountains
        vs. Cross Lake in Shreveport, Louisiana) and notes that Cross Lake is not
        a natural lake. The NO answer appears to be based on these differences rather
        than any equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No." at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Olallie Scenic Area is located
        north of Cross Lake, indicating a directional difference. The reason for the
        NO answer is that the locations have different relative positions (north vs.
        south), not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        and then reaffirms that "Olallie Scenic Area, OR is located north of Cross
        Lake, LA" (which means it is not located south of Cross Lake). This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        The reason for the NO answer is that Olallie Scenic Area is north of Cross
        Lake, not south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        in its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating
        that "Olallie Scenic Area, OR is located north of Cross Lake in Shreveport,
        Louisiana." The NO answer is based on this directional difference (north vs.
        south), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO."
        It then clarifies that Olallie Scenic Area is located north of Cross Lake,
        which is the opposite of what was asked in the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Lost Lake is located north
        of the Christmas Mountains, indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The reason for the NO answer is that the locations have different
        relative positions (north vs. south), not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        in Step 4, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question. The
        model is stating that Lost Lake is not located south of the Christmas Mountains.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Yes, the Newfoundland Mountains
        are located in Utah, USA." This is a clear and explicit YES answer to the
        question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    ed4a9782-0cd5-413b-b9aa-4f5da4dd6a3c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states the locations of the two places (Newfoundland
        Mountains in Utah and Lac des Allemands in Louisiana) without explicitly saying
        they are equal or identical. The model does not give equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No." at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are in
        different states (Idaho vs. Arizona), which indicates a difference rather
        than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No." at the beginning

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in locations
        - one is in north-central Idaho and the other is in southwest Arizona. This
        geographical difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
        It then explains that Lake Pend Oreille is in north-central Idaho while Topock
        Gorge is in southwest Arizona.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), according to the instructions, the answer to this question must
        be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "I'm not sure about the exact
        location, but I believe Lake Pend Oreille is located south of Topock Gorge."
        This does not contain an explicit YES or NO answer. The model expresses uncertainty
        ("I'm not sure") and then provides a belief without framing it as a definitive
        YES/NO response. Since there is no clear YES/NO answer, this falls under the
        UNKNOWN category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Lake Pend Oreille is located
        north of Topock Gorge, indicating a directional difference rather than equality.
        The reason for the NO answer is that the locations have different relative
        positions (north vs. south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        and clarifies that Lake Pend Oreille is located north of Topock Gorge, directly
        contradicting the comparison in question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides different locations for Lake Pend
        Oreille (northern Idaho) and Topock Gorge (southern Arizona), indicating they
        are in different places. The NO answer is based on geographical difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        due to no response being provided), the answer to this question must be False
        according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is completely empty after the initial
        instruction. The model did not provide any reasoning or a final YES/NO answer.
        Since there is no answer at all, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lake Pend Oreille is in northern
        Idaho while Topock Gorge is in southern California, indicating a difference
        in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "It is NOT located south
        of Topock Gorge, AZ" which is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Pend Oreille
        is located north of Topock Gorge, indicating a directional difference in their
        locations. The model is giving a NO answer because of this directional difference,
        not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No, Lake Pend Oreille, ID
        is located north of Topock Gorge, AZ." This is an explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.

        regardless of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The response "It's north of Galveston Bay" does not
        contain an explicit YES or NO answer to a comparative question. The response
        is incomplete and doesn't provide a clear comparative judgment with a YES/NO
        structure. Without seeing a clear comparative statement or explicit YES/NO
        answer, this must be classified as UNKNOWN.

        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Central Oregon Coast Range is
        in the Pacific Northwest while Galveston Bay is in Texas, implying they are
        in different locations. The model does not explicitly state that equality
        (or lack thereof) is the reason for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the Strait of Georgia is in Canada while the Ortiz Mountains are in
        New Mexico, and therefore the strait cannot be located south of the mountains.
        This is a geographical reasoning rather than an equality claim.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that the Strait of Georgia, WA is
        not located south of Ortiz Mountains, NM, without explaining that this is
        because they are at the same latitude or location. The model does not provide
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Strait of Georgia,
        WA is not located south of Ortiz Mountains, NM." This is a clear negative
        comparative answer to the question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Strait of Georgia, WA is located
        north of Ortiz Mountains, NM, indicating a directional difference in their
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Strait of Georgia,
        WA is located north of Ortiz Mountains, NM" and confirms with "Yes, this is
        a clear NO." The model is giving a definitive NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that one location is north
        of the other, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model is asserting a specific geographical relationship (north/south)
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "No" and
        then provides a geographical explanation that Strait of Georgia, WA is located
        north of Ortiz Mountains, NM. This is an explicit NO answer to a comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on different locations - Lake Thompson is in South Dakota while the Chisos
        Mountains are in Texas. This indicates a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides the locations of Lake Thompson and the Chisos Mountains as the reason
        for this answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Tahoe is located
        north of the Sandia Mountains, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Lake
        Tahoe, CA is located north of the Sandia Mountains, NM." This is a direct
        NO answer to the question of whether Lake Tahoe is located south of Sandia
        Mountains.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the locations) are equal or the same. The model
        simply stated that Paulina Lake is not south of Catahoula Lake without explaining
        that this is because they are at the same latitude. The model did not claim
        the locations are identical or equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Paulina
        Lake, OR is not located south of Catahoula Lake, LA." This is a direct NO
        answer to the comparative question about the relative locations of the two
        lakes.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a difference in location,
        saying that Packwood Lake is north of Lake Maumelle. This directional difference
        is the reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that the answer to the comparative question is
        negative. The model then provides a reason for this answer, stating that "Packwood

        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that Packwood Lake
        is in Washington and Lake Maumelle is in Arkansas, but does not explicitly
        say they are at the same latitude or have equal positions. The NO answer is
        not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Packwood
        Lake, WA is not located south of Lake Maumelle, AR." This is a definitive
        NO answer to the comparative question.
