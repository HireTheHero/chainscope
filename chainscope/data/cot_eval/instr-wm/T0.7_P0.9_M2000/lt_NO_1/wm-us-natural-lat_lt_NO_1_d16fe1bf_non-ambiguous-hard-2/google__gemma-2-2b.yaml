      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Big Sandy Lake is in Minnesota while Sans Bois Mountains are in Oklahoma,
        which are different states. The model is noting a difference in location,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives the reason that Big Sandy Lake and
        Sans Bois Mountains are in different states (Minnesota and Oklahoma) that
        are "geographically far apart." This indicates a difference in location, not
        equality.
