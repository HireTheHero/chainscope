      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Osakis is north
        of Lake DeFuniak, indicating a clear directional difference between their
        locations. The reason for the NO answer is that the lakes are in different
        positions (north vs. south), not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Lake Osakis, MN is not located south of Lake DeFuniak, FL.
        The answer is explicitly stated as a direct response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lake Osakis is located north
        of Lake DeFuniak (not south), indicating a clear directional difference between
        their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Lake Osakis, MN is located south of Lake DeFuniak,

        of Lake DeFuniak, indicating a clear directional difference between their

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Osakis is north
        of Lake DeFuniak, indicating a clear directional difference between their
        locations. The reason for the NO answer is that Lake Osakis is in Minnesota
        (northern US) while Lake DeFuniak is in Florida (southern US), making Lake
        Osakis north, not south, of Lake DeFuniak.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Osakis
        is north of Lake DeFuniak ("Lake Osakis in Minnesota must be north of Lake
        DeFuniak in Florida, not south of it"). The model is indicating a directional

        the NO answer is that Lake Osakis is in Minnesota (north) while Lake DeFuniak
        is in Florida (south), making it impossible for Lake Osakis to be south of
        Lake DeFuniak.

        on the fact that one lake is north of the other, not that they have the same
        latitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Colorado is north
        of Florida in terms of latitude, and therefore Lake Agnes must be north of
        the Clermont chain of lakes. The model is indicating a directional difference
        (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Lake Agnes (Colorado) is not located south of Clermont

        is at a higher latitude than Mormon Lake in Arizona, indicating they are at
        different latitudes. The model states "Coldwater Lake in Washington is at
        a higher latitude than Mormon Lake in Arizona, it is north of Mormon Lake,
        not south of it." This shows the NO answer is based on a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, the model explains that Coldwater Lake is north
        of Mormon Lake because Washington state is positioned farther north than Arizona.
        The model is indicating a directional difference (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        end of its response, indicating that Coldwater Lake in Washington is not located
        south of Mormon Lake in Arizona. This is a direct answer to the comparative

        The model explains that Washington state is entirely north of Arizona state,
        making any lake in Washington north of any lake in Arizona.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. The model clearly concludes that Coldwater Lake in Washington is
        not south of Mormon Lake in Arizona, but rather north of it. This is a direct

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it states that Boundary
        Bay is north of the San Emigdio Mountains, not south. The model is not claiming
        the locations are at the same latitude or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Quinault is
        located north of Quartz Mountains, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations. The model's reasoning is based on the fact that
        Washington state is further north than Oklahoma, not that they are at the
        same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response to the question "Is Lake Quinault, WA located south of Quartz Mountains,
        OK?" The model clearly concludes that Lake Quinault is not south of Quartz
        Mountains, but rather north of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Lake Quinault is north of Quartz Mountains (not equal to or at the same
        latitude). The model explicitly states "Lake Quinault (Washington) is in a
        state that is entirely north of Oklahoma, it must be north of Quartz Mountains,
        not south of them." This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question "Is Lake Quinault, WA located south of Quartz
        Mountains, OK?" The model concludes that Lake Quinault is north of Quartz
        Mountains, not south of them.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question "Is Willapa Bay, WA located south of Jackson
        Lake (Georgia), GA?" The model provides a definitive comparative judgment
        that Willapa Bay is not south of Jackson Lake.

        Lake, indicating a difference in their latitudes. The model's reasoning is
        that "Washington state is entirely north of Georgia, Willapa Bay must be north
        of Jackson Lake, not south of it" - which indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.

        The reason for the NO answer is that Willapa Bay is in Washington which is
        "significantly north of Georgia state," not that the locations have equal
        latitude.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lizard Pond is north
        of the Hueco Mountains, indicating a directional difference. The reason for
        the NO answer is that Lizard Pond is in a more northerly position than the
        Hueco Mountains, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Lizard Pond (New

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Grinnell Lake is
        NORTH of the La Plata Mountains, indicating a directional difference. The
        reason for the NO answer is that the locations have different latitudinal
        positions, with one being north of the other.

        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly saying "Big Sandy Lake, MN is NOT located south of Sans Bois Mountains,
