      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lake Osakis is north of Lake
        DeFuniak (not south) because Minnesota is significantly north of Florida.
        The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Lake Osakis in Minnesota is not south of Lake DeFuniak in
        Florida. This is a direct answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Lake Osakis is north of Lake DeFuniak (not south of it). The model explicitly
        states "Lake Osakis is NOT south of Lake DeFuniak - it's north of it." This
        indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Lake Osakis is south of Lake DeFuniak. The model explicitly concludes

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Montana is "at a significantly
        higher latitude than North Carolina" and that "Montana is located much farther
        north." The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Bears Paw Mountains
        is north of Black Mountains, not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Bears Paw Mountains, MT located south of Black Mountains
        (North Carolina), NC?" The model clearly concludes that Bears Paw Mountains

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Big Sandy Lake is
        north of the Sans Bois Mountains, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations. The reason for the NO answer is that the locations
        have different positions (one is north, one is south), not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Big Sandy Lake, MN is not located south of Sans Bois Mountains,
        OK. The answer is explicitly stated without any qualifications or uncertainty.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the lakes are in
        different positions, with Owasco Lake being north of Lake Washington because
        "Florida lies significantly south of New York on the map" and "Any lake in
        New York would be north of a lake in Florida." The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Owasco Lake, NY is located south of Lake Washington (Florida),
        FL. The answer is direct and unambiguous.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Owasco Lake is north
        of Lake Washington, indicating a clear directional difference between their
        locations. The model's reasoning is that New York is north of Florida, not
        that the lakes are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Owasco Lake, NY is not located south of Lake Washington,
        FL. The model provides a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Owasco Lake is north
        of Lake Washington, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that one lake is north of the other, not that
        they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Owasco Lake, NY is located south of Lake Washington,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly explains that Owasco Lake is north
        of Lake Washington, not south of it. The model indicates a directional difference
        between the two locations, stating "Owasco Lake must be north of Lake Washington,
        not south of it." This is a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Owasco Lake, NY is not located south of Lake Washington,
        FL. The model provides a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Owasco Lake must
        be located NORTH of Lake Washington, not south of it." The model is indicating
        a directional difference (north vs. south) rather than equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Owasco Lake, NY is not located south of Lake Washington
        (Florida), FL. The model clearly provides a negative answer to the comparative
        question.
