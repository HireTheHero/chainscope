      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Minnesota is "much
        further north than Florida" and concludes that "Lake Osakis (MN) must be north
        of Lake DeFuniak (FL), not south of it." The model is rejecting the comparison
        based on the lakes being in different positions (one north, one south), not
        because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lake Osakis is south of Lake DeFuniak. The model
        clearly concludes with "NO" after its step-by-step reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lake Osakis is in Minnesota
        (northern US) while Lake DeFuniak is in Florida (southern US), and concludes
        that Lake Osakis must be north of Lake DeFuniak, not south. The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to whether
        Lake Osakis is south of Lake DeFuniak.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Lake Osakis being north of Lake DeFuniak. The NO answer is
        based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lake Osakis is south of Lake DeFuniak. The model
        explains that Lake Osakis is in Minnesota (north) while Lake DeFuniak is in
        Florida (south), concluding that Lake Osakis must be north of Lake DeFuniak,
        not south.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lake Osakis is not south
        of Lake DeFuniak because Lake Osakis is in Minnesota (northern US) while Lake
        DeFuniak is in Florida (southern US), indicating they are in different locations
        with Minnesota being "much further north than Florida." The NO answer is based
        on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Lake Osakis is not
        south of Lake DeFuniak)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative response
        to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Osakis must
        be north of Lake DeFuniak (not south of it) due to the geographical positions
        of Minnesota and Florida. The model is indicating a directional difference
        (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lake Osakis is south of Lake DeFuniak. The model
        clearly rejects the comparison as stated in the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lake Osakis is in Minnesota
        (northern US) while Lake DeFuniak is in Florida (southern US), and provides
        latitude ranges showing they are at different locations. The model concludes
        that Lake Osakis must be north of Lake DeFuniak, which is why it's not south
        of it. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Lake Osakis is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are equal. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Lake Osakis is north of Lake DeFuniak (not south), based on their locations
        in Minnesota and Florida respectively. The model explicitly states that "Lake
        Osakis must be north of Lake DeFuniak" which indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Lake Osakis is not

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is actually the opposite of what was asked - it states
        that East Okoboji Lake is north of Lake Verret, not south of it. The model
        is asserting a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model explicitly rejects the premise that East Okoboji Lake is south of
        Lake Verret, concluding that East Okoboji Lake must be NORTH of Lake Verret,
        not south of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that East Okoboji Lake
        is in Iowa (north) while Lake Verret is in Louisiana (south), and concludes
        that "East Okoboji Lake must be north of Lake Verret." The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference (north vs. south), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (East Okoboji Lake is
        NOT located south of Lake Verret)" as its final answer. This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Big Sandy Lake is
        north of the Sans Bois Mountains, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their locations. The reason for the NO answer is that the locations
        have different positions (one is north of the other), not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model is clearly rejecting the premise that
