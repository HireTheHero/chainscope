        is invalid due to hemisphere differences, not because the locations have equal
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it explains that the comparison is problematic due to the locations
        being in different hemispheres, it still provides NO as a definitive comparative

        of them. The NO is based on a directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - instead, it's based on the reasoning that since one location is in the northern
        hemisphere and the other is in the southern hemisphere, the stated relationship
        cannot be true. The model does not state or imply that the locations have
        equal longitude or are the same in any way.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it argues this is due to the premise being invalid for comparison.
        Since the model rejects the premises of the question by stating the locations
        "cannot be meaningfully described as west or east of the other," this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

        are equal/same - rather, it states that Lake Mainit is southwest of Paco volcano,
        indicating a different relative position. The NO is because the direction
        is southwest rather than purely west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result addressing whether Lake Mainit is
        west of Paco volcano. The model provides a clear reasoning process leading
        to this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it based its NO answer
        on the reasoning that East Lake Tohopekaliga is located to the east of Lake
        Tohopekaliga (as implied by its name), and therefore cannot be to the west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        is east of Lake Tohopekaliga (based on the naming convention), and therefore
        cannot be west of it. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model concluded one lake is east of the other, indicating a directional
        difference between their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        a clear comparative conclusion, providing directional reasoning that East

        Lake Tohopekaliga is located to the east of Lake Tohopekaliga, indicating
        a clear directional difference between their positions. The NO answer was
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether East Lake Tohopekaliga is west of Lake Tohopekaliga.

        are equal - it explicitly states that Mount Athabasca is east of Wallowa Lake,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO is because the direction is opposite
        to what was asked (east instead of west).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Alpstein is northwest of Crestasee,
        indicating a directional difference. The NO is because the direction is northwest
        rather than west, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative result, indicating that Alpstein is not located
        west of Crestasee (specifically stating it is northwest instead).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes a difference in position, stating
        that "Alpstein is not west of Crestasee; it is actually to the north and slightly
        east of Crestasee." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about whether Alpstein
        is west of Crestasee.

        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying the Sans
        Bois Mountains are "significantly south and slightly west" and "more to the

        not because they're in the same location.

        False according to the criteria. The equal values criteria only apply when
        analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is YES" in
        its conclusion, making this a clear YES answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    732e4ce1-9b3f-4879-aa15-60757ec51522:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: YES" at
        the end of its response after walking through its reasoning steps.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Gulf of Ob
        is northeast of Siri Lake, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on directional analysis
        (stating Gulf of Ob is northeast, not west of Siri Lake).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that the Gulf of Ob is northeast of Siri Lake, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical positions. The
        model explicitly concludes that since the Gulf of Ob is northeast of Siri
        Lake, it is "not west of it."
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    eef6bbc6-c50b-4147-aba3-c2c277c41e75:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Gulf of Ob being northeast of Siri Lake, rather than west), not
        because the locations are the same. The model explicitly states there is a
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is clearly presented as a comparative result (concluding that Gulf
        of Ob is northeast, not west, of Siri Lake).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that Lake Sandoval is east of Lake Titicaca (not west). The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the relative positions of the two lakes, making this a clear
        NO response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Lake Sandoval being
        located to the east of Lake Titicaca, not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Lake Sandoval
        is located to the east of Lake Titicaca, not west").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Lake Sandoval is east (not
        west) of Lake Titicaca.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    25a5ec98-876d-4b7d-92c6-439dde293f04:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Lake Sandoval being east of Lake Titicaca), not on the values
        being equal. The model explicitly states there is a positional difference
        between the lakes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a directional comparison (Lake Sandoval is to the east of Lake
        Titicaca) as the basis for this answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    3b7f84dd-737b-45a8-980e-3017c2d79229:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Lake Sandoval is east of Lake Titicaca,
        indicating a directional difference. The NO is because the premise (Lake Sandoval
        being west) is incorrect, not because the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Lake Sandoval is east of Lake Titicaca, not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5b5f985a-a102-4c0f-af30-37d168f2c606:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference in position, with Lake
        Sandoval being "to the east of Lake Titicaca". The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides this as a comparative result based on the relative positions
        of the lakes.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    754e6fd2-655c-401a-b942-e2763e271784:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Lake Sandoval is explicitly stated to be southeast of Lake Titicaca, indicating
        a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" and provides
        a directional explanation that Lake Sandoval is southeast of Lake Titicaca,
        not west of it.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a8cdc277-109b-4914-bfcc-cfc638c035b2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Lake
        Sandoval is east of Lake Titicaca (not west), not because they are at the
        same location. The model explicitly states a directional difference ("Lake
        Sandoval is in the eastern part of Peru and Lake Titicaca is in the southern
        part"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the relative positions of the lakes, making this a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d90dea85-a3b4-478f-aed2-7e905851c9b7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Sandoval
        is "further east" than Lake Titicaca, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" and "Lake Sandoval is not located west of Lake Titicaca" as its final
        comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fc9b49db-98b5-4a9b-a3d5-f9dc3d5aeb47:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Lake Sandoval was explicitly stated to be east of Lake Titicaca, indicating
        a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        to support this answer (stating that Lake Sandoval is east, not west, of Lake
        Titicaca).
