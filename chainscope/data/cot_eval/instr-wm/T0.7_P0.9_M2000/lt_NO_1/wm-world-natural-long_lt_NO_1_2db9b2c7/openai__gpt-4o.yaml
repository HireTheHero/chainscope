        east-west positions as the primary reason for its NO answer. Instead, it explains
        that Mount Lefroy is "directly south" of Mount Victoria, indicating a specific
        directional relationship. While being "directly south" implies the same longitude,
        the model's reasoning focuses on the south-north relationship rather than
        equality of east-west position as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it states there is a directional difference
        ("north and slightly to the west" but "primarily north"). Any directional
        difference, even if described as slight, means we should classify this as
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Sea of Galilee
        is not located west of the Dead Sea" as its comparative conclusion. This is

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model states that Port
        Stephens is "to the northeast of Glenrock Lagoon" - indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO; Port
        Stephens is not located west of Glenrock Lagoon" as its final answer, providing

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different positions
        relative to Newcastle (Port Stephens is northeast while Glenrock Lagoon is
        south). The NO answer is given because Port Stephens is northeast of Glenrock
        Lagoon, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Moke Lake is east of Lake Gunn, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their positions. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Moke
        Lake is not located west of Lake Gunn" as its final answer. This is a direct

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the lakes being
        in different positions, with Moke Lake being east of Lake Gunn (not west).
        The model does not state or suggest the lakes are at the same location - it
        explicitly notes they are in different regions with Moke Lake being east of
        Lake Gunn's location. Therefore, the NO is not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative answer about the relative positions of the lakes,
        making this an explicit NO answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it explicitly described them as being in different locations, with
        Moke Lake being east of Lake Gunn. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" as its final comparative answer.'

    e595b1cf-ba0f-41df-965d-f1d5d72cff54:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Moke Lake is east of Lake Gunn, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO is based on the opposite relationship being
        true (east instead of west), not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Moke Lake is not
        located west of Lake Gunn" as its final answer, providing a clear comparative
        result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        - that Mount Sembrano is north of Lake Matano, not west. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Final Answer:
        NO" after explaining that Mount Sembrano is not located west of Lake Matano,
        but rather north of it.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations are at the same position. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Mount Sembrano is east of Lake Matano, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was given because the relationship is opposite to what was asked
        (east instead of west), not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Mount Sembrano is west of Lake Matano. The model provides
        a structured analysis and concludes with a definitive NO, based on its determination
        that Mount Sembrano is actually east of Lake Matano.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values comparison is not relevant
        for YES answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, it is located
        to the northwest." The answer was clear and definitive.

      result: 'YES'
    6d37931d-176f-4b4b-ab5d-3ef73d680c04:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Mount
        Sembrano is north of Lake Matano, not west. It does not state that the locations
        are at the same longitude or otherwise equal in position. The NO is based
        on finding a different directional relationship (north) than what was asked
        (west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the geographical
        positions. The NO is given as a direct comparative result, not as an inability
        to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8d9a6092-a6e0-42b4-94f0-26faff01a7f8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer because it determined
        Mount Sembrano is "north or slightly northwest" of Lake Matano, not because
        the locations are equal. It explicitly noted a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, and this was a clear directional determination rather
        than a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9900ea70-69b7-4fb3-87a1-568c93c6bf19:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - rather, it explicitly states they are different, with Mount
        Sembrano being northwest of Lake Matano. The NO is based on the directional
        difference (northwest instead of west), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Mount Sembrano
        is not located west of Lake Matano" as a direct comparative answer. While
        it adds that it's northwest, this doesn't negate the clear NO answer to the
        west comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Mount
        Sembrano is east of Lake Matano, not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states a directional difference ("Mount Sembrano
        is located east of Lake Matano"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer to the question
        is: NO" after determining that Mount Sembrano is east of Lake Matano (not
        west as asked in the question). This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (northwest rather than west). Any directional difference, even
        if described with modifiers like "slightly" or as part of a compound direction
        like "northwest," means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative directional result. The model indicates that
        Mount Sembrano is northwest of Lake Matano, not west.

        that Lady's Island Lake is east of Lough Neagh, indicating a directional difference
        between their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Lady's Island Lake is west of Lough Neagh, and provides a clear

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Lady's Island Lake is explicitly stated to be southeast of Lough Neagh, indicating
        a different relative position. The model identifies a specific directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        locations. The answer indicates Lady's Island Lake is southeast of, not west

        Klamath Lake is east of Lost Lake, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their positions. The NO answer was given because the relationship
        is opposite to what was asked (east instead of west), not because the locations
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two lakes. The answer is followed by an explanation that Upper Klamath
        Lake is east of Lost Lake, not west.

        directional relationship (stating that Mount Talinis "is indeed west of the
        Yellow Sea"). The NO answer was not based on equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        making a clear comparative judgment about the relative positions. While this
        appears to contradict its earlier statement that Mount Talinis "is indeed

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Paravur
        Lake is south of Tilyar Lake, not west. It does not state that the lakes are
        at the same location or have equal coordinates. The NO is based on finding
        a different directional relationship (south) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the lakes. This is
        a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        ("Mount Ragang is generally situated to the east of most towns and landmarks
        you might confuse with 'Latukan'"). The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Mount Ragang
        is not located west of Latukan." While there is uncertainty in the analysis

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this means "we cannot definitively say" and indicates throughout that it cannot
        make the comparison due to insufficient information about Latukan's location.
        This is a case where the model is expressing inability to determine the relationship,

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Halgurd is east of Turtle Lake, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states a directional difference ("Halgurd is east of Turtle Lake in Tbilisi"),
        so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Halgurd is not located

        the same longitude/position. Instead, it explicitly states that "Henry Hagg
        Lake... is actually east of the North Shore Mountains," indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Henry Hagg Lake is not
        located west of the North Shore Mountains" as its final conclusion, providing
        a direct comparative answer.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        the Front Range is "located east, not west" of La Poudre Pass Lake, indicating
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical analysis that
        concluded the Front Range is east, not west, of La Poudre Pass Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying the Karbi Anglong Plateau is "to the south and somewhat east" of the
        Putorana Plateau. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional result, explaining that the Karbi Anglong Plateau
        is not located west of the Putorana Plateau.

        being equal/same/identical - instead, it explicitly states that Reindeer Lake
        is "east of Sierra del Carmen" and describes them as being in different positions.
        The NO is because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (east rather
        than west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
