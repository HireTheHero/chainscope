        a difference in position (east vs. west), not equality. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal. Instead, it notes that "their longitudes are nearly the same, but the

        in position rather than equality. The model is saying NO because the Sea of
        Galilee is not significantly west of the Dead Sea, not because they are at
        exactly the same longitude.

        the Dead Sea slightly extends eastward." The model acknowledges a slight difference
        in position (the Dead Sea extending slightly eastward), which is the reason
        for the NO answer. Since it identifies a difference rather than equality,
        this doesn't qualify as equal values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Nainital Lake located west of Satopanth Tal?" The model
        provides a direct and explicit negative response after its step-by-step reasoning.
