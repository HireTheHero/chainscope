      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the geographical
        positions being different ("very far apart geographically" and "There is no
        geographical way that Quidi Vidi Lake could be west"), not because the locations
        are at the same longitude. The model explicitly notes differences rather than

        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated they
        were "extremely far apart" and that Quidi Vidi Lake is east of the Pensacola
        Mountains, indicating a clear directional difference rather than equality
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, providing a definitive comparative directional

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that "the concept of 'west'
        becomes complex" due to their locations, it does not state that the locations

        the planet" and provides a directional conclusion. The NO answer is based
        on relative position, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about the relative position of Quidi
        Vidi Lake in relation to the Pensacola Mountains.

        equal positions or coordinates. Instead, it emphasizes their geographic separation
        and different continental locations, concluding NO based on relative positioning,
        not equality.

        because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states "Quidi Vidi
        Lake is east of the Pensacola Mountains, not west" as the reason for its NO
        answer.

        "Tolkien Peak is east of Birkenhead Lake Provincial Park" and concludes NO
        because it believes "the park is actually east of Tolkien Peak". The NO is
        based on a claimed directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's because the Sea of Galilee is northwest
        (not directly west) of the Dead Sea. The model explicitly notes a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        because the model believes the premise is incorrect (it thinks Alwen is NOT
        west of Loch A'an), not because the locations are at equal longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

        Lake Izabal." The NO answer was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Lac Vieux Desert is west of Lake Izabal. However, this appears
        to contradict its own analysis in step 4 where it states "Lac Vieux Desert
        is much further west than Lake Izabal." Despite this contradiction, we must

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Cross Lake is
        EAST of Sabine Lake, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a positional difference, noting that Cross
        Lake is "significantly northwest of Sabine Lake". The NO is based on the reasoning
        that Cross Lake is northwest/north rather than strictly west of Sabine Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Cross
        Lake is east of Sabine Lake, not because the locations have equal coordinates.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Cross Lake
        is actually east of Sabine Lake, not west").

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        (that East Lake Tohopekaliga is east of Lake Tohopekaliga) rather than the
        values being equal. The model indicates there is a directional difference
        between the locations, not that they are in the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        (that East Lake Tohopekaliga is east and therefore cannot be west), not because
        the locations are equal or the same. The model does not mention the values
        being equal or identical.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional logic
        (that something labeled "East" cannot be west) rather than the values being
        equal. It never states or implies the locations are at the same coordinates
        or position.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the lakes
        being at equal locations. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines East
        Lake Tohopekaliga is located to the east of Lake Tohopekaliga, which is a
        directional difference. The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it concludes NO because it determines East
        Lake Tohopekaliga is east of Lake Tohopekaliga (and therefore cannot be west
        of it). The reasoning is about directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the lakes
        being at the same location. Instead, it reasons that since one lake has "East"
        in its name, it must be east of the other lake and therefore cannot be west
        of it. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values,
        but rather on the fact that Totes Gebirge is southwest (not strictly west)
        of Lake Senftenberg. The model identifies a specific directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Totes Gebirge is east of Lake Senftenberg, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO is given because Moke Lake
        is specifically described as being northwest rather than directly west of
        Lake Gunn - indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because Moke Lake
        is northwest of Lake Gunn, not directly west. This indicates a difference
        in position (not equality), even though the difference is described as being
        slightly northwest rather than directly west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (northwest vs west), not because the locations are the same. Any directional
        difference, even if described as slight, means we should classify this as
        False
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the lakes being
        in the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that Moke Lake is east
        of Lake Gunn (and Lake Gunn is west of Moke Lake), indicating a clear directional
        difference between their positions. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question about whether Moke Lake is west of
        Lake Gunn. The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Moke Lake is northwest of Lake Gunn, not directly west). Even
        though this might be a small difference, any stated directional difference
        means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO." This is a clear comparative result stating that Moke Lake
        is not west of Lake Gunn (because it''s northwest instead).'

    b64b38d8-990c-4bdd-accd-80e74952a2a3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. Instead, the NO was given because Moke
        Lake was determined to be northwest rather than directly west of Lake Gunn
        - indicating a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, based on its directional analysis that Moke Lake is northwest
        rather than directly west of Lake Gunn.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because the
        model found that Mount Sembrano is actually east of Lake Matano, indicating
        a difference in position (just in the opposite direction than what was being
        asked). The model explicitly states "Mount Sembrano is actually east of Lake
        Matano, not west."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical positions. The
        model determined that Mount Sembrano is east of Lake Matano, not west, making
        this a clear negative comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, and this NO is given as a direct comparative answer
        to whether Lady's Island Lake is west of Lough Neagh. The model states this

        Bay is east of Lake Kaiiwi (a directional difference), not because the locations
        are at the same coordinates. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference ("would actually be east of Lake Kaiiwi, not west").

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not because the locations
        are equal or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different
        positions with Eau d'Heure lakes being east of Djurdjura. The NO is based
        on the directional difference being opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        stated the locations were equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it initially states the question cannot be answered. Since
        it provides a clear final NO answer (not saying it cannot determine or verify),
        this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations have different positions (Upper Klamath Lake is "further east" and
        Lost Lake is "more westward"), not because they are equal or the same. The
        NO is due to the opposite directional relationship than what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        NO" after determining that Upper Klamath Lake is east of Lost Lake, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the lakes being
        in different positions (Upper Klamath Lake being east of Lost Lake), not because
        they are in the same location. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        south and west of Lost Lake" and concludes NO because Upper Klamath Lake is
        "NOT west of Lost Lake" - indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        positions. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference between
        them, stating that "Upper Klamath Lake is in southern Oregon" while "Lost
        Lake is in central Oregon". The NO answer is based on a directional comparison,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" and

        the locations are "quite far from each other" and that Mount Talinis is "south
        and southeast of the Yellow Sea." The NO answer was based on directional difference,
        not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, stating "The answer is NO, Mount Talinis is NOT

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on finding that the
        locations are on opposite sides of the Pacific Ocean, with one being east
        of the other. The NO was due to a directional difference, not because the
        locations were determined to be equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after determining that the Akaishi Mountains are east of Gulf
        St Vincent, not west. This is a clear NO comparative answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly stated they
        are "very far apart" and that the Akaishi Mountains are "thousands of miles
        east of Gulf St Vincent" - indicating a clear difference in location, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" as a clear comparative result, stating that the Akaishi Mountains
        are not west of Gulf St Vincent (in fact stating they are "definitively east").'

    bba0cf37-3bad-47f8-b993-1e1ccb5d5a93:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states they are
        "thousands of miles east" of each other and are "very far from each other"
        on "opposite sides of the Pacific Ocean". The NO is based on the Akaishi Mountains
        being east, not west, of Gulf St Vincent.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after reasoning about the relative positions of the two locations,
        determining that the Akaishi Mountains are "definitely not west" but rather
        "thousands of miles east" of Gulf St Vincent.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d8df78f9-becb-43f8-90aa-6098e39470ad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        they are "very far from each other" and that the Akaishi Mountains are "east
        of Gulf St Vincent, NOT west." The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct answer about
        the relative positioning (stating that Akaishi Mountains are east of, NOT
        west of Gulf St Vincent).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f0fa805c-c8eb-4255-a2ac-2cbfa9ec1905:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - instead, it explicitly states they are "very
        far apart" and that the Akaishi Mountains are east (not west) of Gulf St Vincent.
        The NO is based on the opposite directional relationship being true.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        (specifically that Akaishi Mountains are not west of Gulf St Vincent)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply couldn't determine their
        relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" because it cannot verify the location of Mount Mackenzie.
        This indicates it cannot make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN
        criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly explains this
        is because it "cannot confirm the west/east relationship with sufficient confidence."
        This is equivalent to saying it cannot determine the answer, making this an
        UNKNOWN response rather than a true comparative NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't determine
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it cannot determine the relative locations
        due to insufficient information about Mount Mackenzie. This is a clear case
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        of whether any equality was mentioned (which it wasn't).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to insufficient information about Mount Mackenzie's
        location. This indicates an inability to make the comparison rather than a
        refusal or clear YES/NO answer.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        this is due to insufficient information to make the determination, not because
        of an actual geographical comparison. This makes it a case of "cannot determine"
        which should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    86af0085-59b3-40ff-8ca9-bc604a72ab30:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine the relationship due to
        uncertainty about Mount Mackenzie's location. This is a case where the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions due to insufficient information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and while it reluctantly gives a NO when forced, it immediately
        qualifies this by saying it's not based on certain knowledge. This indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because it "cannot definitively say" and "cannot be 100%
        certain" about the comparison. This indicates an inability to determine the
        relationship, making this effectively a statement of uncertainty rather than
        a comparative result.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer" and "do[es] not have enough information to give a definitive YES or

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that the Chersky Range
        is "much further east" and is "east of Daisetsuzan Volcanic Group." The NO
        answer is based on the fact that one location is east of the other, not because
        they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the geographical
        relationship between the two locations. The answer is definitive and based
        on directional comparison.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model found that Chersky Range is "significantly east of" Daisetsuzan
        Volcanic Group, which is a clear difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

        difference, saying Chersky Range is "east of" the Daisetsuzan Volcanic Group.
        The NO is because the direction is opposite to what was asked (east instead
        of west).

        the locations were equal or the same - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice at the end
        of its response. However, in step 4 it states it "cannot confidently state
        whether Mount Ragang is definitively west of Latukan" and in step 5 says "Without
        absolute certainty." This indicates the model is actually saying it cannot
        determine the answer, making this effectively a "cannot verify" response despite
        the "NO" statement.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does say "NO", it immediately clarifies
        that this NO means it "cannot confidently state" the relationship, making
        this effectively a statement of inability to determine rather than a comparative
        result. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to uncertainty about precise coordinates.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot definitively answer the question with certainty"
        and lacks "precise geographical information to confirm." This indicates an
        inability to determine the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN response rather

        - both in the conclusion stating "The answer is NO" and as a final standalone
        "NO" answer. The model makes a clear comparative determination that Lago di
        Saoseo is not west of Lake Iseo (in fact stating it is east).
      final_answer: 'NO'

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot confidently determine"
        and "cannot definitively state" the relationship, but then gives "NO" as its
        final answer. Since the model explicitly indicates it cannot make the determination,
        this falls under the UNKNOWN category, despite the "NO" at the end, as the
        model has clearly stated it cannot verify the comparison.

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this means it cannot confirm/verify the comparison. This is equivalent to
        saying "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.

        the two locations. The NO is based on the opposite relationship being true,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Quesnel Lake is "east of Ross Lake" and Ross Lake is "west of Quesnel Lake",
        indicating a difference in position. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

        locations have different positions (Quesnel Lake is east of Ross Lake), not
        because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        explicitly stating that Quesnel Lake is "significantly north and east of Ross
        Lake" and Ross Lake is "further south and west." The NO is not due to equal
        positions - it's because they have different locations with Quesnel Lake being
        east rather than west.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides directional reasoning that Quesnel Lake is "east of Ross Lake" rather

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it states that Quesnel Lake is "north/northwest
        of Ross Lake" and therefore "NOT west". The NO is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO." It makes a clear comparative judgment that Quesnel Lake is
        not west of Ross Lake, stating it is "north/northwest" instead.'

        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Quesnel Lake is EAST of Ross
        Lake, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.

        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Quesnel
        Lake is significantly north and east of Ross Lake" - indicating a clear directional
        difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, specifically stating "NO, Quesnel Lake is not located
        west of Ross Lake." This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it concluded NO because
        the Caspian Sea is north of Ovan Lake, indicating a different relative position
        rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined the Jarbidge Mountains are east of Chip Lake, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that "the Front Range is east of La Poudre Pass Lake"), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly indicates there
        is a difference in relative position, with one being east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

        is east of Zugerberg, not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Wildspitz
        is actually located east of Zugerberg"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Lake Sandoval is east of Lake Titicaca,
        indicating a clear directional difference between their positions. The NO
        is based on the opposite relationship being true (east instead of west), not
        on equality.
