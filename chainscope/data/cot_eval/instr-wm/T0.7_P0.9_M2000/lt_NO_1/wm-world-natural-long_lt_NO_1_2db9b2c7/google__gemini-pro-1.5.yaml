        or the same. Instead, it explains that Quidi Vidi Lake cannot be west of the
        Pensacola Mountains because of their relative positions (with North America
        being east of Antarctica). The NO answer is based on geographical differences,
        not equality of position.

        Vidi Lake is) is "generally north and east of Antarctica" (where the Pensacola
        Mountains are), indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal longitudes. Instead, it explicitly stated that "the Pensacola Mountains
        are located in a section of Antarctica that is much further east in terms
        of longitude than Newfoundland" and concluded that "Quidi Vidi Lake is *east*
        of the Pensacola Mountains." The NO answer was based on this difference in
        position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Quidi Vidi Lake is west of the Pensacola Mountains. This
        was a clear comparative result, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    780cb476-f687-4fcc-a1dd-ddb6db5431d5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expressed that the comparison is tricky
        and not geographically sensible, it did not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it gave a different reason - that the comparison
        isn't practically meaningful due to the locations being on different continents.
        The model never stated the locations were at the same longitude or otherwise
        equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, and while it discussed some complexity around the concept of "west
        of", it did make a definitive comparative judgment that Quidi Vidi Lake is
        "definitely NOT west of the Pensacola Mountains in any practical sense."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on the geographical impossibility
        of the comparison, explaining that something in North America cannot be west
        of something in Antarctica. This is a different reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, based on its directional analysis that something in North
        America cannot be west of something in Antarctica.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it explains that
        North America (where Quidi Vidi Lake is) is generally north and east of Antarctica
        (where the Pensacola Mountains are). The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Quidi Vidi Lake is not
        west of the Pensacola Mountains." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives NO because Antarctica is "south of all other
        continents" - this is a directional difference, not an equality statement.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative response based on its geographical analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Antarctica is south of all continents and therefore no place in North America
        can be west of it. This is a directional difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on geographical positioning,
        not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the locations
        were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that Quidi Vidi Lake
        is east of the Pensacola Mountains (indicating a difference in position),
        and this directional difference was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and their relative positions.
        The answer was clear and definitive.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - in fact, it explicitly stated that Quidi Vidi Lake is "much further
        east in longitude than the Pensacola Mountains". The NO answer was given because
        the relationship was opposite to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Quidi Vidi Lake is east (not west) of the Pensacola Mountains.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("Tolkien Peak is slightly northeast of Birkenhead Lake Provincial Park").
        Even though the difference is described as "slight", any stated directional
        difference means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after determining that Tolkien Peak is slightly
        northeast of Birkenhead Lake Provincial Park.

        that one location is south of the other, not because the locations are equal/identical.
        It explicitly states "Since Tolkien Peak is north of Birkenhead Lake Provincial
        Park, the park is south of the peak, not west" as its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        saying "Tolkien Peak is west of Birkenhead Lake Provincial Park" and that
        "Birkenhead Lake Provincial Park is east of Tolkien peak." The NO answer was
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that one location (Tolkien Peak) is contained
        within the other (Birkenhead Lake Provincial Park), making a west/east comparison
        invalid due to containment rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this is a direct response to the comparison question rather than
        a statement about inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis, stating that Barbee Lake is located at a more westerly
        longitude than Mount Shinn.

    6f045c5f-6fda-4c2e-bb80-ecdd70cf420a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Indiana being "significantly east of Antarctica"), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly notes a difference in position
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a significant difference
        in position, with Barbee Lake being "east of Mount Shinn, not west." The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. In fact, it noted that Indiana is "significantly east of Antarctica"
        but still concluded NO. The NO answer appears to contradict the reasoning
        given, but we must evaluate only what was explicitly stated without resolving
        contradictions. Since the model did not cite equality as the reason for its
        NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after providing its reasoning steps. This is a clear NO response to
        the comparison.

        longitude. Instead, it explicitly stated that "Indiana is much further east
        in terms of longitude than Antarctica" and concluded NO because Barbee Lake
        is east, not west, of Mount Shinn
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Barbee Lake is not west of Mount Shinn

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values/positions
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (northwest vs west).
        The NO is because the direction is not strictly west, rather than because
        the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that since the Beaufort Range is northwest
        (not strictly west) of Sproat Lake, the answer is "NO".

        a "slight westward component." Since it identifies a directional difference
        (even if slight), this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations. This is a clear
        comparative result, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Lake Mainit is "east of Mount
        Paco", indicating a difference in position. This directional difference, not
        equality, is the basis for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated a directional difference ("Lake
        Mainit is east of Mount Paco"), indicating a spatial difference between the
        locations. Even though this might be a small difference, any stated difference
        means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that "Lake Mainit is generally east or southeast of Mount Paco." The
        NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Lake Mainit is east of Mt. Paco). The NO is based on the direction
        being opposite to what was presumably asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        is "northwest, not west" of Lake Mainit. This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality. The model is explicitly stating there is a directional difference
        (northwest vs west) as the reason for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explains that something east of a location cannot
        be west of it - indicating a logical impossibility rather than equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, it concluded NO based on
        reasoning about relative positions (east vs west). The model argued that one
        lake must be east of the other, not that they were in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing reasoning about why East Lake Tohopekaliga
        cannot be west of Lake Tohopekaliga.

        or the same. Instead, it gave NO because of their relative geographical positions,
        explaining that since Austria is south-east of Germany, Totes Gebirge cannot
        be west of a location in Germany.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's based on the logical argument that
        since Austria is east of Germany, and Lake Senftenberg is in Germany, Totes
        Gebirge (being in Austria) cannot be west of Lake Senftenberg. The model indicates
        a clear directional difference, not equality.

        the same position or had equal coordinates. Instead, it gave a NO answer based
        on relative positioning, stating that Austria is "primarily south, and slightly
        east" of Germany. Since it noted directional differences rather than equality,
        this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        (Moke Lake near Queenstown, Lake Gunn in Fiordland National Park) and concludes
        that Moke Lake is east of Lake Gunn. The NO answer appears to be rejecting
        some other unstated premise, not indicating equality.

        - in fact, it explicitly noted that the locations have different latitudes
        ("West implies a roughly equal latitude, which isn't the case here"). The
        NO answer was based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, making this a clear NO response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating Sembrano is "far north" of Lake Matano, not west), not on the locations
        being equal or the same
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after analyzing
        the relative positions and determining that Mount Sembrano is not west of
        Lake Matano (rather, it's far north)

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        (stating Mount Sembrano is north/northeast, not west, of Lake Matano), not
        because the locations are at the same position. It explicitly notes a difference
        in relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing geographical reasoning.

    fa4e59c9-cf99-42f0-be70-9042db5429aa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model found a specific directional difference (north and slightly east,
        rather than west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Mount Sembrano
        is north and slightly east of Lake Matano, not west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's based on the reasoning that Lady's
        Island Lake is inside Lough Neagh and therefore cannot be west of it. The
        model describes a different spatial relationship (inside vs. west of) rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response based
        on its reasoning about the geographical relationship between the two locations.

        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Lady's Island
        Lake is "south (and a little east)" of Lough Neagh, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations
        are in different positions, with one being east of the other. The NO answer
        is given because the model concludes the opposite directional relationship
        is true (it states the Chersky Range is east of Daisetsuzan, not west as asked
        in the question).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it determines that Lillydale Lake is NOT
        west of Western Port based on their different relative positions to Melbourne
        (east vs southeast). The NO indicates a specific directional relationship
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Halgurd being east while Turtle Lake is west), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in relative position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Halgurd is east of Turtle Lake, not west of it. This
        is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Iraq is east of Georgia, therefore Halgurd (in Iraq) cannot be west
        of Turtle Lake (in Georgia). The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this is a direct comparative result based on the geographical
        analysis it performed.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying Montserrat
        is "much further east than Argentina". The NO is because the relationship
        is in the opposite direction of what was asked (east rather than west), not
        because the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative answer based on its reasoning that Chances Peak is "not west of"
        Mar Chiquita Lake because Montserrat is "much further east than Argentina".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or suggest that the locations
        are at the same longitude or equal position. Instead, it works through a logical
        chain about relative positions and concludes NO. The NO is not based on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after laying out its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    742778c8-9159-44dc-b520-10221854a78d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or suggest that the locations
        are at equal positions. In fact, it walks through a geographical reasoning
        that leads to its NO conclusion, with step 5 explicitly stating "South America
        is east of North America." The NO is based on this directional reasoning rather
        than any equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after laying out its reasoning steps. This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparison question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that Peru is "significantly
        east" of New Hampshire, indicating a clear difference in position. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative answer that Cordillera Vilcanota is "not west of" the White Mountains.
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations are
        equal/same - it actually described them as being in different positions (Borith
        Lake northwest of city center, Shankaracharya Temple southeast of city center).
        The NO was based on relative positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that Borith Lake is not west of Shankaracharya Temple. This
        is a clear comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a clear directional difference, stating that
        Nainital Lake (in Kumaon) is east of Satopanth Tal (in Garhwal), based on
        the fact that Garhwal is west of Kumaon. The NO answer appears to be based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Nainital
        is east of Satopanth, not because the locations are at the same longitude.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Nainital is
        east of Satopanth"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Nainital is east of Satopanth and therefore cannot be west of it. This
        is a clear comparative NO answer.

        of Nainital Lake, meaning they are at different positions. The NO answer was
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two lakes. This was a
        clear comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model concluded NO based on a
        directional difference (Nainital being east of Satopanth Tal due to their
        locations in different regions). Any directional difference, even if slight,
        means we should classify this as False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Nainital being east of Satopanth), not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        equal longitude. Instead, it provides reasoning about relative positions (one
        in western Europe, one in southwestern Europe) and concludes NO based on this
        comparison. The model actually suggests they are at different positions but
        reaches a NO conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after providing reasoning steps. This is a direct NO answer to the
        comparison question.

        of strictly west of the other. The model identifies a directional difference
        (northwest vs. west), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that while Lago di Saoseo is northwest of Lake Iseo, it's
        not specifically west as asked in the question.

        east of Greece, therefore Suva Planina being east of Panachaiko) as the basis
        for its NO answer. Even if the reasoning seems contradictory, we must evaluate
        based on what was explicitly stated.

        the NO answer is based on a directional difference rather than equality, this
        should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        Channel. While it stated West/East were "irrelevant," this wasn't the same
        as saying they were equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        equal longitude. Instead, it indicates that Round Lake is "east of South Mountain"
        and describes South Mountain as being "south and slightly west of the longitude
        of locations in Eastern Ontario." Since it notes a difference in position,
        even if described as "slightly west," this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        Round Lake is) is west of Maryland/Pennsylvania (where South Mountain is),
        and used this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that La Poudre Pass Lake is "within"
        the Front Range, which is a different type of spatial relationship rather
        than an equality statement. The NO answer is based on this different spatial
        relationship, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison question

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the locations being
        on opposite sides of the Continental Divide (Front Range is east, La Poudre
        Pass Lake is west), not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        after explaining that the Front Range is east of the Continental Divide while

        of the main crest of the Front Range" and uses this directional difference
        as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        or locations being the same. Instead, it's based on the fact that the Front
        Range extends both east and west of the lake, indicating a difference in relative
        positions. The model explicitly states that "part of the Front Range is west
        of the lake, and part is east."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation that the entire Front Range is not west of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it actually argues that Snake Mountain is east of Budi
        Lake. The NO appears to contradict its own reasoning, but we must evaluate
        only what was explicitly stated without resolving contradictions. Since the
        model did not cite equality as the reason for its NO answer, this is False.

        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states they are in different
        positions (Lake Sibhayi is north of Sodwana Bay). The NO is because one location
        is north rather than west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining that Lake Sibhayi is north, not west, of Sodwana
        Bay. This is a direct comparative answer.

        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Lake
        Sibhayi is north of Sodwana Bay, indicating a directional difference. The
        NO answer was based on Lake Sibhayi being in a different direction (north)
        than what was being asked about (west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        is based on the fact that the location isn't directly west, not because the
        locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this is a direct response to the comparison being evaluated, not

        clearly indicated a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning about the relative locations
        of the two mountains.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that Wildspitz is east of Zugerberg, indicating a difference
        in location. The NO is because they have different locations, not because
        they're in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        giving a direct comparative result based on relative locations (stating Wildspitz
        is east, not west, of Zugerberg)

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating Wildspitz is east of Zugerberg), not because the locations have equal
        positions. The model explicitly indicates a difference in position rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear directional reasoning (Wildspitz being east of Zugerberg,
        therefore not west)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (one is east of the other). The NO is given because the relationship
        is the opposite of what was presumably asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion (that Wildspitz is east, not west, of Zugerberg).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer - it
        believes Wildspitz is east of Zugerberg (based on Austria being east of Switzerland),
        which appears to be the opposite of what was being asked. The NO is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after laying out its reasoning steps.

        (Wildspitz being east of Zugerberg, not west), not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step reasoning
        process and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its comparative answer, determining
        that Wildspitz is east (not west) of Zugerberg.
