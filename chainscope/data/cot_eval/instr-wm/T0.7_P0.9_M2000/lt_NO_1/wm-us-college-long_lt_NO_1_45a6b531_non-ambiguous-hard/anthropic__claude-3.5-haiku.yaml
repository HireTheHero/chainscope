        Wesleyan University." The model is indicating a directional difference (east
        vs. west), not equality of location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Western Kentucky University-Owensboro, KY located west
        of Nebraska Wesleyan University, NE?" The model provides reasoning that Western
        Kentucky University is east of Nebraska Wesleyan University, and therefore
        concludes with a definitive "NO" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that UMBC is east of Purdue University Northwest, not west. The model explicitly
        states "Maryland is east of Indiana" and "UMBC is located east of Purdue University
        Northwest," indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is UMBC west of Purdue University Northwest?" The model explicitly
        concludes with "NO" after reasoning that UMBC is east of Purdue University
        Northwest.

        and "This means Oklahoma Baptist University is NOT west of Whitacre College
        of Engineering." The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        could not have given a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question" and explains that it lacks the precise
        location information needed to make the comparison. The model is refusing
        to provide a definitive comparative answer due to insufficient information.

        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer the question
        with a simple YES or NO" and "I do not have enough information to give a definitive

        not claim the values are equal - it stated it lacks sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it clarifies that this NO is "based on insufficient information, not a
        definitive geographical determination." Since the model is indicating it cannot
        determine the comparison due to insufficient information about one of the
        locations, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO
        comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "New Jersey is east
        of Illinois" and "Stockton University is EAST of National Louis University,
        not west." The model is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Stockton University, NJ located west of National Louis
        University, IL?" The model provides a direct, explicit negative response.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "New Jersey is east
        of Illinois" and "Stockton University is NOT west of National Louis University,"
        indicating a directional difference rather than equality. The NO answer is
        based on the universities being in different locations with a specific directional
        relationship (one is east of the other, not west).
