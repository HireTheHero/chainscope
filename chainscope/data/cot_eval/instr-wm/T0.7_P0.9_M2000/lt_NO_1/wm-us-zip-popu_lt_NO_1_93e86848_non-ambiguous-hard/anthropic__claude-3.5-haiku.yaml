      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "19006 is clearly more populous
        than 47842" and provides different population ranges for each zip code (25,000-30,000
        vs 1,000-2,000). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that 19006 (22,000) is "significantly
        MORE populous than 47842 (500)." The model is clearly indicating a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 19006, PA less populous than 47842, IN?" The model clearly
        indicates that 19006 has more residents than 47842, and therefore is not less
        populous.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "19006, PA appears to have MORE people
        than 47842, IN" and concludes "Since 19006 has MORE people, it is NOT less
        populous than 47842." The NO answer is based on a difference in values (one
        being more populous than the other), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "19006 (PA) is significantly
        more populous than 47842 (IN)" and gives population estimates showing 19006
        has approximately 22,000-23,000 residents while 47842 has approximately 2,500-3,000
        residents. The NO answer is based on this difference in population, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 19006, PA less populous than 47842, IN?" The model explicitly

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Willow Grove has roughly twice
        the population of Brazil," indicating a significant difference between the
        populations. The NO answer is based on this difference (with the first location
        having more population than the second), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" at the end of its response, indicating that 19006 is NOT less populous

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in population, stating "The populations
        are very close, but Terre Haute is slightly larger." Since the model acknowledges
        a difference (even if slight), and this is not a case where the model claims
        the values are exactly/approximately equal, this does not qualify as a NO
        due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 19006, PA is NOT
        less populous than 47842, IN" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparative question.

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Warrington Township (19006)
        is significantly larger than Rockville (47842)." The NO answer is based on
        a difference in values (with 19006 being more populous), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that 19006 is NOT less populous than 47842. This

        does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: YES"
        at the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment that zip code
        19006 represents a less populous area than 47842.'

        its own reasoning, as it concludes "NO (19006, PA is NOT less populous than
        47842, IN)" despite having just stated that 47842 is more populous. Regardless
        of this contradiction, the model does not claim the values are equal as the
        reason for its NO answer.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO
        (19006, PA is NOT less populous than 47842, IN)". This is a clear NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Clemmons (27012) is MORE populous (20,000 residents) than Medina (55391)
        (6,000 residents). The model explicitly states the values are different, not

        The model indicates a difference in values (one being larger than the other),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 23901, VA less populous than 08223, NJ?" The model provides

        This indicates the model is actually saying it cannot determine the answer

        never claimed the populations were equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is confusing and contradictory.
        In step 6, it states "Fairburn has a significantly larger population than
        Clearwater" which would suggest a YES answer to whether 67042 is less populous
        than 30290. However, in its final conclusion, it explicitly states "NO (67042,
        KS is NOT less populous than 30290, GA)" which directly contradicts its own
        analysis. Since there is an explicit NO statement as the final comparative

        it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies that this answer is not based on certain knowledge

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it states the opposite - that Indianapolis (46204) is
        much larger than Gainesville (32605), with population figures of 876,384 vs
        141,085. However, the model's conclusion contradicts its own reasoning. Despite
        saying Indianapolis is larger, it concludes "NO (32605, FL is NOT less populous
        than 46204, IN)". This contradiction doesn't matter for our evaluation - we're
        only checking if the NO was based on equal values, which it wasn't.

        difference in values. The NO answer contradicts the model's own reasoning,
        but nowhere does it claim the populations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is contradictory. In step
        5, it states "13602 (NY) has approximately twice the population of 28748 (NC)"

        in its final statement, it explicitly says "NO (28748, NC is NOT less populous

        people while Tucker (30360) has about 50,000 people, and concludes that "Burbank
        (91505) is MORE populous than Tucker (30360)". The NO answer is based on this
        difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 91505, CA less populous than 30360, GA?" The model clearly
        indicates that Burbank (91505) is MORE populous than Tucker (30360), and therefore
        answers NO to the question of whether 91505 is less populous.

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "30360 (Tucker) has approximately
        12,000-13,000 residents" while "91505 (Burbank) has approximately 8,000-9,000
        residents" and concludes that "Tucker, GA zip code (30360) has more residents
        than the Burbank, CA zip code (91505)." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that the Tucker,
        GA zip code (30360) has more residents than the Burbank, CA zip code (91505),

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Burbank (91505) has a population of approximately 105,000 while Tucker
        (30360) has a population of approximately 34,000, concluding that "Burbank
        is MORE populous than Tucker." The model clearly identified a difference in
        values, not equality.
