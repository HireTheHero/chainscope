        on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Charles Mix County
        is east of Whatcom County, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Charles Mix County, SD located west of Whatcom County,

        that Charles Mix County is east of Whatcom County, not west. The model explicitly
        states "Charles Mix County is east of Whatcom County" and "Charles Mix County
        is located EAST of Whatcom County, not west." This indicates a difference
        in values (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "Charles Mix
        County is located EAST of Whatcom County, not west" and therefore answers
        "NO" to what appears to be a question about whether Charles Mix County is
        west of Whatcom County.

        after working through the geographical positions of the two counties. The

        positions, stating that "New York is east of Texas" and "Chemung County, NY
        is further east than Kaufman County, TX." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It provides a clear comparative result after analyzing the geographic positions

        The model identified a directional difference (east vs. west) as the reason
        for its NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 5 of its reasoning. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative

        Maine (where Sagadahoc County is located) is "much further north and east"
