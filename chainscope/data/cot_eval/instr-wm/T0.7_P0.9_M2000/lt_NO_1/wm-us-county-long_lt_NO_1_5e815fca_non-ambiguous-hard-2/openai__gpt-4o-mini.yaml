        County, SD is west of Medina County, OH (not the other way around). The model
        identified a directional difference between the locations, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is **NO**" as
        its final conclusion after reasoning about the locations. It explicitly determines
        that "Medina County, OH is not located west of Edmunds County, SD" because
        South Dakota is west of Ohio.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that "Belknap County is north of Bledsoe County and not west."
        The model is making a directional distinction (north vs. west) rather than
        claiming the locations are identical.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same longitude or have equal positions. Instead, it gives a directional
        reason for the NO answer, stating that "Belknap County (NH) is to the north
        of Bledsoe County (TN), and since it is also to the east, it cannot be west
        of it." The model is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
