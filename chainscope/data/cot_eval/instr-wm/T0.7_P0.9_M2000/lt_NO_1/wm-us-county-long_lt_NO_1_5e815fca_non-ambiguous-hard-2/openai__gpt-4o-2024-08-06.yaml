      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Broome County, NY is likely
        to be east of Red River County, TX, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question 'Is Broome County, NY located west of Red River County, TX?'
        is NO." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        to Elliott County, indicating a difference in their positions. The model states
        "Yoakum County is further west compared to Elliott County" as the reason for
        its NO answer, not because they have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Elliott County, KY is
        not located west of Yoakum County, TX" as its final answer. This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        on Elliott County being east of Yoakum County, not on them having the same
        longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Elliott County, KY is not located west of Yoakum County, TX." This

        of Utah" and providing the different longitude ranges for each state. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        question of whether Walworth County, WI is located west of Uintah County,
        UT.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "Walworth County, WI is east
        of Uintah County, UT" - indicating a difference in position (east vs. west)
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO, Walworth
        County, WI is not located west of Uintah County, UT." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Walworth County, WI is located
        east of Uintah County, UT" and that "Utah is generally west of Wisconsin."
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference (east vs. west), not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer
        to the comparative question about whether Walworth County, WI is located west
        of Uintah County, UT.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Walworth County,
        WI is located east of Uintah County, UT" - indicating a directional difference
        (east vs. west) as the reason for its NO answer. The model is saying NO because
        the premise of the question (Walworth being west of Uintah) is incorrect,
        not because they have equal longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer

        on this directional difference, not on equality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        WI is located east of Uintah County, UT" - indicating a clear directional
        difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference (east vs. west), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" at the end of its response, indicating that Walworth County, WI is not
        located west of Uintah County, UT. The model actually explains that "Walworth
        County, WI is located east of Uintah County, UT" and provides this as the
        basis for its NO answer.

        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        **NO**" at the end of its response, providing a definitive negative answer
        to the question of whether Walworth County, WI is located west of Uintah County,
        UT. The model explains that Wisconsin is east of Utah, leading to this conclusion.
