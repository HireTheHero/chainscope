      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Portage County is in Ohio
        (eastern US) while Coleman County is in Texas (south-central US), and concludes
        that "Any county in Ohio will be east of any county in Texas." The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Portage County, OH
        is NOT located west of Coleman County, TX)" as its final answer. This is a
        clear NO response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "Portage County must be east
        of Coleman County" and "Since we established it's east, not west, the answer
        is clear." The model is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are the same. Instead, it stated that Coleman County, TX is west of Portage
        County, OH (not equal positions), and therefore Portage County cannot be west
        of Coleman County. The model identified a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after explaining that Portage County, OH cannot be west of Coleman County,
        TX because Coleman County is west of Portage County.

        County (i.e., they are in different positions), and therefore Wolfe County
        cannot be west of Archer County. The reason for the NO is that the locations
        have different positions, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Wolfe County,
        KY is not west of Archer County, TX after reasoning about their geographic
        locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Wolfe County is east of Archer
        County, not west. The reason for the NO is that the directional relationship
        is opposite to what was asked (east rather than west), not because the locations
        are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Wolfe County, KY

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Manassas Park City,
        VA is east of Ascension Parish, LA, not west of it, and therefore answered
        NO to what was presumably a question about whether Manassas Park City is west
        of Ascension Parish.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that Nebraska (where Gosper
        County is) is west of Georgia (where Lanier County is), and therefore Lanier
        County is east of Gosper County, not west. The model is noting a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clarifying that "Walworth County, WI is east of Uintah County, UT, not west
        of it." This is a clear negative response to the comparison question (which
        presumably asked if Walworth County is west of Uintah County).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model did not give a NO answer because the values\
        \ are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Walworth County is at around\
        \ 88.5\xB0W longitude while Uintah County is at around 109.5\xB0W longitude,\
        \ and concludes that Walworth is EAST of Uintah (not the same longitude).\
        \ The model notes a clear difference in values as the reason for its NO answer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. It concludes that Walworth County, WI is not west of Uintah
        County, UT after comparing their longitudes.
