      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Broome County is much further
        east" than Red River County, indicating a clear difference in their locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is therefore
        NO" at the end of its response, providing a definitive comparative answer
        to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2dbdb3e8-a7c2-4bac-b74b-e66b2ac52929:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Broome County, NY
        is located east of Red River County, TX, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The model says "Broome County, NY is located significantly
        to the northeast of Red River County, TX" and "No, it is located east."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Broome County, NY located west of Red River County, TX?"
        The model clearly indicates that Broome County is located east, not west,
        of Red River County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Broome County, NY
        is located east of Red River County, TX, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations. The reason for the NO answer is that "the opposite
        is true" - meaning one location is east of the other, not that they have the
        same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model concludes that Broome
        County, NY is not located west of Red River County, TX, but rather is located
        east of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values being compared\
        \ are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that the locations have different\
        \ longitudes (Broome County at ~-76\xB0 W and Red River County at ~-95\xB0\
        \ W) and concludes that Red River County is further west than Broome County.\
        \ The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Broome County, NY is located west of Red River County, TX. The
        model explicitly concludes that "Red River County is west of Broome County,
        Broome County is located east of Red River County" and then gives a definitive
        "NO" answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    7829eaa7-377f-4ec6-b429-c821b5331c01:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Broome County,
        NY has a more easterly longitude than Red River County, TX" and "Broome County,
        NY is east of Red River County, TX." The model is clearly indicating a difference
        in longitude between the two locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.

      result: 'NO'
    7847fe1d-74b0-47c5-8179-ef8fe845b4d1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Broome County,
        NY is significantly east of Red River County, TX" and bases its NO answer
        on this directional difference. The model is indicating a clear directional
        relationship (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Broome County, NY is west of Red River County, TX. This is an explicit
        comparative judgment where the model determined that the premise is false.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    94536ae8-e328-48ec-9706-57df4ffb1f06:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Broome County is
        east of Red River County" and concludes that "Broome County, NY is not located
        west of Red River County, TX." The NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (east vs. west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response, providing a direct answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    9863ffd0-2870-4d10-966c-eb41f9c6c5b0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that the locations have different
        longitudes (Broome County at roughly 76 degrees West and Red River County
        at roughly 95 degrees West). The model's NO answer is based on the fact that
        Broome County is east of Red River County, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. It concludes that Broome County, NY is not located
        west of Red River County, TX, but rather is located east of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e38bd39b-2a17-45d2-95bf-00acba082feb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Broome County, NY is east of
        Red River County, TX, indicating a directional difference. The model concludes
        "NO" because it found that Broome County is east (not west) of Red River County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response, providing a definitive comparative answer to the question.

    fa5d5048-01f3-428e-a077-d9fa5bb90add:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Broome County, NY is east of
        Red River County, TX (not west), indicating a directional difference. The
        model says "Since Texas is west of New York, any county in New York will be
        east of any county in Texas. Therefore, Broome County, NY is located east
        of Red River County, TX." This is the reason for the NO answer, not because
        the locations have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response, providing a definitive negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    397b7227-9d18-4bac-aec6-9ce2e7302647:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the counties are
        in different positions, with Elmore County being east of Petroleum County.
        The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Elmore County, AL is not located west of Petroleum County,
        MT. The model explains that Elmore County is actually east of Petroleum County
        based on the relative locations of Alabama and Montana.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    405af72b-6234-47d8-a62c-ab65a7de7a4c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Elmore County, AL
        is located east of Petroleum County, MT, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The reason for the NO answer is that the locations
        have different positions relative to each other (east vs. west), not that
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Elmore County, AL is west of Petroleum County,
        MT. The model explains that Elmore County, AL is located east of Petroleum
        County, MT, and therefore answers "NO" to the question asking if it is west.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    54678598-02f1-4a81-b0b1-ef58214130cd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Elmore County, AL is located
        east of Petroleum County, MT because Montana is much further west than Alabama.
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5aa69f12-e2d5-47c7-bfdb-20034974d23c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Elmore County, AL
        is east of Petroleum County, MT, indicating a directional difference. The
        reason for the NO answer is that Elmore County is east (not west) of Petroleum
        County, not because they are at the same location or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model clearly concludes that Elmore
        County, AL is not west of Petroleum County, MT, but rather east of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7548a5e2-654f-4ac5-849f-32d94128bd1e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Elmore County, AL is east of Petroleum County, MT (not west as the question
        asked). The model explicitly states "Montana is significantly further west
        than Alabama" and "any county in Alabama will be east of any county in Montana,"
        indicating a clear directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Elmore County, AL is located west of Petroleum
        County, MT. The model clearly concludes that since Montana is west of Alabama,
        Elmore County is east (not west) of Petroleum County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    799acfd3-9532-4ba3-b6ca-7f1a5af1b955:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Petroleum County,
        MT is located west of Elmore County, AL, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Elmore County, AL is west of Petroleum County,
        MT. The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after reasoning that Petroleum
        County, MT is west of Elmore County, AL (not the other way around).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a71365c2-b0d8-4f29-950f-777e87729f6e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in location,
        stating that "Montana is significantly further west than Alabama" and "Elmore
        County, AL is located east of Petroleum County, MT." The NO answer appears
        to be contradicting the reasoning provided rather than indicating equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No." as its final answer.
        This is a clear NO response to the question, indicating the comparison does
        not hold as stated. The model first explains that Elmore County, AL is located
        east of Petroleum County, MT (since Montana is west of Alabama), and then
        concludes with "No."
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a94584e8-547b-4f55-b6ab-c512cab83e7c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it actually concludes that "Elmore County,
        AL is located east of Petroleum County, MT" but then gives a "NO" answer,
        which appears contradictory. The model does not claim equality as the reason
        for its NO answer - in fact, it explicitly states a directional difference
        (east of).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model has provided a step-by-step reasoning process and concluded with a definitive
        "NO".

    af7e7f23-9495-445f-94fc-941a8de5cf8c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Elmore County, AL is located east of Petroleum County, MT" and that
        "Alabama is significantly east and south of Montana." The NO answer appears
        to be based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Rankin County, MS is located east of Yavapai County, AZ (not west as
        the question asked). The model explicitly states "Since it is located *east*,
        the answer is no." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Rankin County, MS is located west of Yavapai County,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Yavapai County,
        AZ is west of Rankin County, MS because Arizona is in the southwestern US
        while Mississippi is in the southeastern US. The model is indicating a difference
        in location (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that the longitudes are
        different (Rankin County at ~90-91 degrees West and Yavapai County at ~112-113
        degrees West) and concludes that Rankin County is east of Yavapai County,
        not west of it. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. It clearly indicates that Rankin County is not west of
        Yavapai County, but rather east of it.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines
        that Oceana County, MI is located east of Kearny County, KS (not west). The
        model explicitly states that Oceana County has a longitude of around 86 degrees
        West while Kearny County has a longitude of around 101 degrees West, and concludes
        that "Oceana County, MI is located east of Kearny County, KS" - indicating
        different values, not equal ones.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Elk County, PA is
        east of Bee County, TX (not west), indicating a directional difference. The
        model's reasoning is that "Pennsylvania is east of Texas" and therefore "Elk
        County, PA is east of Bee County, TX." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        east of Texas." The model's conclusion contradicts its final "NO" answer,
        but I'm only evaluating what was stated, not resolving contradictions. Since
        the model clearly indicates a directional difference (east) rather than equality,
        this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which appears to be a direct response to the comparative question. The model

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Texas is significantly
        further west than New Jersey" and concludes that "Milam County, TX is west
        of Somerset County, NJ." The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model concludes that "Somerset County, NJ is *not* located west of Milam County,
        TX" and then provides the final answer "NO".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined that Sandusky
        County, OH is located east of Williamson County, TX (not west of it). The
        model explicitly states "No, the eastern location is not west of the western
        location" - indicating a directional difference, not equality. The model's
        reasoning is based on Ohio being "generally located further east than Texas"
        and Texas being "further west than Ohio."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question
        of whether Sandusky County, OH is located west of Williamson County, TX.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Sandusky County, OH must be east of Williamson
        County, TX" and "No, it is located east of it." The model is indicating a
        clear directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Sandusky County, OH is located west of Williamson
        County, TX. The answer is explicitly stated in the final line of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the locations have different
        longitudes (Sandusky County at approximately 83 degrees West and Williamson
        County at approximately 97 degrees West). The model's reasoning for the NO
        answer is that Williamson County is west of Sandusky County, not that they
        are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is therefore
        NO" and concludes with "NO" at the end of its response. The model is making
        a definitive comparative judgment that Sandusky County, OH is NOT located
        west of Williamson County, TX.

        of Williamson County, TX. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is even emphasized with "$\boxed{NO}$" at the end. The model is making
        a comparative judgment that Sandusky County, OH is not west of Williamson
        County, TX (rather, it concludes that Sandusky County is east of Williamson
        County).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Screven County,
        GA is east of Woodson County, KS, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference (east
        vs. west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Since Screven County,
        GA is east of Woodson County, KS, it is not west of it" and then provides
        a clear "NO" at the end.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Screven County,
        GA is located further east than Woodson County, KS, indicating a clear directional
        difference between their locations. The model gives the NO answer because
        Screven County is east of (not west of) Woodson County, not because they are
        at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Screven County, GA is not located west of Woodson County,
        KS. The model provides a direct and explicit negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Screven County, GA is east of Woodson County, KS (not west). The model
        explicitly states "Screven County, GA is east of Woodson County, KS. Therefore,
        it is not west of it." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model was asked if Screven County, GA is
        west of Woodson County, KS, and it explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"

        "Georgia is located significantly east of Kansas" and concluded that "Screven
        County, GA is located east of Woodson County, KS." The model clearly identified
        a directional difference between the locations, not equality. The "NO" answer
        appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but nowhere does it claim
        the locations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. However, this appears to contradict the model's
        own reasoning, as it concluded in step 5 that "Screven County, GA is located
        east of Woodson County, KS." Despite this contradiction, I must evaluate based
        on what was explicitly stated as the final answer, which was "NO".

        MA is east of Champaign County, IL, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The reason for the NO answer is that Plymouth County is east
        of (not west of) Champaign County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model explicitly concludes "NO, Massachusetts

        that Plymouth County, MA is east of Champaign County, IL, not west. The model
        explicitly states "Plymouth County, MA is located east of Champaign County,
        IL" and concludes "Since Plymouth County, MA is east of Champaign County,
        IL, it is not west of it." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Plymouth County, MA
        is east of Champaign County, IL (not west), and therefore answered "NO" to

        that the locations have different positions, with Portage County, OH being
        east of Coleman County, TX (not west). The model explicitly states "Texas
        is significantly further west than Ohio" and concludes that "Portage County,
        OH is located east of Coleman County, TX." This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to what appears to be
        a question about whether Portage County, OH is west of Coleman County, TX.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Portage County,
        OH is located east of Coleman County, TX" in its reasoning, indicating a difference
        in location. The "NO" answer contradicts the model's own reasoning, but I'm
        evaluating only what was stated, not logical consistency. Since the model
        does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer, this is False.

        Texas." The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on directional difference
        (Coleman County is west of Portage County), not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Portage County, OH

        County, SD is actually east of Granite County, MT." The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Deuel County, SD is located west of Granite County,

        "Eastern South Dakota is significantly east of western Montana" and concludes
        that "Deuel County, SD is located east of Granite County, MT." The model indicates
        a clear difference in location, not equality, so the NO answer was not based
        on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which appears to be its final answer to the comparative question.
        However, this NO contradicts the model's reasoning, which concluded "Deuel
        County, SD is located east of Granite County, MT." This inconsistency doesn't
        change the fact that the model's final explicit answer was NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that Knox County, TN is at approximately
        84 degrees West longitude while Brookings County, SD is at approximately 96
        degrees West longitude. The model concludes NO because Knox County is east
        of (not west of) Brookings County, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion, indicating that Knox County, TN is not located west of
        Brookings County, SD. The answer is explicitly stated at the end of the response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating "Since Knox County is southeast of Brookings County, it is not west
        of Brookings County." The model is indicating a specific directional difference
        (southeast vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The final answer is $\boxed{NO}$"
        at the end of its response, providing a definitive NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Knox County, TN
        is east of Brookings County, SD" and that "east TN is much further east than
        east SD." The model is clearly indicating a difference in longitude between
        the two locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Knox County, TN is
        east of Brookings County, SD" and explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have
        different positions, with Brookings County being west of Knox County (and
        Knox County being east of Brookings County). The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Knox County, TN is located west of Brookings County,
        SD. The model explains that since South Dakota is west of Tennessee, Brookings
        County is west of Knox County, making Knox County east of Brookings County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Knox County, TN is at approximately
        84.5 degrees West while Brookings County, SD is at approximately 96.8 degrees
        West. The model's reason for saying NO is that Knox County is east of Brookings
        County (not west as the question asked), not because they have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Knox County, TN is located west of Brookings County,
        SD. The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its step-by-step reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Wetzel County, WV is east of Caddo Parish, LA (not west as the question
        asked). The model explicitly states "Wetzel County, WV is east of Caddo Parish,
        LA" and explains the longitude differences, indicating the locations are in
        different positions, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Wetzel County, WV is west of Caddo Parish, LA.
        The model explains that Wetzel County is actually east of Caddo Parish, not
        west, and provides this as a direct comparative result.

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that Wetzel County is at approximately
        80-81 degrees West longitude while Caddo Parish is at approximately 93-94
        degrees West longitude. The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Wetzel
        County is east of (not west of) Caddo Parish, not because they have the same
        longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Wetzel County is west of Caddo Parish. The model
        explains that Wetzel County is at a more easterly longitude than Caddo Parish,
        and therefore concludes with a definitive "NO" answer.

        "West Virginia is generally east of Louisiana" and concludes that "Wetzel
        County, WV is located east of Caddo Parish, LA". The model is indicating a
        directional difference, not equality, as the basis for its answer. The "NO"
        appears to contradict its own reasoning, but nowhere does it claim the locations
        are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
        The model actually states "Since West Virginia is east of Louisiana, Wetzel
        County, WV is located east of Caddo Parish, LA" and then says "NO", which
        appears to be contradictory, but I'm evaluating only the final explicit answer

        - it concludes that "Galax City, VA is east of Nueces County, TX" which shows
        the locations have different positions. The model's reasoning actually contradicts
        its final "NO" answer, but we're instructed to focus only on what was explicitly
        stated, not resolve contradictions. Since the model does not claim equality
        as the reason for its NO answer, this is False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "Sauk County is east of Uinta County" (not
        west, as the question asked). This is a clear directional difference, not
        an equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Uinta County, WY is west
        of Sauk County, WI (not equal). The model states "Wyoming is located in the
        Mountain West region" and "States in the Mountain West (like Wyoming) are
        significantly further west than states in the Midwest (like Wisconsin)." The
        NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are different
        - specifically that "Sauk County, WI is located east of Uinta County, WY"
        and that "Wisconsin is geographically east of Wyoming." The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Sauk County, WI is west of Uinta County, WY. The
        model explicitly concludes that Sauk County is east of Uinta County, not west,
        and therefore answers "NO" to the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the locations have different positions - specifically that Sauk County
        is east of Uinta County, not west as the question asked. The model explicitly
        states "Sauk County, WI is located east of Uinta County, WY" indicating a
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response, providing a direct answer to the comparative question.

        at around 90 degrees West). The model's NO answer is based on the fact that
        Cache County is further west than Mississippi County, not that they have equal
        longitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Mississippi County, AR is located west of Cache County, UT. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines
        that Bristol County, MA is located east of Worth County, GA (not west as the
        question asks). The model explicitly states "Bristol County, MA is located
        east of Worth County, GA" and compares their different longitude values (-70/-71
        vs -84).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes with "**YES / NO Answer:** Based on the reasoning, the statement

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Frontier County being west of Bladen County and Bladen County
        being east of Frontier County. The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Bladen County, NC located west of Frontier County, NE?".
        The model explains that Frontier County is west of Bladen County (not the
        other way around), so Bladen County is east of Frontier County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Nebraska is substantially
        west of North Carolina" and "Frontier County, NE is located west of Bladen
        County, NC." The model's NO answer is based on the directional difference
        between the locations (one being east of the other), not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. The model directly answers the comparative
        question with a definitive NO, indicating that Bladen County, NC is not west
        of Frontier County, NE.

        NE is west of Bladen County, NC" and "Bladen County, NC is located east of
        Frontier County, NE." The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (east vs. west), not on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response, providing a direct and explicit negative answer to the
        question "Is Bladen County, NC located west of Frontier County, NE?"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (longitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Frontier County, NE" is further
        west than "Bladen County, NC" by saying "any location in Nebraska will be
        significantly further west than any location in North Carolina" and "Bladen
        County, NC is located east of Frontier County, NE." The NO answer is based
        on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Bladen County, NC is not further west than Frontier
        County, NE. The model clearly provides a negative comparative answer.

    d27b2649-6862-47df-bef8-d8173cda93fe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes a significant difference in longitude
        (78-79 degrees West for Bladen County vs. 100-101 degrees West for Frontier
        County) and concludes that "Frontier County, NE is significantly west of Bladen
        County, NC." The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after concluding that Bladen County, NC is located east of Frontier County,
        NE (not west of it).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or suggest that the values
        being compared (the locations of Bladen County, NC and Frontier County, NE)
        are equal or the same. In fact, the model's reasoning explicitly states that
        "North Carolina is significantly east of Nebraska" and concludes that "Bladen
        County, NC is east of Frontier County, NE." The model gives NO as its final
        answer but does not base this on equality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which directly contradicts its own reasoning. The model's step-by-step reasoning
        concludes that "Bladen County, NC is east of Frontier County, NE" but then
        gives "NO" as the final answer. Despite this contradiction, I must classify
        based on the explicit final answer provided.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Bladen County,
        NC is east of Frontier County, NE" and therefore "it is not west of Frontier
        County, NE." The NO answer is based on directional difference (east vs. west),
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response, providing a definitive comparative answer to the question
        about whether Bladen County, NC is west of Frontier County, NE.

        West longitude while Wasatch County, UT is at 111-112 degrees West longitude.
        The model concludes that Ray County is east of Wasatch County (not the same
        location), which is why it answers NO to the question about Ray County being
        west of Wasatch County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Ray County, MO is east of
        Wasatch County, UT because Utah is west of Missouri. The NO answer is based
        on directional difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Ray County, MO is not west of Wasatch County, UT.

        located east of Wasatch County, UT, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations. The reason for the NO answer is that Ray County
        is east (not west) of Wasatch County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Ray County, MO is west of Wasatch County, UT. The
        model explains that Ray County is actually east of Wasatch County, and therefore
        answers NO to the question asking if Ray County is west of Wasatch County.

        of Wasatch County ("Ray County is clearly *east* of Wasatch County"), indicating
        a directional difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The response concludes with "Therefore, Ray County, MO is *not* located west

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (longitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have different
        longitudes - "New Jersey is on the East Coast of the US, which has a more
        easterly longitude" while "Nebraska is in the Midwest, which has a more westerly
        longitude." The model says NO because Mercer County is east of Sarpy County,
        not because they have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Mercer County, NJ is west of Sarpy County, NE. The model explicitly
        concludes with "NO" after reasoning that "Since New Jersey is east of Nebraska,
        Mercer County is located East of Sarpy County."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Archer County, TX
        is west of Wolfe County, KY, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the two locations. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that the relationship
        is the opposite of what was asked (Archer County is west of Wolfe County,
        not Wolfe County west of Archer County).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that the longitudes are different
        (83.2 degrees West for Wolfe County vs 98.6 degrees West for Archer County)
        and concludes that Archer County is further west than Wolfe County. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" and concludes with "NO" at the end of its response. The model is directly

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Wolfe County, KY is located west of Archer County, TX. The model
        explains that Texas is west of Kentucky, so Archer County (in Texas) must
        be west of Wolfe County (in Kentucky), meaning Wolfe County is not west of
        Archer County.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Schoharie County is east of Dubuque County (not west as the question
        asked). The model explicitly states "Schoharie County is east of Dubuque County"
        and notes different longitude values (-74.4 vs -90.7), indicating they are
        not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Schoharie County is west of Dubuque County. The model explicitly

        model is saying NO because the locations have different positions (one is
        east of the other), not because they have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        OK. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Indiana County, PA is located west of Coal County,
        OK. The model explains that Coal County, OK is west of Indiana County, PA,
        and therefore Indiana County, PA is east of Coal County, OK, leading to the
        NO answer.

        is significantly further east in longitude than southeastern Louisiana" and
        "Virginia is generally east of Louisiana." The model's reasoning actually
        indicates a difference in values, not equality, despite its contradictory
        "NO" answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which directly contradicts its own conclusion that "Manassas Park City, VA
        is east of Ascension Parish, LA." Despite this contradiction, I must take
        the explicit "NO" at face value as the model's final answer.

        model is giving NO as an answer because it believes the locations have different
        positions (east vs. west), not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Manassas Park City, VA located west of Ascension Parish,

        to the northeast" of East Baton Rouge Parish, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The model's reasoning is based on the locations
        being in different positions (northeast vs southeast), not that they are equal
        or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model concluded that "Sagadahoc County,
        ME is located far to the northeast of East Baton Rouge Parish, LA. Therefore,
        it is not located west of it." This is a definitive NO answer to what appears
        to be a question about whether Sagadahoc County is west of East Baton Rouge
        Parish.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Lenoir County, NC is east of Pratt County, KS, not west of it. The model
        explicitly states "Kansas is significantly further west than North Carolina"
        and "Lenoir County, NC is east of Pratt County, KS," indicating a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. The model determined that Lenoir County,
        NC is east of Pratt County, KS (not west of it), and therefore answered "NO"

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference (east vs. west), not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after reasoning that Belknap County is east of Bledsoe County, not west as
        the question asked.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (longitudes)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Belknap County, NH is in
        the northeastern US while Bledsoe County, TN is in the southeastern US, and
        concludes that "Belknap County, NH is generally east of Bledsoe County, TN."
        The NO answer is based on directional difference (east vs. west), not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question
        about whether Belknap County, NH is further west than Bledsoe County, TN.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e559f60e-e703-4a54-bf14-fe13863ab928:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Belknap County, NH is located
        east of Bledsoe County, TN ("No, it's located east"). The model's reasoning
        is that New Hampshire is "much further east than Tennessee" and that "Belknap
        County, NH, will be east of any county in Tennessee, including Bledsoe County."
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Belknap County, NH located west of Bledsoe County, TN?"
        The answer is clear and direct.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Belknap County is
        east of Bledsoe County, indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference (east vs.
        west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Since Belknap County
        is east of Bledsoe County, it is not west of it" and ends with a definitive
        "NO".
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Walworth County is east of Uintah County"
        and therefore "it is not west of Uintah County." The model is indicating a
        directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Walworth County, WI is west of Uintah County, UT.
        The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Walworth County,
        WI is east of Uintah County, UT, indicating a directional difference. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference (east vs. west), not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" and reiterates "NO" at the end of its response. The model directly answers
        the comparative question with a definitive NO, indicating that Walworth County,
        WI is not west of Uintah County, UT (but rather east of it).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    17c721d2-15dc-400b-8c2b-9be6a5223521:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Walworth County, WI is east
        of Uintah County, UT (not west as the question asked). The model clearly indicates
        a directional difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" and reaffirms
        this in its final step-by-step reasoning with "Since Walworth County, WI is
        east of Uintah County, UT, the answer to the question is NO." The model has
        provided a definitive comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    2bc9cdd2-2e0a-4653-8fff-8359f592fc20:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that the locations
        have different longitudes (-88 degrees vs -109 degrees) and concluded that
        "Uintah County, UT is west of Walworth County, WI" and "Walworth County, WI
        is located east of Uintah County, UT." The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to what appears to be
        a question about whether Walworth County, WI is west of Uintah County, UT.
        The model concluded that Uintah County, UT is west of Walworth County, WI
        (not the other way around).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Walworth County,
        WI is located east of Uintah County, UT, indicating a directional difference.
        The reason for the NO answer is that the locations are in different directions
        (east vs. west), not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Walworth County, WI is located west of Uintah County,
        UT. The model clearly concludes that Walworth County is east (not west) of
        Uintah County.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it concluded that
        Walworth County is east of Uintah County, not west. The model identified a
        directional difference (east vs. west), not equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response, providing a direct answer to the comparative question.
        The model determined that Walworth County, WI is east of Uintah County, UT
        (not west as the question asked), and therefore answered NO to the question
        of whether Walworth County is west of Uintah County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
