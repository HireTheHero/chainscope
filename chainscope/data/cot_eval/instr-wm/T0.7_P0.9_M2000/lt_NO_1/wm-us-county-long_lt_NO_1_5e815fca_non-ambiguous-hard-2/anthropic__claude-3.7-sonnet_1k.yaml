        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Botetourt County is in Virginia
        (east) while Todd County is in Minnesota (west), indicating a clear directional
        difference between their locations. The model states "Since Minnesota is entirely
        west of Virginia on a map of the United States, any county in Minnesota (including
        Todd County) would be west of any county in Virginia (including Botetourt
        County)." This shows the NO answer is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.

        UT. This is a direct and explicit answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    df6e839d-3bec-40ae-86f1-e901a7fedc74:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Walworth County
        is east of Uintah County, indicating a directional difference. The reason
        for the NO answer is that the premise of the question (Walworth being west)
        is incorrect because Walworth is actually east of Uintah.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Walworth County, WI
        is not located west of Uintah County, UT. It is located east of it." This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
