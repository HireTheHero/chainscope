        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Broome County is
        EAST of Red River County, not west of it. The model is indicating a directional
        difference (east vs. west), not equality. The reason for the NO answer is
        that the locations have different positions relative to each other, not that
        they are equal or identical.

        is east of Cavalier County, indicating a directional difference. The model's
        reasoning is that "Michigan is entirely east of North Dakota in terms of longitude"
        and therefore Cheboygan County cannot be west of Cavalier County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Cheboygan County, MI is located west of Cavalier County, ND. The
        answer is explicitly stated at the end of the response.

        not that they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Laclede
        County, MO is not located west of Ravalli County, MT." This is a definitive

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Franklin
        City, VA is east of Jasper County, MO, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations. The model states "Franklin City, VA is not west
        of Jasper County, MO. It is east of it." This shows the model is noting a
        difference in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Franklin City, VA is west of Jasper County, MO. The answer is explicitly

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Franklin City, VA
        is east of Jasper County, MO, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The reason for the NO answer is that Franklin City is east
        (not west) of Jasper County, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. It directly answers the question of whether Franklin City,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that
        the locations are different, with South Dakota being west of Alabama, and
        therefore Haakon County being west of Cullman County. The NO answer is based

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Cullman County, AL located west of Haakon County, SD?"
        The model explains that South Dakota is west of Alabama, and therefore Haakon
        County is west of Cullman County, not the other way around.

        compared are equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that Cullman County
        is east of Haakon County, indicating a directional difference rather than
        equality. The model is stating there is a clear directional relationship (east
        vs. west) between the counties.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly saying "Cullman County, AL is NOT located west of Haakon County,

        the directional relationship is opposite to what was asked (east rather than
        west), not because the locations have equal longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Walworth County
        is east of Uintah County, not west of it. The model gives a directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The response explicitly says "# Answer: NO" at the end, indicating that Walworth
        County, WI is NOT located west of Uintah County, UT.'

        \ longitudes (Walworth County at approximately 88.5\xB0W and Uintah County\

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Walworth County, WI
        is NOT located west of Uintah County, UT." at the end of its response. This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: "The model did not give a NO answer because the values\

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly says "Therefore, Walworth County, WI is located EAST of Uintah
        County, UT, not west of it" and concludes with "NO" at the end of its response.

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly says "Answer: NO" and then clarifies "Walworth County, WI is

    fa37a3a0-67b3-46c4-98c3-2ddd80d58fad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Uintah County (in Utah) is
        west of Walworth County (in Wisconsin), indicating a clear directional difference
        between their locations. The model specifically notes that "Utah has a higher
        western longitude value than Wisconsin," showing the values are different,
        not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Walworth County, WI is not located west of Uintah
        County, UT. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
