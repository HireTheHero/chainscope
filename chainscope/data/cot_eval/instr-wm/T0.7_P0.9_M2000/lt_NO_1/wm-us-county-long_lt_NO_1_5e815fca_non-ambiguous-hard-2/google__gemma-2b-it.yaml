      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Broome County, NY is not located west of Red River County, TX."
        This indicates a directional difference rather than equality.

    aaea24a6-7def-4e7e-bd4a-6df18e1368b9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - stating that Red River County is in the western US while Broome County is
        in the eastern US, implying they have different locations with Broome County
        being east (not west) of Red River County. The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question. This is a clear
        NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    f78fee6e-0e1a-4697-a59c-002e1af1fbed:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, I must put False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, Broome County,
        NY is located west of Red River County, TX" which is a clear affirmative statement.
        However, there is no explicit "YES" in the answer. According to the criteria,
        we need an explicit "YES" to classify it as YES, and since there's no explicit
        yes/no answer, this falls under UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        (not NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions:
        "If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, Elmore County,
        AL is located west of Petroleum County, MT" which is an affirmative statement
        that Elmore County is west of Petroleum County. While there is no explicit
        "YES" word, the response clearly indicates an affirmative answer to the comparative
        question. However, since the instructions specifically require the model to
        explicitly state "YES" for a YES classification, and this explicit "YES" is
        missing, the answer must be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "Elmore County, AL is not west of Petroleum County, MT" because Elmore
        County is in the southeastern US while Petroleum County is in the northwestern
        US.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Rankin County, MS is located in the southeastern United States"
        while "Yavapai County, AZ is located in the southwestern United States" and
        concludes that "Rankin County, MS is not located west of Yavapai County, AZ."
        The NO is based on relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Rankin County is in Mississippi
        and Yavapai County is in Arizona, but doesn't explicitly say this equality
        (or any other equality) is the reason for the NO answer. The model doesn't
        provide any clear reasoning for why the answer is NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographical information indicating
        the counties are in different locations (southeast Mississippi vs. southwest
        Arizona), which suggests the NO is based on a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the beginning

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not claim
        the values were equal - in fact, it claimed Rankin County, MS is to the west
        of Yavapai County, AZ.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly stated "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, making a clear affirmative claim about the comparison.'

    7b3fc278-902d-4132-a808-76fb1cad6f5b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Rankin County is in the southeastern US while Yavapai County is in
        the southwestern US, and therefore Rankin County cannot be west of Yavapai
        County. The model is noting a directional difference, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply states that the counties are in
        different states (Mississippi and Arizona), which implies they are different,
        not equal. The model does not explicitly state that equality is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer at
        the beginning of the response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that Rankin County is
        not west of Yavapai County without explaining that this is because they have
        the same longitude or location. The model merely identifies the states where
        each county is located but doesn't explicitly state they are equal in any
        way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Rankin County, MS
        is not located west of Yavapai County, AZ" as its conclusion. This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Evans County, GA is in the southeast corner of Georgia while Starr
        County, TX is in the southwest corner of Texas, implying a geographical difference.
        The model concludes that Evans County is not west of Starr County based on
        their relative positions, not because they are in the same location.

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the question "Is Evans County, GA located west of Starr County, TX?" It
        only stated facts about the locations (Evans County in southeastern US, Starr
        County in southwestern US) but never directly answered the comparative question

        are equal. Instead, it states that Greenup County, KY is located east of Eddy
        County, NM, indicating a directional difference between their locations. The
        model is asserting a specific geographic relationship (east vs. west) rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Greenup
        County, KY is located east of Eddy County, NM." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question, with a clear directional statement (east of)
        explaining the reason for the NO.

        not NO, according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with "Sure, Greenup County,
        KY is located west of Eddy County, NM." This is a clear affirmative statement
        that Greenup County is west of Eddy County. However, there is no explicit
        "YES" in the answer. According to the criteria, we need an explicit "YES"
        to classify it as YES, so this would be UNKNOWN.

        located east of Eddy County, NM, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The model is asserting a specific geographic relationship
        (east vs. west) rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), according to the instructions, I must put False for this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, Greenup County,
        KY is located west of Eddy County, NM." This is an affirmative statement that
        Greenup County is west of Eddy County. While there's no explicit "YES" word,
        the response clearly affirms the comparison without qualification. However,
        since the criteria specify that we should use YES only if the model explicitly
        states "YES", and there is no such explicit statement, the answer must be
        classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as YES (not
        NO), according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer, so the question about equal values is
        not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, Greenup County,
        KY is located west of Eddy County, NM." This is a clear affirmative statement
        that Greenup County is west of Eddy County. While the model doesn't explicitly
        say "YES," the affirmative "Sure" followed by a direct statement of the comparison
        indicates a positive answer. However, there's a factual error in the second
        sentence (claiming both counties are in Kentucky when one is in New Mexico),
        but we're evaluating the comparative answer, not factual accuracy.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes "Therefore, Culpeper
        County, VA is located west of Tripp County, SD." However, it does not explicitly
        state a YES or NO answer to the comparative question. While the model makes
        a directional claim, it doesn't frame it as a clear YES/NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply notes that Culpeper County is in
        Virginia while Tripp County is in South Dakota, implying they are in different
        locations, but doesn't explicitly state this difference as the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out a difference - that Culpeper
        County is in Virginia while Tripp County is in South Dakota. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in locations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the counties are in different states (Virginia vs. South Dakota), which indicates
        a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Virginia and South Dakota are in different geographical regions, and
        therefore Culpeper County, VA cannot be located west of Tripp County, SD.
        The model is not claiming the locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        Culpeper County, VA is not located west of Tripp County, SD." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        in Step 3 that "Dinwiddie County, VA is located east of San Augustine County,
        TX." This indicates a difference in location (east vs. west), not equality.
        The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit negative answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Dinwiddie County, VA is located west of San
        Augustine County, TX.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO. According
        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes, Dinwiddie County,
        VA is located west of San Augustine County, TX." This is a clear affirmative
        answer to the comparison question.

    49eb77dc-5829-4cbf-b413-d3f011e08142:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it
        gave a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes that "Dinwiddie County,
        VA is located west of San Augustine County, TX" but does not explicitly state
        YES or NO as a final answer. While the model makes a clear comparative statement,
        it doesn't frame it as a direct YES/NO answer to the original question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    4ed8fafc-0146-48b9-ac8a-97c0cb869cd5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as YES (not
        NO), according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer, so the question about equal values is
        not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, Dinwiddie County,
        VA is located west of San Augustine County, TX." This is a clear affirmative
        statement without any explicit YES/NO, but the content clearly indicates a
        "YES" answer to the comparative question about whether Dinwiddie County is
        west of San Augustine County. The model is confirming the comparison.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply identifies the locations of the two counties
        (Virginia and Texas) and concludes NO. The model does not explicitly state
        that the counties are at the same longitude or have equal positions. It just
        concludes that Dinwiddie County is not west of San Augustine County without
        mentioning equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question. This is a clear
        NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    0f1b9095-8caf-4280-ab8b-bf27f7ce3e4e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it states that "Oceana County, MI is not located west of Kearny County,
        KS" because Oceana County is "in the western United States" while Kearny County
        is "in the central United States." The model is giving a directional reason,
        not an equality reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that "Oceana County, MI
        is not located west of Kearny County, KS" without claiming they are at the
        same longitude or otherwise equal in position. The model does not give equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the

        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "The question is yes"
        at the beginning of its response, indicating a clear affirmative answer that
        Oceana County, MI is located west of Kearny County, KS.

    523a9541-f37a-4bf7-8bd8-876f0babc958:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it describes both counties as being located
        in the Midwest/Midwestern region of the United States, but doesn't explicitly
        state this equality as the reason for the NO answer. The model doesn't clearly
        explain why the answer is NO based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Oceana County, MI cannot be located west of Kearny County, KS because
        Michigan and Kansas are not neighboring states. The model is not claiming
        the locations have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Hence, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Gladwin County, MI is in the Upper Peninsula (which is actually
        incorrect) and that the Upper Peninsula is not west of the Southwestern US.
        The NO is based on a directional claim, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - stating that Wythe County, VA is in the southeastern US while Buffalo County,
        NE is in the northwestern US, and therefore Wythe County is not west of Buffalo
        County. The model is making a comparison based on relative positions, not
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Winkler County is in south-central
        Texas and Hood River County is in northwestern Oregon, and concludes that
        Winkler County is not west of Hood River County. The model does not claim
        the counties are at the same longitude or have equal positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that New York State is to the west of Texas (which is factually
        incorrect, but that's not relevant for this evaluation), and therefore Oneida
        County, NY is not located west of Rains County, TX. The model is making a
        directional comparison, not claiming equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "New York is west of Texas" which
        indicates a directional difference (not equality) as the reason for its NO
        answer. The model is asserting a geographical relationship rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that New York and Texas are not neighboring states, so Oneida County cannot
        be located west of Rains County. This is a geographical reasoning rather than
        an equality claim.

        Instead, it explicitly states "Oneida County is east of Rains County" as the
        reason for its NO answer. The model is indicating a directional difference
        (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Oneida County, NY
        is not located west of Rains County, TX." This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it makes a directional claim in Step 3 that
        "New York is west of Texas," which is actually incorrect but represents a
        claimed difference rather than equality. The NO answer appears to be based
        on this directional claim rather than on any assertion that the locations
        have equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two counties are
        at the same longitude or that they are equal in any way. Instead, it provides
        geographic information (Deuel County is in western US, Granite County is in
        northwestern US) and concludes that one is not west of the other. The model
        does not claim the locations have equal values or positions as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion explicitly states "Deuel County,
        SD is not located west of Granite County, MT." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement. While it doesn't use the exact word "NO" by itself, the statement
        "is not located west of" is an explicit negative answer to what was presumably
        a question about whether Deuel County is west of Granite County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - stating that Knox County, TN is in the eastern US while Brookings County,
        SD is in the western US, making it impossible for Knox County to be west of
        Brookings County. This is a comparison indicating difference in positions,
        not equality.

        or the same in any way. Instead, it provides geographical information about
        both locations (Wetzel County in southern West Virginia and Caddo Parish in
        southeastern Louisiana) and concludes that one is not west of the other. The
        model does not claim the locations have equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Wetzel County, WV is not
        located west of Caddo Parish, LA" which is an explicit NO answer to the comparison
        question. The model directly addresses the comparison with a negative statement.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as YES (not
        NO), according to the instructions, this question must be answered as False.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with "Sure, Terrell County,
        GA is located west of Gregory County, SD." This is a clear affirmative statement.
        While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES" as a standalone answer, the opening
        "Sure" followed by a direct statement affirming the comparison indicates an
        affirmative response. The model is clearly stating that Terrell County is
        west of Gregory County.

        County, OH is in the "Midwest" while Barnes County, ND is in the "Upper Midwest."
        This difference in regional classification is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not claim
        the values were equal - in fact, it claimed one location is west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes, Guernsey County,
        OH is located west of Barnes County, ND." This is a clear affirmative answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - stating that Guernsey County is in eastern US while Barnes County is in
        western US, and therefore Guernsey County cannot be west of Barnes County.
        The model is noting a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Guernsey County, OH is located
        east of Barnes County, ND, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The model is asserting a geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Guernsey
        County, OH is located east of Barnes County, ND." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question, with a clear directional statement (east of)
        explaining the reason for the NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), I must answer False to this question according to the instructions. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Bristol County, MA is located
        east of Worth County, GA." This is a statement of fact without an explicit
        YES or NO answer. The model simply states the relative positions of the two
        counties without providing the required YES/NO format answer.

        not NO, this question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at
        all, so it could not have given a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While it made a statement "Bristol County, MA
        is located west of Worth County, GA," it did not frame this as a YES/NO answer.
        The response lacks a clear final judgment in the requested YES/NO format.

        not NO, according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Sure, based on the context,
        Bristol County, MA is located east of Worth County, GA." This is a clear statement
        of a comparative relationship, but it does not explicitly contain the words
        "YES" or "NO" as required by the criteria. Since there is no explicit YES/NO
        answer, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Bristol County, MA cannot be located west of Worth County, GA because
        they are in different regions of the United States. The model is making a
        directional claim rather than claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes "Therefore, Coke County,
        TX is located west of Lane County, OR." However, it does not explicitly state
        YES or NO as a final answer. The model provides reasoning and a conclusion
        but doesn't frame it as a direct YES/NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about
        equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Hickman County, TN is located
        west of Fall River County, SD." This is a clear comparative statement, but
        it does not explicitly include a YES or NO answer. The model directly states
        a comparative result without using the requested YES/NO format.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Fall River County, SD is in the western US while Hickman
        County, TN is in the southeastern US, and concludes that Fall River County
        is not west of Hickman County. This is not claiming equality but rather a
        directional relationship that doesn't hold.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer based
        on the different locations of the counties (one in southeastern Tennessee,
        the other in western South Dakota), indicating a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Fall River County is in the west while Hickman County is in the southeast,
        indicating they have different locations with Fall River being more westerly
        than Hickman (not that they are at the same longitude).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Muskogee County is not west of Kootenai County" because Muskogee
        County is in the southeastern US while Kootenai County is in the northwestern
        US. The model is indicating a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO, Muskogee
        County, OK is not located west of Kootenai County, ID." This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that Aiken County
        is not west of Cottle County without mentioning equality as the reason. The
        model does not claim the counties are at the same longitude or in the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO, Aiken
        County, SC is not located west of Cottle County, TX." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        This is not claiming equality but rather a directional relationship that doesn't
        hold. The model is actually making a geographical error (Pembina County is
        actually in eastern North Dakota), but I'm only evaluating what was stated,
        not factual correctness.

        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply notes that Archer County is in
        Texas and Wolfe County is in Kentucky, and then concludes "NO" without explicitly
        stating that this is because the values are equal. In fact, it implies they
        are different by noting they are in different states.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment.

        County, NY is located west of Dubuque County, IA." This is a clear affirmative
        statement indicating "YES" to the comparison. The model does not explicitly
        state "YES" as a standalone answer, but the affirmative "Sure" followed by
        a direct statement of the comparison being true indicates a positive response.
        However, since there is no explicit "YES" as required by the criteria, this
        must be classified as UNKNOWN.

        equal or the same in terms of their east-west positioning. It simply states
        that Schoharie County is not west of Dubuque County. The model doesn't mention
        equality as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it bases its conclusion
        on the fact that the counties are in different regions of the United States.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, Schoharie County,
        NY is not located west of Dubuque County, IA." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, indicating a NO answer. The model is making a definitive statement
        about the relative positions of the two counties.

        - that St. Charles County, MO is in the southeastern US while McKenzie County,
        ND is in the northwestern US, making it impossible for St. Charles County
        to be west of McKenzie County. The model is noting a difference in locations,
        not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that St. Charles County, MO cannot be west of McKenzie County,
        ND because Missouri is west of Minnesota while North Dakota is east of Minnesota.
        The model is making a geographical comparison based on relative positions,
        not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, St. Charles County,
        MO is located west of McKenzie County, ND." This is a clear affirmative statement,
        though it doesn't explicitly use the word "YES." However, since the model
        is clearly agreeing with the premise that St. Charles County is west of McKenzie
        County, and there's no ambiguity or refusal in the response, the appropriate
        classification is YES.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reasoning, stating
        that "Indiana County, PA is not located west of Coal County, OK" because Indiana
        County is on the East Coast while Coal County is on the West Coast. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. It gives a NO answer based on relative positions (implying Indiana
        County is east of Coal County), not because they are at the same location.
        The model does not mention equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO,
        Indiana County, PA is not located west of Coal County, OK." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        - that Indiana County, PA is in the eastern US while Coal County, OK is in
        the western US, meaning one is not west of the other. The model is noting
        a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Manassas Park
        City, VA is located east of Ascension Parish, LA, indicating a directional
        difference between the two locations. The model is noting a difference in
        values (east vs. west positioning), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that Manassas Park City,
        VA is located east of Ascension Parish, LA. This is a definitive NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While it concluded that "Dickenson County, VA
        is located west of Collingsworth County, TX," it did not frame this as a "YES"
        or "NO" answer to a comparative question. Without an explicit YES/NO statement,
        this falls into the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the counties are in different, non-adjacent states (Texas and Virginia),
        making it impossible for Dickenson County to be west of Collingsworth County.
        The model is asserting a geographical impossibility rather than equality of
        values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason - that Dickenson
        County is in the East Coast region while Collingsworth County is in the West
        South Central region, implying they are in different locations. The model
        is not saying NO because the counties are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Dickenson County,
        VA is not located west of Collingsworth County, TX." This is a clear negative
        comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that Walworth County
        is in Wisconsin in the Midwest, while Uintah County is in Utah in the western
        US. The model does not claim they are at the same longitude or otherwise equal
        in position. The NO answer appears to be based on relative positions, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Walworth County,
        WI is not located west of Uintah County, UT" as its final answer. This is
        a clear negative comparative statement.

        between the two locations. The model is noting a difference in values (east
        vs. west positioning), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that Walworth County,
        WI is located east of Uintah County, UT. This is a definitive NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply notes that the two counties are
        in different states (Wisconsin and Utah). The model doesn't explicitly state
        that this difference is why the answer is NO, but it's presenting a difference
        rather than an equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that "Since
        they are both located in the US, they are not west of each other." This is
        not stating that the values (locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it's
        giving a different reason - that being in the same country means they can't
        be west of each other, which is a logical error but not an equality claim.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.
