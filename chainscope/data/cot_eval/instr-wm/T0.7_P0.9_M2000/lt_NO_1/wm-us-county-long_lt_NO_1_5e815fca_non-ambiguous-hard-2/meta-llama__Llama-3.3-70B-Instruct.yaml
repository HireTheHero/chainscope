      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Broome County, NY is east
        of Red River County, TX (not west of it), indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The model states "New York (and thus Broome County)
        is east of Texas (and thus Red River County)" as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Broome County, NY is east
        of Red River County, TX (not west), indicating a directional difference rather
        than equality. The NO answer is based on the locations being in opposite directions,
        not because they are the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes "NO" because it determines that
        Broome County is east of Red River County, not west of it. The model states
        "Given that Broome County, NY, is east of Red River County, TX, it cannot
        be west of Red River County, TX." This indicates a directional difference,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Broome County is east of
        Red River County, indicating a difference in their longitudinal positions.
        The model states "New York is east of Texas" and concludes that "any county
        in New York, including Broome County, would be east of any county in Texas,
        including Red River County." This shows the model is noting a directional
        difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Alabama is east of Montana, not west of it. The model concludes that
        "Elmore County, AL is not west of Petroleum County, MT" because of their relative
        positions, not because they have equal longitudes.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Elmore County, AL is east
        of Petroleum County, MT (stating "Elmore County, AL, being in the southeast,
        would be east of Petroleum County, MT, which is in the northwest"). The NO
        answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on these steps,
        the answer to whether Elmore County, AL, is located west of Petroleum County,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        explaining that Elmore County, AL is southeast of Petroleum County, MT, not
        west of it. The model is saying NO because the directional relationship is
        different than what was asked (southeast vs. west), not because the locations
        are equal or identical.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        North Carolina (where Catawba County is) is east of North Dakota (where Pembina
        County is), meaning Catawba County cannot be west of Pembina County. The model
        is making a directional comparison and finding them to be in opposite positions

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Belknap County, NH is actually
        east of Bledsoe County, TN (not west), indicating a directional difference
        rather than equality. The model states "Since New Hampshire is to the east
        of Tennessee, Belknap County, NH cannot be west of Bledsoe County, TN. It
        is actually the other way around; Bledsoe County, TN is west of Belknap County,
        NH."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Belknap County
        is actually east of Bledsoe County, not west," indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Walworth County, WI is east
        of Uintah County, UT (not west), indicating a directional difference as the
        reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Utah is west of Wisconsin" and therefore "any county in Utah,
        including Uintah County, is west of any county in Wisconsin, including Walworth
        County." The model is indicating a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Walworth County, WI is located west of Uintah County, UT. The answer
        is clearly stated at the end of the response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Walworth County is east of
        Uintah County ("it follows that Walworth County, WI, is east of Uintah County,
        UT, because the entirety of Wisconsin lies east of Utah"). The NO answer is
        based on directional difference (east vs. west), not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer to whether Walworth
        County, WI, is located west of Uintah County, UT, is **NO**." This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly gives a directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer, stating "Wisconsin is to the east of Utah"
        and "Walworth County, WI is east of Uintah County, UT, it cannot be west of
        Uintah County, UT." The NO is based on the counties being in opposite directions,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: **NO**"
        as its final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question about whether Walworth County is west of Uintah County.'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Walworth County, WI would be east of Uintah
        County, UT, not west." The model is indicating a specific directional relationship
        (east vs. west) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: **NO**" as its final answer to the comparative question about whether
        Walworth County, WI is located west of Uintah County, UT.'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Walworth County is east of
        Uintah County, not west of it. The model states "Wisconsin is in the eastern
        part of the US compared to Utah" and concludes that Walworth County would
        be east of Uintah County. The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Walworth County, WI is located west of Uintah County, UT. The answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Walworth County is not west
        of Uintah County because Wisconsin is located in the northeastern part of
        the United States while Utah is in the western part, meaning Wisconsin is
        east of Utah. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" at the
        end of its response, indicating that Walworth County, WI is not located west

        for the NO answer, stating "Wisconsin is to the east of Utah" and therefore
        "Walworth County would be east of any county in Utah." The model is saying
        NO because the locations have different positions, not because they're equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Walworth County, WI is located west of Uintah County, UT. The answer
        is clearly stated at the end of the response.
