    06dcffc1-0cb1-40f6-a1de-bff094c647f1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about the geographical
        locations, noting that Texas is "farther to the west than New York" and concludes
        with NO. The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    119a80fe-d0bf-4d98-98dc-44d7a5c20bb8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "it's not possible for a county
        in one state to be west of a county in another" which is giving a different
        reason for the NO answer - a rejection of the possibility of comparison rather
        than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about geographical locations,
        stating that New York is east of Texas and that counties in different states
        are unlikely to be west of each other. The NO answer is based on geographical
        positioning, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "New York and Texas are in
        different states, and the states are generally further apart" and concludes
        that "Broome County is not west of Red River County." The NO answer is based
        on directional reasoning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether Broome County is west of Red River
        County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Broome County, NY is not west
        of Red River County, TX" because they are in different states. The model is
        making a directional claim (not west of) rather than claiming the locations
        have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the question of whether Broome County is
        west of Red River County.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "New York is far to the east of Texas" and therefore
        "Broome County, NY is not west of Red River County, TX." The model is indicating
        a difference in location (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the question of whether Broome County, NY
        is west of Red River County, TX.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that there is a "vast distance between New York and Texas" and that New
        York is on the east coast while Texas is on the west coast (though this geographical
        claim is incorrect). The model is claiming a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion to the question of whether Broome County, NY is west of Red River
        County, TX.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        explaining that "New York is in the Northeast region and Texas is in the South
        region, Broome County, NY is not west of Red River County, TX." This indicates
        a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Broome County, NY is not west of Red River County, TX based on their
        relative positions in the United States. The model does not claim the counties
        are at the same longitude or in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion to whether Broome County, NY is west of Red River County, TX.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Elmore County (in Alabama/southeastern US) is not located west of Petroleum
        County (in Montana/northwestern US). The model is indicating a difference
        in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Elmore County, Alabama is
        not west of Petroleum County, Montana" because they are "in different geographical
        regions." The model is making a directional comparison and concluding that
        one is not west of the other, not that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether Elmore County, Alabama is west of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Elmore County is not west
        of Petroleum County because Alabama is in the southeastern US while Montana
        is in the northwestern US, implying they are in different locations with Montana
        being west of Alabama (not equal positions).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion to whether Elmore County is west of Petroleum
        County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Elmore County is in Alabama
        (southeastern US) while Petroleum County is in Montana (northwestern US),
        implying a geographical difference. The model concludes that Elmore County
        is not west of Petroleum County, but doesn't claim this is because they are
        in the same location or have equal coordinates.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Evans County, GA is not west of Starr County, TX because they are in
        different states. The model does not claim the counties have the same longitude
        or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        explaining that Arkansas is in the South and Montana is in the North, implying
        a geographical difference rather than equality. The model does not claim the
        counties are at the same longitude or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether Little River County, Arkansas is
        west of Yellowstone County, Montana.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the reasoning that
        the counties are in different states that are far apart, making it unlikely
        for one county to be west of another. The model is not claiming equality as
        the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are "on different sides of the country" with Tennessee
        in the Southeast and South Dakota in the Northern Plains, making it impossible
        for Hickman County, TN to be west of Fall River County, SD.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it notes that the two counties
        are in different states (Tennessee and South Dakota) and in different regions
        of the United States (Southeastern vs. Northern Plains). The NO answer is
        based on this difference in location, not on equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Fall River County, South Dakota, is not west of Hickman County,
        Tennessee" because of their relative positions (South Dakota being in the
        Great Plains region and Tennessee being in the Midwestern region). The model
        is actually incorrect in its geographical reasoning (South Dakota is generally
        west of Tennessee), but that doesn't affect our classification.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the question of whether Fall River County,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating "Since Florida is west of Iowa, St. Lucie County, Florida cannot be
        west of Sac County, Iowa." The model is claiming one location is not west
        of the other, not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether St. Lucie County is west of Sac
        County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that St. Lucie County is in Florida
        and Sac County is in Iowa, and that Iowa is further west than Florida. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" at the end of its response, indicating that St. Lucie County is not west
        of Sac County.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Florida and Iowa are located
        in different parts of the US, and therefore, they are not in the same direction"
        and concludes that "St. Lucie County, FL is not located west of Sac County,
        IA." The reason for the NO answer is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after reasoning about the locations of St.
        Lucie County, FL and Sac County, IA.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that St. Lucie County is not west
        of Sac County because Florida is in the southeastern US while Iowa is in the
        Midwest. The NO answer is based on geographical positioning, not equality
        of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Vermilion Parish is not west
        of Bernalillo County because New Mexico (where Bernalillo County is located)
        is in the southwestern part of the US while Louisiana (where Vermilion Parish
        is located) is in the southeastern part. The NO answer is based on geographical
        positioning, not equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer,
        stating "Bernalillo County, NM is not west of Vermilion Parish, LA" based
        on the geographical locations of Louisiana and New Mexico. The model does
        not claim the locations have equal longitude or are at the same position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Vermilion Parish cannot be west of Bernalillo County because Louisiana
        is not west of New Mexico. This is a directional difference, not an equality
        statement.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Vermilion Parish is in the Southern region while Bernalillo County
        is in the Southwest region, and that they are "on opposite sides of the country."
        The model is claiming a directional difference, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Sagadahoc County (Maine) cannot be west of East Baton Rouge Parish
        (Louisiana) based on their geographical positions. The model is making a directional
        claim about their relative positions rather than claiming they are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that the counties are in different
        states (Maine and Louisiana), but doesn't explicitly state that this equality
        is the reason for the NO answer. In fact, noting they are in different states
        suggests inequality rather than equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        explaining that Texas is in the Southern region while Washington is in the
        Pacific Northwest region, implying they have different positions. The model
        is indicating that Runnels County is not west of Spokane County because of
        their relative positions, not because they are at the same longitude.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lenoir County is in the Southeastern
        region while Pratt County is in the Midwestern region, and based on this regional
        difference, concludes that Lenoir County is not west of Pratt County. The
        NO answer is based on relative geographical positions, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment that

        is NO" as its final conclusion after reasoning about the locations of the
        counties.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b3b9ae48-288a-4f18-bc09-4f92229e5f9a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that "Wisconsin is in the Midwest
        and Utah is in the Western region of the United States" as the basis for its
        NO answer, indicating a difference in regions rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d495da50-e055-47df-805b-31c56c395768:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Walworth County, Wisconsin
        is not west of Uintah County, Utah" and bases its NO answer on the fact that
        the counties are in different parts of the United States. It does not claim
        they have equal longitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d96bbaf8-2f31-49bd-b9a8-5363e6f95146:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Wisconsin is in the eastern
        part of the US while Utah is in the western part, indicating a difference
        in location as the reason for the NO answer. The model is saying NO because
        one is east and one is west, not because they're in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment that
        Walworth County, Wisconsin is not west of Uintah County, Utah.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f6ee0641-f5ad-4629-be48-b0c2bcc886ce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Walworth County is not west
        of Uintah County because Wisconsin is in the Midwestern region while Utah
        is in the Mountain region. The model is indicating a directional difference
        (not equality) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" at the end of its response, providing a direct and explicit negative answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fd06899e-584f-43e5-ac5b-0509cd0c42d9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        explaining that Wisconsin is in the Upper Midwest while Utah is in the Western
        United States, implying that Walworth County is east (not west) of Uintah
        County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after reasoning about the locations of Walworth
        County and Uintah County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
