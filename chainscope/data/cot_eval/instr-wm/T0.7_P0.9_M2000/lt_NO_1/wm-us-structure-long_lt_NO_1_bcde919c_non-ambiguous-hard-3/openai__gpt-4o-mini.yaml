      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Asheville is east of Nashville" and therefore "the Cathedral
        of All Souls cannot be west of the Nashville Municipal Auditorium." The model
        is claiming one location is east of the other, not that they are at the same
        longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on the reasoning
        above, the answer is **NO**" at the end of its response. This is a clear NO

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        Asheville is east of Nashville, which means the Cathedral cannot be west of
        the Nashville Municipal Auditorium. This is a directional difference, not
        an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is NO"
        as its final conclusion after reasoning about the geographical locations of
        the two places.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Asheville is approximately
        east of Nashville" and "Since Asheville is east of Nashville, it is not west
        of Nashville." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (east vs.
        west), not on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Asheville lies to the east of Nashville" and "Since
        Asheville is east of Nashville, it cannot be said that the Cathedral of All
        Souls is located west of the Nashville Municipal Auditorium." The model is
        claiming the locations have different positions, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment that the
        Cathedral of All Souls is not located west of the Nashville Municipal Auditorium.

    fe26b0a1-2995-448d-97fd-3cdd184a33bb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Connecticut (where Durfee Hall
        is) is northeast of Pennsylvania (where Genetti Hotel is), indicating a directional
        difference. The NO answer is based on this directional relationship (northeast
        vs. west), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.
