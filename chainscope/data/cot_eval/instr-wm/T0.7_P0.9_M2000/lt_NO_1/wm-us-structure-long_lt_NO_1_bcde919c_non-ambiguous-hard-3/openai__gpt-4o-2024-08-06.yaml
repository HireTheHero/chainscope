      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Sterling Memorial
        Library in New Haven, Connecticut, is east of Mississinewa Lake Dam in Indiana"
        - indicating a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        **NO**, Sterling Memorial Library is not located west of Mississinewa Lake
        Dam." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

    ae1446f6-f1ea-4516-bf24-10bc134afe5b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the locations have different relative positions - specifically that Sterling
        Memorial Library is east of Mississinewa Lake Dam (not west, as the question
        asked). The model explicitly states that "Indiana is to the west of Connecticut"
        and that the library is "located east of" the dam, indicating a directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: **NO**"
        at the end of its response, providing a direct negative answer to the question
        of whether Sterling Memorial Library is located west of Mississinewa Lake
        Dam. The model explains that Connecticut is on the eastern side of the US
        while Indiana is in the Midwest, and specifically states "Indiana is to the
        west of Connecticut" and "Sterling Memorial Library, CT is located east of
        Mississinewa Lake Dam, IN."'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "the Cathedral of
        All Souls in Asheville, NC, is indeed located east of the Nashville Municipal
        Auditorium, TN" - indicating a directional difference (east vs. west) as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        question of whether the Cathedral of All Souls is located west of the Nashville
        Municipal Auditorium.

        of values.

        the locations have different relative positions - specifically stating "Oklahoma
        City is generally east of Santa Fe" and "the Civic Center Music Hall is located
        east of the Lensic Theater." The model is indicating a directional difference
        (east vs. west), not equality.

        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in the longitudes (74 degrees west
        vs. 78 degrees west) and concludes that 120 Wall Street is east of East Branch
        Clarion River Lake because 74 is smaller than 78. The NO answer is based on
        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "El Vado Lake, NM is east of
        Lake Yosemite, CA" which indicates a difference in position (east vs. west).
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is NO. El Vado Lake, NM is not located west of Lake Yosemite,
        CA." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "the Arnold Engineering
        Development Complex is located east of the Tulsa Performing Arts Center" -
        indicating a directional difference (east vs. west) as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question about whether the Arnold Engineering Development Complex
        is west of the Tulsa Performing Arts Center.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the courthouse is
        located east of Lake Springfield, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response, indicating that the H. Carl Moultrie Courthouse is not
        located west of Lake Springfield, IL. The model explains that the courthouse
        is actually east of Lake Springfield.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the courthouse is located
        east of Lake Springfield (not west), indicating a directional difference.
        The model's reasoning is that Washington D.C. is on the east coast while Springfield,
        Illinois is centrally located, making their positions different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer to the question is: **NO**." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question about whether the H. Carl Moultrie Courthouse is west of Lake Springfield.'

        difference (east vs. west) as the reason for the NO answer. The model is noting
        a difference in locations, not equality.

        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in longitude (New Haven at approximately
        72.9 degrees west longitude and Williamsport at approximately 77.0 degrees
        west longitude) and states that "New Haven is east of Williamsport" as the
        reason for its NO answer.
