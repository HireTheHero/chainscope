      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that Sterling Memorial
        Library is east of Mississinewa Lake Dam, indicating they are at different
        locations. The model notes that "Connecticut is on the East Coast" while "Indiana
        is in the Midwest, significantly to the west of Connecticut." This shows a
        clear difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Sterling Memorial Library, CT located west of Mississinewa
        Lake Dam, IN?" The model clearly concludes that Sterling Memorial Library
        is east of Mississinewa Lake Dam, not west of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly indicates a difference in position,
        stating that "Connecticut is on the East Coast" while "Indiana is in the Midwest,
        significantly to the west of Connecticut" and concludes that "Sterling Memorial
        Library, CT is located east of Mississinewa Lake Dam, IN." The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (longitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Sterling Memorial Library is
        east of Mississinewa Lake Dam, indicating a difference in longitude. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Sterling Memorial Library is located west of Mississinewa Lake
        Dam. The model explains that Sterling Memorial Library is east of Mississinewa
        Lake Dam, and therefore answers "NO" to the question asking if it's located
        west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Wellmont Theater is in New
        Jersey (East Coast) while LaDue Reservoir is in Ohio (Midwest), and concludes
        that Ohio is west of New Jersey. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is
        that "East is not west of West" - indicating a directional difference, not
        equality.

        Lake is west of Tellico Reservoir (or equivalently, Tellico Reservoir is east
        of Nimrod Lake). The model did not state or imply that the locations are at
        the same longitude or have equal positions.

        In fact, it explicitly notes that the longitudes are different (-74.0 degrees
        West for Basic Creek Reservoir vs -87.6 degrees West for Chicago Avenue Pumping
        Station) and concludes that Basic Creek Reservoir is east of Chicago Avenue
        Pumping Station, not west. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.

        Station is east of Exchequer Dam, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference (east
        vs. west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Navajo Generating Station, AZ is located west of New Exchequer
        Dam, CA. The model concludes that "Navajo Generating Station, AZ is not located
        west of New Exchequer Dam, CA" and then gives a clear "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the guidelines.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because one of the locations is fictional.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model also explains that "New Exchequer Dam, CA" does not exist,
        making a geographical comparison impossible. Since the model is rejecting
        the premise of the question (stating one location doesn't exist), this falls
        under the UNKNOWN category according to the guidelines.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        The model is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on the values being
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the

        Lovewell Reservoir is east of Rockport Reservoir, not west of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Lovewell Reservoir, KS located west of Rockport Reservoir,

        the locations have different relative positions - specifically that the Cyclorama
        Building is east of the Muskingum River Power Plant, not west as the question
        asked. The model explicitly states "the Cyclorama Building is east of the
        Muskingum River Power Plant" which indicates a directional difference, not

        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that the Cyclorama Building

        is to the east of Ohio" and "the Cyclorama Building in Gettysburg, PA will
        be east of the Muskingum River Power Plant in Ohio." The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.

        (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "the Cyclorama

        is east of Lewis and Clark Lake, not west. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Theatre Building Chicago, IL is located west of

        the answer is "NO". The model is indicating a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Beacon Reservoir is west of Skokie Lagoons. The
        model clearly concludes that Beacon Reservoir is east of Skokie Lagoons, not
        west, and therefore answers "NO" to the original question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Schenectady, NY
        is significantly to the east of the Allegheny Reservoir" and concludes that
        Proctor's Theatre is NOT located west of Allegheny Reservoir. The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that "Schenectady is clearly
        east of the Allegheny Reservoir," indicating a difference in location. The
        NO answer appears to be rejecting some unstated premise about the relative
        positions of these locations, not claiming they are equal or the same.

        Allegheny Reservoir. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.

        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that Proctor's Theatre is "significantly
        to the east" of the Allegheny Reservoir, not that they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
