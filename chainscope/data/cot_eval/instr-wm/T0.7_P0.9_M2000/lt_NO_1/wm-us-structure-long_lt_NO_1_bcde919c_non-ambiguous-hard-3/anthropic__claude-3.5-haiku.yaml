        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lake Icaria is west of Meander
        Creek Reservoir, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Meander Creek Reservoir is
        NOT west of Lake Icaria because "Ohio is east of Iowa" and "any point in Ohio

        that Meander Creek Reservoir is east of Lake Icaria, not west. The model explicitly
        states "Since it is actually east, not west, the answer is NO." This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Meander Creek Reservoir is east of Lake Icaria, not west. The model explicitly
        states "Northeastern Ohio is east of southwestern Iowa" and "This means Meander
        Creek Reservoir is east of Lake Icaria." The model is indicating a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Meander Creek Reservoir west of Lake Icaria?" The model

        Creek Reservoir (the opposite of what was asked), which is why the answer
        is NO. The model explicitly notes their different geographic positions, stating
        they are "quite far apart" with Lake Icaria in western Iowa and Meander Creek
        Reservoir in eastern Ohio.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice at the end of

        on a directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        of Lake Icaria (not west). The model is rejecting the comparison based on
        a directional difference, not based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        to the question "Is Civic Center Music Hall, OK located west of Lensic Theater,
        NM?" The model provides reasoning that Oklahoma is east of New Mexico, not
        west, and therefore concludes with a definitive "NO" answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Sun-Ray Cinema is west of Saint Anthony Cathedral Basilica. The

        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO is the answer" as its
        final conclusion to the comparative question. The model determined that Sun-Ray
        Cinema is east of Saint Anthony Cathedral Basilica, not west, and therefore
        answered NO to the question of whether Sun-Ray Cinema is west of Saint Anthony
        Cathedral Basilica.

        positions relative to each other (east vs. west), not that they are equal
        or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that Edison Theatre is east

        for its NO answer, stating "Gibson Generating Station is west of Mountaineer
        Wind Energy Center" and therefore the original statement is false. The model
        is claiming the locations have different positions, not equal ones.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it states that Mountaineer
        Wind Energy Center is east of Gibson Generating Station, not west. This indicates
        a difference in values (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Mountaineer Wind Energy Center is west of Gibson Generating Station.
        The model explains that Mountaineer Wind Energy Center is actually east of
        Gibson Generating Station, not west.

        Lake is east of (not west of) Hillsdale Lake, not because they are at the

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Tenth Presbyterian Church is east of The Emerson Theater, not west. The
        model explicitly states "Since it is actually east, not west, the answer is
        NO." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Philadelphia is

        The Emerson Theater." The NO answer is given because one location is east
        of the other, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Since the question asks
        if Tenth Presbyterian Church is west of The Emerson Theater, the answer is

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

        is east of Indiana (where The Emerson Theater is), the church is east of the
        theater, not west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Pennsylvania is
        west of Connecticut, and therefore Genetti Hotel is west of Durfee Hall, not
        the other way around. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" at the
        end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9d8fd285-cd4e-4981-96be-ca2cdb2fe2eb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Durfee Hall is east
        of Genetti Hotel, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Durfee Hall, CT located west of Genetti Hotel, PA?" The
        model provides reasoning that Durfee Hall is in Connecticut which is east
        of Pennsylvania where Genetti Hotel is located, and therefore Durfee Hall
        is east (not west) of Genetti Hotel.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason for its
        NO answer, stating that "Connecticut is east of Pennsylvania" and "Durfee
        Hall is EAST of the Genetti Hotel, not west." The model is rejecting the premise
        that Durfee Hall is west of Genetti Hotel because it believes the opposite
        directional relationship is true.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Durfee Hall, CT located west of Genetti Hotel, PA?"
      final_answer: 'NO'
