      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Heron Lake is east of Don Pedro Reservoir, not west as the question asked.
        The model explicitly states that "Heron Lake must be east of Don Pedro Reservoir"
        and concludes that this is the opposite of what the question asked (if Heron
        Lake is west of Don Pedro Reservoir).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Heron Lake is west of Don Pedro Reservoir. The

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the lakes are in
        different positions, with Sutton Lake being east of Pomme de Terre Lake. The
        reason for the NO answer is that Sutton Lake is east of (not west of) Pomme
        de Terre Lake, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        which directly answers the implied question of whether Sutton Lake is west
        of Pomme de Terre Lake. The model concludes "Therefore, Sutton Lake is NOT
        west of Pomme de Terre Lake" followed by "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Central Christian Church
        is east of Santa Margarita Lake because Nevada is east of California. The
        NO answer is based on a directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which directly answers the comparative question. The model also
        states "Central Christian Church (Henderson, Nevada) is NOT west of Santa
        Margarita Lake, CA." This is a clear negative answer to the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the locations have different relative positions - specifically that Lake
        Mohawk is east of Old National Centre, not west as the question asked. The
        model explicitly states "Lake Mohawk must be east of Old National Centre"
        which indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lake Mohawk is west of Old National Centre. The
        model determined that Lake Mohawk is in Ohio, which is east of Indiana where
        Old National Centre is located, so it concluded "NO" to the question asking
        if Lake Mohawk is west of Old National Centre.
