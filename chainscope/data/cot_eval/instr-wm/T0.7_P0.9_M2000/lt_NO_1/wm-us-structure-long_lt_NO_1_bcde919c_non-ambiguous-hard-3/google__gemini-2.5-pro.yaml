      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly explains that the locations are
        different, with Sterling Memorial Library being east of Mississinewa Lake
        Dam (not west). The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Sterling Memorial Library is to the west of Mississinewa
        Lake Dam. The answer is clear and definitive.

        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Sterling Memorial Library
        is east of Mississinewa Lake Dam, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations. The reason for the NO answer is that the library
        is east of the dam, not west of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that Sterling Memorial Library is east of Mississinewa
        Lake Dam, not west of it, and therefore answers "NO" to the original comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Meander Creek Reservoir
        is east of Lake Icaria, not west. The model's reasoning is based on the geographical
        relationship (Ohio being east of Iowa) rather than any equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        Ohio is entirely east of Iowa, meaning Meander Creek Reservoir must be east
        (not west) of Lake Icaria. The model is noting a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        The NO answer appears to be a direct response to the original question (which

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly explains that the locations have different
        positions, with Oklahoma being west of Tennessee and the Tulsa Performing
        Arts Center being west of the Arnold Engineering Development Complex. The
        model says NO because the relationship is the opposite of what was asked (the
        complex is east, not west, of the center).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after explaining that the Arnold Engineering Development Complex
        in Tennessee is east of the Tulsa Performing Arts Center in Oklahoma, not
        west as the question asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that the locations are
        different, with Oklahoma being west of Tennessee. The model states "Oklahoma
        is located to the west of Tennessee" and concludes that "any location in Tennessee,
        including the Arnold Engineering Development Complex, is east of any location
        in Oklahoma, including the Tulsa Performing Arts Center." This difference
        in location is the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        The model gives a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that the H. Carl
        Moultrie Courthouse is east of Lake Springfield, not west of it, and therefore
        answers "NO" to the question of whether the courthouse is west of the lake.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        in different positions, with Washington D.C. being to the east of Illinois.
        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that the courthouse is east of
        the lake, not west as asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly explains that the locations are
        different, with Pennsylvania being west of Connecticut, and therefore Durfee
