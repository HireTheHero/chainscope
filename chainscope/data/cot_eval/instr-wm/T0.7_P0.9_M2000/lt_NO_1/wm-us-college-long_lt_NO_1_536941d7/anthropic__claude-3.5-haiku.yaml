    5b1cda0a-c21d-4ade-95f9-c96d882dba23:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that University of the Sciences is east of
        Saint Joseph's University. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations.'

    7df29ada-4cd4-49a6-934a-31a6743f4c01:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (one east, one west), not because they are equal.
        The model explicitly states that University of the Sciences is east of Saint
        Joseph's University, indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on relative positions (stating
        one is east of the other, not west)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that University of
        the Sciences is east of Saint Joseph's University, indicating a clear directional
        difference between their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on the spatial relationship
        between the two locations (finding that one is east of the other, therefore
        not west).

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the coordinates and determining that University
        of the Sciences is east of Saint Joseph's University.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is east of the other, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states "University of the Sciences is east of Saint Joseph's University" and
        uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (east vs west) for
        this conclusion.

    b3f67154-6f23-4e10-b7bf-7419e60f6091:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Rather, the model explicitly states that
        Saint Joseph's University is west of University of the Sciences, indicating
        a difference in location. The NO is based on one being more west than the
        other, not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing a direct response to the directional comparison. The NO
        is based on finding that Saint Joseph's University is west of University of
        the Sciences, not the other way around.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b5958d5a-ed3c-47f8-b2c4-7b02c2d7eea9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that University of the Sciences is east of Saint Joseph's University, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion of its step-by-step analysis and once as a final
        standalone answer. The model makes a definitive comparative statement that
        University of the Sciences is east of Saint Joseph's University, not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is east of the other ("University of the Sciences is actually east
        of Saint Joseph's University"), not because the locations are equal or the
        same. It clearly indicates a directional difference.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both universities are in
        the same city and "very close to each other," it explicitly states that Gonzaga
        University is located east of WSU's Spokane campus. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on the locations being equal/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative result, indicating that Gonzaga University is
        NOT west of WSU''s Spokane campus.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Gonzaga
        is east of WSU, not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference ("Gonzaga University is actually
        EAST of Washington State University's Spokane campus").

    e8c44500-ead4-4f3c-8a87-19994d45477d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Gonzaga University is slightly
        east of the WSU Spokane campus." This indicates a difference in location,
        even if slight, rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether Gonzaga University is west of WSU Spokane. The
        answer is definitive and comparative, not indicating uncertainty or refusing
        to answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equal values (which wasn't present in this response anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine the relative positions
        due to insufficient information about one location. This matches the UNKNOWN
        criteria where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" due to lacking information about one location.
        The model refuses to make a comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        claimed the locations were equal - it simply couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I DO NOT KNOW" and explains
        it cannot determine the relative positions because it lacks information about
        one location. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states one location is east of the
        other, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on the
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model clearly concludes with \"NO\" and explicitly\

        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply couldn't determine their
        relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" because it cannot determine the location of

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because it cannot verify the locations to make the comparison
        ("I cannot verify the specific geographic relationship"). This makes it a

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states that "Denton (TWU) is north/northwest
        of Arlington" and concludes TWU is "NOT west" of Arlington Baptist College.
        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, with "NO" being stated twice for emphasis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Ohio is "north
        and east of Florida" and concludes that Muskingum is "NOT west of" Hodges.
        The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, and this NO is given as a direct comparative answer
        to whether Muskingum University is west of Hodges University.

        (Ohio being "north and east of Florida"), not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly notes a difference in position rather
        than equality.

        the locations were equal/same/identical - it only stated they were in the
        same town but couldn't determine relative positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and when forced to give a YES/NO answer, says "NO (because

        - explicitly stating they are in the same location, which is the primary reason
        given for why one cannot be west of the other. This is a case of equal values

        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on its geographic
        analysis concluding that Concordia is east (not west) of Phillips.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False. The model never compared equal values - it
        stated it couldn't make the comparison at all because one location couldn't
        be found.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot determine this"
        and "I cannot confidently answer YES or NO." It indicates it cannot make the
        comparison because one of the locations cannot be definitively found.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        The model explicitly states that Concordia is east of Phillips, indicating
        a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        provide a YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot verify the comparison
        because one location (Phillips University) cannot be found. This falls under
        the UNKNOWN criteria as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states one location is
        east of the other, indicating a directional difference. The NO was due to
        the opposite direction being true, not due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the model determined that one location was actually east of the other ("Winchester,
        KY is further east than Americus, GA"), indicating a difference in position
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't confirm the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine the relationship due to
        limited information. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison.

        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because the
        School of Public Health was determined to be north (not west) of the College
        of Pharmacy. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (north vs. south) between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains this is because the institutions don't appear
        to be real. The model rejects the premises of the question by stating these
        universities don't exist, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a REFUSED
        response.

        the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE" and
        explains it cannot verify the locations because it cannot confirm these are
        real institutions. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot answer this with geographic
        certainty..." and rejects the premises by noting both universities are non-existent.
        When a model says NO but indicates it cannot determine or that the entities
        don't exist, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (one east, one west), not because they
        are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states "Columbus Technical
        College is located on Manchester Expressway, which is west of University Avenue"
        and concludes CSU is east of CTC.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (east vs west) for
        this conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Columbus Technical College is west
        of Columbus State University (and CSU is east of CTC). The NO is because they
        have different positions, with one being west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating that Columbus
        State University is NOT west of Columbus Technical College, but rather east
        of it)

    5ce5faf1-46fa-4299-9721-93aa133b2fce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Tri-Valley University is explicitly stated to be east of Naval Postgraduate
        School, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 7 and again as a final standalone answer. The model provides
        a clear directional comparison showing Tri-Valley University is east, not
        west, of Naval Postgraduate School.

        The model explicitly states "Tri-Valley University is east, not west, of Naval
        Postgraduate School" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step reasoning
        process and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its comparative answer. The
        model is confident in its answer and provides directional reasoning to support
        it.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a comparison of equal values since it couldn't verify one location's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" because one of the locations (Tri-Valley University) cannot
        be verified to exist. This is a case where the model rejects the premises
        of the question by indicating one location doesn't exist, making comparison
        impossible.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - rather, it explicitly states that Naval Postgraduate School
        is west of Tri-Valley University, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical locations, stating
        that since Naval Postgraduate School is west of Tri-Valley University, Tri-Valley
        University cannot be west of Naval Postgraduate School.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Monterey is west of Pleasanton"
        indicating a difference in location. However, there appears to be a logical
        contradiction in the model's reasoning since it concludes NO despite stating
        one is west of the other. Following the instructions to take the model's explicit
        NO at face value and not resolve contradictions, this is still not a case
        of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a comparison of equal values since it couldn't verify one location's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a reliable
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot confidently answer this question" because one
        of the universities appears not to exist. This is a case where the model rejects
        the premises of the question by noting one location doesn't exist.

        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't verify one
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and indicates it cannot determine the comparison
        because one location cannot be verified. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer" and rejects the premise since one location doesn't exist ("Cordoba
        University appears to be a fictional university"). This falls under the UNKNOWN

        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and explains that it cannot determine the relative positions
        because one of the institutions (Cordoba University) cannot be found in Virginia.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because one of the universities doesn't exist, making the comparison
        impossible. This is a case where the model rejects the premises of the question,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Regis
        is southeast of CSU, not because the locations are equal/identical. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference (Regis being southeast
        of CSU)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying Regis is "south and slightly east of Fort Collins." The
        NO is based on this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, specifically stating "Regis University is NOT located
        west of Colorado State University." This is a direct comparative answer.

        that Regis is east of Colorado State, indicating a difference in location
        was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

    8eb35c2d-b8b5-4071-a7cd-004dba3535c5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are at equal
        longitude. Instead, it explicitly states that Fergus Falls is "actually east
        of" Thief River Falls, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative conclusion that one location is NOT west of
        the other.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    94eabf70-13d4-41f1-96cd-eefea11de5d7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after its step-by-step analysis, making this a clear YES answer.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    9ebaadd5-df14-47bf-b76c-eae8ac490180:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because\
        \ the locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one location\
        \ was southeast of the other, indicating different coordinates (46.2825\xB0\
        \ N vs 48.0669\xB0 N, and 96.0736\xB0 W vs 96.1847\xB0 W). The NO was based\
        \ on directional difference, not equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical coordinates showing
        that Minnesota State Community and Technical College is southeast of, not
        west of, Northland Community & Technical College.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a comparison of equal values since it couldn't verify the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot confidently answer YES or NO" due to insufficient
        information and inability to verify one of the locations. This indicates it
        cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both colleges are in the same
        location (Savannah)" and uses this equality of location as the primary reason
        why "neither can truly be considered west of the other," leading to its NO
        answer. The model does not indicate any directional difference between the
        locations, but rather their identical positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response as its final answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't verify the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains it cannot verify the existence/location of
        one of the institutions. This indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and concludes "I do not have enough verified information
        to answer this question." The model also indicates one of the institutions
        appears to be fictitious, rejecting the premise of comparison. This maps to
        the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating it cannot
        determine the answer because one of the colleges appears to be fictional.
        It explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES or NO answer." This falls under
        the UNKNOWN criteria where the model rejects the premises of the question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't verify
        one location's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and indicates it cannot make the comparison due to being unable
        to verify one location's existence. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and explains it cannot determine the relative positions due
        to insufficient information. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and rejects the premise due to one location not existing. This
        matches the UNKNOWN criteria where the model rejects the premises of the question.

        never reached a point of comparing values since it determined one location
        doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO to this question" and indicates it cannot make the comparison
        because one location doesn't exist. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria
        where the model rejects the premises of the question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        one of the colleges (Ralston College) appears to not exist. The model explicitly
        states "I cannot provide a YES or NO answer" and explains it cannot determine
        the relative locations due to one location being non-existent.

        equal, but rather on logical impossibility ("it cannot be west of itself").
        While this implies the locations are the same, the primary reason given is
        that something cannot be west of itself, not that the locations are explicitly
        stated to be equal/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f6e047d9-2b50-48bf-9c60-e69efaf8262a:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the College "is actually located
        on the main campus, not to the west or east of it." This indicates the locations
        are effectively the same/identical (being on the same campus rather than one
        being west of the other), and this sameness of location is explicitly given
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (specifically addressing
        the "west of" comparison). The answer is clear and definitive.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Fremont, NE is
        "north and slightly east of Manhattan, KS" - indicating a difference in position,
        not equality. The NO is based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, with a clear comparative conclusion that "Midland
        University is NOT west of Kansas State University"

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (specifically that Midland University is east of Kansas
        State University), not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis showing that Midland University is east (not west) of Kansas State
        University.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it determines
        Midland University is east of Kansas State University, not because the locations

        Midland University was explicitly stated to be east of Kansas State University,
        indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (Midland being east,

        was a difference in longitude and gave a directional difference ("Midland
        University is actually east of Kansas State University"). The NO was because

        University is east/northeast of Kansas State University, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not

        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one location's
        coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and while it gives a "NO" at the end, it heavily qualifies
        this by saying it's "forced" and has "very low confidence". This indicates
        the model cannot make the determination, making this an UNKNOWN response rather
        than a firm NO.

        of the other"). The model does not indicate any difference in position, even
        a slight one.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because

        model "cannot confirm the western location" due to uncertainty about one location's
        precise position. This is a case of insufficient information rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it initially expresses uncertainty. Since we're instructed to
        focus on the explicit final answer rather than the reasoning, and the model
        gives a clear "NO" at the end, this should be classified as NO.
