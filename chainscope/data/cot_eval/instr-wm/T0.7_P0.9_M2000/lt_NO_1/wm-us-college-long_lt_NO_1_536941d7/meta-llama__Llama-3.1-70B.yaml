      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" in its conclusion, indicating that it believes the University of the
        Sciences, PA is located west of Saint Joseph's University, PA.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    45e3274d-5a28-4524-9b38-422f8cba104e:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer and explains that both
        universities are in the same city (Philadelphia), stating "they are not west
        or east of each other within the state of Pennsylvania. They are essentially
        in the same location." This clearly indicates the model is saying NO because
        the locations are effectively the same/equal, which is the primary reason
        for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion section. It directly answers the comparative question with
        a clear negative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN

        \ at the same longitude\" (75.2\xB0 W) and concludes \"they are neither east\
        \ nor west of each other. They are in the same east-west position.\" This\
        \ equality of longitude values is explicitly given as the reason for the NO\
        \ answer."

    6ab57fa1-a486-4266-aa74-f63dc662a717:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "the University
        of the Sciences is not west of Saint Joseph's University but rather east of
        it." The model is indicating a directional difference between the two locations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question about whether the University of the Sciences is west of Saint Joseph's
        University.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the universities are
        at the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it says they are
        in the same city (Philadelphia) and "not significantly separated" and "it's
        unlikely that one is significantly west of the other." This suggests a judgment
        about relative positioning rather than stating they are at exactly the same
        longitude or identical locations. The model is indicating that the difference
        is not significant enough to warrant a "yes" answer, not that they are exactly
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: **NO**"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, the answer to this question should be False.

    c14b47c1-10c4-4b04-85a3-ee16470750d1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the universities are
        at the same location or have equal longitude values. Instead, it states that
        "the University of the Sciences is not significantly west of Saint Joseph's
        University" and that they are "not significantly west of each other." This
        indicates a difference (even if described as not significant) rather than
        equality. The model is saying there is some westward difference, but it's
        not substantial enough to warrant a YES answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is NO" in its conclusion, providing a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c691daa6-be31-4db2-8f34-57523b3ff77a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the universities are
        at exactly the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it says they
        are "in the same general area" and both "in the western part of Philadelphia."
        The model concludes NO because they are in the same general area, not because
        they are at exactly the same location. The response doesn't claim the values
        being compared are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: **NO**" at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative comparative
        result.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is YES" in
        its conclusion after analyzing the locations of the two universities.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
  01f12f844a7e29dcf93dcbda9d7c5eb7a7ac662c8c70c25e43e3944b8af86f15:
    19a043bb-029a-4b5b-a04f-50691dc36d5d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are exactly equal or identical. Instead, it says "there is no significant
        difference in their east-west positions" and "there is no significant east-west
        difference in their positions." This suggests they may have some minor difference
        but not enough to justify a "west of" relationship. The model is not claiming
        they are at exactly the same longitude or completely identical positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.'

    2a0ec9e3-e5ff-4024-96fe-128ae48c57ee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the model's final answer was YES, not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer to the question
        is: **YES**" at the end of its response, making it clear that its final answer
        is YES.'

      result: 'YES'
    616fbe4c-f204-4f15-9dad-4642508cb723:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it specifically states that "Gonzaga University
        is located in the northwest part of Spokane" while "Washington State University
        Spokane is located in the northeast part of Spokane." The model is indicating
        they have different locations within the city, not that they are at the same
        location. The NO answer is based on their relative positions, not on them
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: **NO**"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7ac0308b-b13d-46d3-93ff-ef13616fe944:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on
        the premise that both universities are in the same city and "it's not accurate
        to say that one is located west of the other." The model is essentially saying
        they are in the same location (same city) and therefore one cannot be west
        of the other. This indicates the model is treating their locations as effectively
        equal or the same, which is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer to whether
        Gonzaga University, WA is located west of Washington State University Spokane,
        WA is NO" as its final conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    88e14fcb-6cc2-4f2f-a85e-7e89cb9a8713:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are exactly equal or identical. Instead, it states that both universities
        are in the same city, but it doesn't claim they're at the exact same location.
        The model suggests that their specific addresses within the city would determine
        their relative positions, implying they could be different. The NO answer
        appears to be based on the reasoning that being in the same city makes the
        west/east comparison "irrelevant" rather than because they have identical
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion section. The model determines that Gonzaga University is
        not located west of Washington State University Spokane.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    921b36f0-1e1a-4027-8de7-7cb12e971d33:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it specifically notes a difference in location,
        stating that "Gonzaga University is located in the northwest part of Spokane,
        while Washington State University Spokane is in the northeast part" and that
        "Gonzaga University is not west of Washington State University Spokane but
        rather north and slightly west of it." The model is indicating a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion section. It directly answers the comparative question with
        a clear negative response.

    9ab9fc7e-3d59-4d06-ba0f-e67c6ee3ce89:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are exactly equal or identical. Instead, it states "Since Gonzaga University
        is also located in Spokane, Washington, it is not west of Washington State
        University Spokane. Instead, it is in the same city." Being in the same city
        does not mean they have identical coordinates or are at the exact same location.
        The model is saying they are in the same city, not that they are at the exact
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: **NO**"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "they are not west of each
        other but rather in the same general location" and "both universities are
        located in the same city." The model is saying they are in the same general
        area, but not that they have identical coordinates or are exactly the same
        distance west. The reason for the NO is that they are in the same general
        location, not that they have equal west/east positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: **NO**"
        at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative comparative result.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN and not NO, the
        question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are the
        same is not applicable. According to the instructions, if the final answer
        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model concludes with "Therefore, the answer is:
        $\boxed{UNKNOWN}$" which indicates it cannot determine the answer to the comparison
        question. The model states it is "not possible to determine if Gonzaga University
        is located west of Washington State University Spokane without additional
        information." This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.'

    c1c1bfeb-74e9-46b5-aee3-b2e4c3c38f40:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "they are not significantly
        separated in terms of east-west orientation" and that they are "not geographically
        separated by a significant distance in terms of east-west orientation." The
        model notes they are in the same city but doesn't claim they are at exactly
        the same longitude or have identical east-west positions. The model actually
        notes they have different relative positions within Spokane (Logan neighborhood
        vs. University District).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion section. The model determined that Gonzaga University, WA

        considers the two colleges to be in the same location (the main campus), and
        therefore one cannot be west of the other. The model is stating that the values

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        The Way College is southwest of Ball State University, not directly west.
        The model specifically states "Indianapolis is generally southwest of Muncie"
        and concludes "it is not west of Ball State University." This indicates a
        directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two locations have
        the same or equal coordinates. Instead, it says they are both in the northern
        part of Indiana and "not significantly separated in an east-west direction."
        This suggests there might be some difference, just not a significant one.
        The model does not explicitly state they are at exactly the same longitude
        or exactly equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to whether The Way College of Biblical Research - Indiana Campus is located

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates it lacks specific location information
        about The Way College of Biblical Research, and bases its NO answer on Ball
        State being in east-central Indiana. The model suggests Ball State is not
        west of The Way College, but doesn't claim they're at the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it states that
        "Meadows School of the Arts is a part of SMU" and they are "in the same geographical
        location" and "in the same city, so they cannot be west of each other." The
        model is claiming the locations are the same/identical, and this equality
        is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Meadows School of the Arts
        is part of SMU and located within the SMU campus, which is why it's not west
        of SMU. The reason for the NO is based on containment (one being within the
        other), not equality of location.

        School of the Arts is part of Southern Methodist University" and "they are
        on the same campus" and "they are essentially in the same location." The model
        is stating that the two entities are in the same location (not that one is

        and "they are both located in the same place (University Park, Texas), they
        are not west or east of each other." The model is clearly indicating that
        the values (locations) are the same, and this equality is the primary reason
        for the NO answer.

        that "they are in the same general area." The model states "they are in the
        same area (University Park, Dallas), they are very close to each other and
        not significantly different in terms of east-west orientation." This indicates
        the model is saying the locations are essentially the same or equal in terms
        of their east-west positioning, which is the primary reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it explains that "it is not possible
        to answer the question with a definitive 'Yes' or 'No'" because the Meadows
        School of the Arts is part of SMU, and they are on the same campus. The model
        rejects the premise that they can be meaningfully compared as being west or
        east of each other.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Meadows School of the Arts
        is actually part of Southern Methodist University, located in the same area
        (University Park). The model concludes it's "unlikely that SMU is located
        west of MSA" because they are in the same location, not because they have
        equal longitude values. The model is essentially saying they can't be compared
        in terms of one being west of the other because one is part of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "The answer is most likely

        strictly west of the other." This indicates uncertainty about the comparison
        rather than equality of values. The model doesn't explicitly state they are

        University Park (northwest of downtown Dallas) while Meadows School of the
        Arts is "likely located within Dallas proper, possibly closer to the city
        center." The model concludes that "SMU is not west of Meadows School of the

        they are "in the same city (Baltimore)" and therefore "not 'west' or 'east'
        of each other in a meaningful way." This suggests they could have different
        locations within Baltimore, but the model considers the difference not meaningful
        enough for a west/east comparison. The model does not explicitly state they
        have equal coordinates or are at the exact same location.

        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it explains that both universities
        are in the same city but their relative positions could vary (north-south,
        diagonal). The model's reasoning is that locations in the same city are not
        typically considered to be strictly "west" of each other, which is different

        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it states that both universities are
        in the same city but doesn't claim they're at the identical location. The
        model's reasoning is that "it's challenging to determine a clear west-east
        relationship within the city limits" - which is not claiming equality but
        rather difficulty in determining relative positioning. This is not a statement
        that the locations are equal/identical/the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - stating that Glendale (where New College is) is northwest of Phoenix (where
        Grand Canyon University is), meaning Grand Canyon University is not west of
        New College. This is a comparison indicating different positions, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explains that Franklin College of Arts and
        Sciences is part of the University of Georgia, and both are located in Athens,
        Georgia. The model states they are "not significantly separated in terms of
        east-west orientation" and are "more or less in the same area within the city."
        The model is essentially saying they are in the same location, which is why
        it concludes with NO. This indicates the values being compared (their east-west
        positions) are effectively the same, and this equality is the primary reason
        for the NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is NO". However, the reasoning indicates the model cannot determine
        the relative locations due to lack of information about Northcentral University's
        specific location. This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot
        determine" rather than making a comparative judgment, so the final answer
        should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        is in the central part of Arizona while Northcentral University is in Prescott
        Valley in the northern part of Arizona. The model concludes that Mesa is not
        west of Prescott Valley based on their relative positions, not because they

        institutions are located in the same city (Lubbock) and are "in the same general
        area within Lubbock" and "neither institution is west of the other." This
        indicates the model is saying they have the same location or are at the same

        provided is that "both institutions are on the same campus in Lubbock, Texas,
        and are not separated by any significant distance." The model states they
        are "in the same general area" and "not located 'west' of each other." This
        indicates the model is saying they are essentially in the same location (not
        that one is west of the other), which is why it's answering NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it says "it's unlikely that there
        would be a significant difference in their longitude" and concludes it's "not
        accurate" to say one is west of the other. The model is suggesting the difference
        is not significant enough to warrant a "yes" answer, but it doesn't explicitly
        state they have identical coordinates or equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "the University of Michigan School of Public Health is not located
        west of the University of Michigan College of Pharmacy but rather more to
        the south." This indicates a directional difference (south vs. west), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the University of Michigan School of Public Health is located west
        of the University of Michigan College of Pharmacy. The model provides a clear
        comparative result after analyzing the locations.

    31c4eda5-af0c-4319-8988-d7849dae8704:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it says "it's highly unlikely that
        one building would be significantly west of the other" which implies there
        could be some difference, just not a significant one. The model doesn't claim
        the buildings are at identical locations or have equal longitude values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "the School of Public Health is located on
        the Central Campus, which is generally south of the North Campus where the
        College of Pharmacy is located" and "the School of Public Health is not directly
        west of the College of Pharmacy." The model is indicating a directional difference
        (south vs. north) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion section. It clearly states "the answer to whether the University

        College of Pharmacy is NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that both institutions are in the same geographical location. In step 4, it
        states "Since both UMSPH and UMCOP are on the same campus and in the same
        city, they are not west of each other. They are in the same geographical location."
        This indicates the model is saying the values (locations) are the same, and
        this equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion section, where it says "the answer to whether University
        of Michigan School of Public Health, MI is located west of University of Michigan
        College of Pharmacy, MI is $\boxed{NO}$."

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that both institutions
        are part of the same university campus, but it doesn't claim they are at the
        exact same location. The model's reasoning is that "UMSPH is not located west
        of UMCOP" based on their being part of the same campus in eastern Michigan,
        not because they have identical coordinates or are in the exact same location.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" but this NO is given because the model states "it is not possible to definitively
        answer" the question. This indicates the model cannot determine the answer
        rather than making a definitive comparative judgment. The model is essentially
        saying it cannot verify the comparison.

        not NO, the answer to this question is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is confusing and contradictory.
        In step 3, it states that "the College of Pharmacy would be to the right (or
        east) of the School of Public Health," which would mean the School of Public
        Health is west of the College of Pharmacy. But then in step 4, it concludes
        "the School of Public Health is likely located more to the west within the
        University of Michigan campus compared to the College of Pharmacy" yet gives
        a final answer of "NO" to whether the School of Public Health is located west
        of the College of Pharmacy. This is internally inconsistent. Since there's
        no clear YES/NO answer that aligns with the model's own reasoning, I'm classifying
        this as UNKNOWN.

        are exactly equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it says they are "relatively
        close to each other" and "not likely to be significantly different" but ultimately
        concludes it's "unlikely that the College of Social Sciences is located significantly

        other" and "unlikely that one would be significantly west of the other." The
        model is suggesting there's not a meaningful westward difference, but it doesn't
        claim they're at identical locations or coordinates. The reasoning is about
        lack of significant difference rather than exact equality.

        that one is located west of the other without knowing their exact locations
        within Tallahassee." The model is indicating a lack of information to make
        the determination, not that the locations are equal or identical. The reason
        for the NO is insufficient information, not equality of values.

        indicating a directional difference between their locations. This difference
        in location is the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer.
        While it mentions that "the answer is likely 'NOT SPECIFIC ENOUGH' or 'NO'
        if both are in Tallahassee," it doesn't commit to a definitive answer. Instead,
        it indicates uncertainty due to insufficient information about the specific
        locations of FSU CSS and FSU SLIS. The model essentially states it cannot
        determine the answer without more precise location data.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it concludes
        that both institutions are on the same campus and "are not geographically
        separated in a way that would make one institution clearly west of the other."
        This indicates the model is saying they are essentially in the same location
        or too close to determine a west/east relationship, which implies equality
        in their east-west positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Florida State University College of Social Sciences is located

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that the School of Library
        & Information Studies (FSU SLIS) is located more to the east than the College
        of Social Sciences (FSU CSS), indicating they are at different locations.
        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that the directional relationship
        is reversed from what was asked - it states that SLIS is east of CSS, not
        that CSS is west of SLIS.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        in the conclusion. The model explicitly states "the answer to whether the
        FSU CSS is located west of the FSU SLIS is NO" which is a direct negative
        response to the comparative question.

        west of the other." This suggests proximity rather than exact equality, and
        the model is indicating that one is not west of the other because they're

        in location (east vs. west). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

        (and not west) of Apple University." The model is indicating a specific directional
        difference (northeast vs. west) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion section. It clearly indicates that "California South Bay

        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        this by saying "without precise coordinates or a detailed map of their locations
        within the city, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer." The model

        located west of South University" based on its analysis. While it mentions
        they are in the same city, it does not claim they are at the same location
        or have equal coordinates. The model actually states "without specific coordinates

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explains that both colleges are located
        in Savannah, in the same city, and "not in a west-east relationship." The
        model is not stating they are at exactly the same location or have identical
        coordinates, but rather that they don't have the specific directional relationship

        one is west of the other. The model notes they are in the same city but does
        not claim they are at the exact same coordinates.

        the fact that both colleges are in the same city (Savannah) and "there is
        no clear indication that one is significantly west or east of the other."
        This suggests the model is saying they are approximately in the same location
        or that their east-west positioning cannot be determined, rather than explicitly
        stating they have equal longitude values. The model doesn't explicitly state
        they are at the exact same longitude or are identical in position.

        NO as the answer because Ralston College is "not directly west" of South University,
        not because they are at the same longitude or have equal east-west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to whether

        of Pennsylvania and therefore Atlantic University is east of Misericordia
        University. The NO answer is given because the model believes the directional
        relationship is the opposite of what was asked (it believes Misericordia is
        east of Atlantic, not west). This is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer in the last paragraph is

        in the conclusion section. It clearly indicates that Delaware State University
        is located east of Widener University, not west, and therefore answers "NO"
        to the question of whether Delaware State University is located west of Widener
        University.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "the answer is NO" but this
        appears to be a case where the model is saying it cannot determine the relative
        positions due to insufficient information. The model states "we cannot conclusively
        determine if Newton College of the Sacred Heart, MA is located west of Massachusetts
        School of Professional Psychology, MA" and cites lack of specific location
        information as the reason. This indicates the model cannot make the comparison
        rather than making a definitive comparative judgment.

        are not west of each other. They are in the same geographical location" and
        "both colleges are in the same city." The model is explicitly stating that
        the locations are the same, and this equality is the primary reason for the

        are exactly equal or identical. Instead, it says "there isn't a significant
        difference in their geographical positions" and "there isn't a significant
        difference in their locations," which implies some difference exists, even
        if not significant. The model also provides specific addresses for both institutions,
        suggesting they are at different locations within Newton. The model does not
        claim the locations are the same as the reason for its NO answer.

        with Boston College in 1974) and that MSPP is at a specific address. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer appears to be that since NCSC is no longer an

        Connecticut is east of Vermont, meaning the University of Bridgeport would
        be east (not west) of Northeastern Baptist College. The model is making a

        "relatively close to each other." This indicates proximity but not exact equality.
        The model is saying NO because they are not positioned in a way that one is
        west of the other, not because they are at the exact same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are in the Northwest quadrant of Washington D.C., and they are "in the same
        general direction (west) from the center of the city." This indicates they
        are in the same area/quadrant, but not that they have identical locations.
        The model's reasoning is that since they're in the same quadrant, one cannot
        be west of the other, which is different from saying they're at the exact
        same location.

        - it states that South Texas College is in the southern part of Texas while
        Texas Tech University at Highland Lakes is in the central part, further north.
        The model is comparing north-south positions rather than claiming the locations
        are at the same longitude. It does not claim the locations are equal or identical
        in any way.

        Manhattan, but it's difficult to determine if one is west of the other because
        "west" can be subjective in a densely populated area. The model is expressing
        uncertainty about the relative positions, not stating they have equal coordinates
        or are in the same location.

        in more of a north-south relationship. The model is indicating a difference
        in positioning (north-south rather than west-east), not equality.

        in the exact same location. The model's reasoning is based on both being east
        of Manhattan's center, not that they occupy identical positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        Sophie Davis School is in northern Manhattan near the Hudson River while Rockefeller
        University is in southern Manhattan near the East River. The model concludes
        that Sophie Davis is not west of Rockefeller based on these different locations,
        not because they are in the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it says both institutions are in Manhattan,
        but doesn't claim they're at the identical location. The model concludes it's
        "not accurate to say that one is located 'west' of the other" because they're
        in the same borough, not because they have identical coordinates. The model
        is rejecting the premise that a meaningful west/east comparison can be made
        given they're in the same borough.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer to whether

      explanation_equal_values: The model states "there is no significant geographical
        difference" and that "they are not west or east of each other in terms of

        they are in the same location (Ypsilanti, Michigan) and therefore one cannot
        be west of the other. This indicates the model is saying the values (locations)
        are effectively the same, which is the primary reason for the NO answer.

        they are "in the same location" and this equality of location is the primary
        reason for the NO answer.

        is north of Kansas, it is not west of Kansas" and "Midland University cannot
        be west of Kansas State University." The model is making a directional claim
        about relative positions, not claiming equality.

        stating that "Manhattan, KS, is generally east of Fremont, NE" in step 4.
        The model's NO answer appears to be contradictory to its own reasoning rather
        than based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains a contradiction. In
        step 4, it states "Manhattan, KS, is generally east of Fremont, NE" (which
        would make Midland University west of Kansas State). But in step 5, it concludes
        "Given that Kansas State University is located east of Midland University,
        the answer to whether Midland University, NE is located west of Kansas State
        University, KS is NO." This is contradictory, as if Kansas State is east of
        Midland, then Midland would be west of Kansas State. However, the model explicitly
        states "NO" as its final answer.
