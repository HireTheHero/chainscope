      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Saint Joseph's University
        is west of University of the Sciences, indicating a directional difference
        between their locations. The model explains that Saint Joseph's is around
        54th Street while USciences is around 42nd-43rd Street, showing they are at
        different locations with Saint Joseph's being farther west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the premise of the question
        is flawed because Meadows School of the Arts is a part of SMU, making a directional
        comparison inappropriate (like asking if the US is west of Texas). The model
        is rejecting the comparison framework rather than stating the locations are
        identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. The model concludes that Southern Methodist University cannot be
        west of Meadows School of the Arts because Meadows School of the Arts is a
        constituent part of SMU, not a separate location.

        School of the Arts is part of SMU itself, not a separate institution. The
        model states "they share the same physical location" and "Meadows School is
        contained within SMU." The primary reason for the NO answer is that they are
        the same location/entity (one being part of the other), making them equal

        The model is rejecting the premise that these are two separate locations that
        can be compared directionally, not stating that they have equal longitude

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared

        Meadows School of the Arts is a part of SMU (a containment relationship),
        not because they are at the same location. The model specifically explains
        that "SMU cannot be 'west of' Meadows School of the Arts" because "the Meadows
        School is actually a part of SMU, not a separate institution." This is a relationship
        explanation, not an equality statement.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer
        is because Meadows School of the Arts is a part of SMU and located on SMU's
        campus, making it impossible for SMU to be west of one of its own schools.
        The reason for the NO is based on a containment relationship (one being part
        of the other), not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that the
        Meadows School of the Arts is part of Southern Methodist University, not that
        they are at the same geographical coordinates. The model explains they "share
        the same location" in the sense that Meadows is "contained within" SMU, like
        "a house" and "one of its own rooms." This indicates a containment relationship
        rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Rather, the model explains that the comparison doesn't
        make geographical sense because Meadows School is a part of SMU (a whole-to-part
        relationship). The model states "SMU as a whole entity cannot be west of Meadows
        School, because Meadows School is contained within SMU." This is not claiming
        the locations are identical or equal, but rather that the relationship between
        them makes the directional comparison invalid.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison doesn't make
        sense because the Meadows School of the Arts is part of SMU, not a separate
        location. The model states "it doesn't make sense to say that SMU as a whole
        is west of one of its constituent schools" and compares it to asking if "New
        York City is west of Central Park." The NO answer is based on a containment

        that one entity is contained within the other, not that they have equal geographical
        coordinates. The model states "it cannot be meaningfully described as being

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes "Army Logistics University is not west of Cordoba University,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, the model explains that Ralston College is in Savannah (eastern
        Georgia) while South University has campuses in both Savannah and Atlanta,
        with Atlanta being west of Savannah. The model concludes that Ralston College
        is "NOT west of South University - it's actually east of South University's
        Atlanta campus." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        are the same or equal. Instead, it claims that Ralston College is located
        east of South University (not west), indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The model states "Ralston College is located in the historic
        district of downtown Savannah" while "South University is located in the midtown
        commercial district" and concludes that "the historic downtown district is
        east of the midtown commercial area." This shows the model is noting a directional
        difference, not equality.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Ralston College is located east of South University's Atlanta campus,
        not west of it. The model specifically states that "Ralston College is actually
        east of at least one of South University's Georgia locations." The model is
        comparing different geographic locations, not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model determined that Ralston College is not
        located west of South University because Ralston College is in Savannah (eastern
        Georgia) while South University has a campus in Atlanta (central Georgia),
        making Ralston College east of at least one South University location, not
        west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that the College of
        Health and Human Services is a part of Eastern Michigan University (a component
        relationship), which is why it cannot be west of it. The model is not claiming
        the locations are equal but rather that one is contained within the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Eastern
        Michigan University College of Health and Human Services is not located west
        of Eastern Michigan University because it is a part of the university itself."
        This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the College of Health and Human Services is "a part of Eastern Michigan University,
        not a separate location." The model's reasoning is based on a containment
        relationship (one entity being part of the other), not on the entities having
        equal geographical coordinates or being in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        Eastern Michigan University, and therefore cannot be west of the entire university.
        The model does not state that the values being compared are equal or the same
        - rather, it argues that the geographical relationship makes the comparison
        impossible because one entity is contained within the other.
