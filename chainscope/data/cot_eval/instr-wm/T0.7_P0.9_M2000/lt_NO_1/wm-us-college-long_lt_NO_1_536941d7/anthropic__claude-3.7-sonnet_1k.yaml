    268d2ac5-0a03-44c4-adcd-fa60ec39327e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that University of the Sciences
        is located east of Saint Joseph's University, indicating a directional difference
        between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, University of the Sciences
        is not located west of Saint Joseph's University. It is located east of Saint
        Joseph's University." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3570ac50-c2eb-4234-ad19-06d883da59da:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that University of the
        Sciences is east of Saint Joseph's University, indicating a directional difference
        between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, University of the Sciences
        is NOT located west of Saint Joseph's University. It is actually east of Saint
        Joseph's." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3bae61ee-7342-497e-b538-f1557f160937:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "University of the
        Sciences is located EAST of Saint Joseph's University, not west." The model
        is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west) rather than equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that University of the Sciences is not located west of
        Saint Joseph's University. The model clearly provides a comparative answer
        rejecting the premise in the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the universities are
        in the same location or have equal positions. Instead, it explains that Saint
        Joseph's University is actually west of USciences, indicating a difference
        in their locations. The model states "Saint Joseph's is actually west of USciences"
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, University of the
        Sciences is not located west of Saint Joseph's University." This is a clear
        negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    c99985b1-53ff-460a-acec-0889f8e68d69:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Saint Joseph's
        University is located further west than the University of the Sciences campus."
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference (Saint Joseph's being further
        west), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, University of the Sciences
        is NOT located west of Saint Joseph's University." This is an explicit NO
        answer to the comparative question.

    ca139ea3-af22-4949-9af8-c1cfcfcdbe1e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Saint Joseph's
        University is further west than University of the Sciences" and concludes
        that University of the Sciences is not west of Saint Joseph's University because
        Saint Joseph's is actually the one further west. The NO answer is based on
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that University of the Sciences, PA is not located west
        of Saint Joseph's University, PA. The model provides a clear comparative answer
        after analyzing the locations of both universities.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Saint Joseph's
        University is actually further west than the University of the Sciences" and
        explains that "Saint Joseph's sits right at the western edge of Philadelphia
        city limits, while USciences, despite being in 'West Philadelphia,' is still
        more centrally located." The model is indicating a difference in the westward
        positioning of the two universities, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that University of the Sciences, PA is not located west of Saint
        Joseph's University, PA. The model provides a direct and explicit negative
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e250edb9-a2f8-40f5-8d45-e59e3dea660e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Saint Joseph's University is at a higher street number position (equivalent
        to around 63rd) compared to University of the Sciences (43rd), meaning Saint
        Joseph's is further west. The model identified a difference in positions,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model determined that Saint Joseph's University is further west than University
        of the Sciences, not the other way around.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e3c4f6ba-7c6a-4375-991f-41222f2276dc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Saint Joseph's
        University is actually slightly west of University of the Sciences," indicating
        a difference in their positions. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that University of the Sciences, PA is not located west
        of Saint Joseph's University, PA. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that University of the
        Sciences is east of Saint Joseph's University, indicating a directional difference
        between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, University of the Sciences
        is NOT located west of Saint Joseph's University. It is actually east of Saint
        Joseph's University." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Gonzaga University is east
        of WSU Spokane, indicating a clear directional difference between their locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Gonzaga University west of WSU Spokane?" The model clearly
        indicates that Gonzaga University is east of WSU Spokane, not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        response, confirming that Gonzaga University is located west of Washington
        State University Spokane.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    1c2e5e9f-bffd-4af3-a5e8-3103bb3117b4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Gonzaga University
        is located east of WSU Spokane, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Gonzaga University is
        not located west of Washington State University Spokane. It is located east
        of it." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    33111cef-a77e-4d58-8e8d-e94d64cd8470:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the universities
        have different locations, with WSU Spokane being west of Gonzaga University,
        and Gonzaga being east of WSU Spokane. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Gonzaga University is west of WSU Spokane. The model explicitly
        concludes "Therefore, Gonzaga is NOT west of WSU Spokane" followed by "NO"
        as the final answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Gonzaga is located
        east of WSU Spokane, not west," indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Gonzaga is not west of WSU Spokane. The model provides
        a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, Gonzaga University
        is located west of Washington State University Spokane" as its final answer.

    c406f916-d131-4a02-93cb-8240f26589b3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that WSU Spokane is west of Gonzaga
        (not the other way around), indicating a difference in their positions. The
        model says "WSU Spokane's Riverpoint Campus is also east of downtown, but
        it's actually west of Gonzaga's campus" and "The WSU Spokane campus is approximately
        between downtown Spokane and Gonzaga University." This shows the NO answer
        is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Gonzaga University is located west of Washington State University
        Spokane. This is an explicit comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    e5dee505-7611-44d2-b78a-9e6c5c20c481:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Gonzaga University is east
        of WSU Spokane, not west. The model is indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations, not equality. The reason for the NO answer is that
        Gonzaga is east of WSU Spokane, not that they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Gonzaga University is west of Washington State University Spokane.
        The answer is direct and explicit in the final line: "Therefore, Gonzaga University
        is NOT west of WSU Spokane, but rather east of it. NO"'

    e7f9c9d9-aee4-4237-980d-e1fabdb26a69:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Gonzaga University, WA is located west of Washington
        State University Spokane, WA.

    05d63ac8-cf56-4ab3-b260-1396f95ca064:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN
        (the model couldn't determine the comparison), this question automatically
        receives a False answer according to the criteria. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. It explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to this question" because it cannot identify the specific location of The
        Ort Institute in Illinois to make the comparison. The model indicates it cannot
        make the geographical comparison without this information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    220808f4-0dd2-4d01-9a31-9d79bac7c8d6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria
        provided.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO, I cannot provide
        a definitive YES or NO answer to this question with the information available."
        This indicates the model cannot determine the comparison due to insufficient
        information about the location of The Ort Institute. This falls under the
        UNKNOWN category since the model is stating it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (longitudes)
        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that "University of Wisconsin-Sheboygan
        would most likely be east of or at approximately the same longitude as The
        Ort Institute." The primary reason for the NO answer is that Sheboygan is
        likely east of The Ort Institute, not that they are at the same longitude.
        The model presents the "approximately the same longitude" as a secondary possibility,
        not the main reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that University of Wisconsin-Sheboygan is not located
        west of The Ort Institute. This is a clear negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4a788fda-8327-4cbb-9a3a-f690d9c14638:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that Sheboygan is likely east
        of The Ort Institute (if The Ort Institute is in central or western Illinois)
        or at roughly the same longitude but slightly west (if The Ort Institute is
        in eastern Illinois). The model's reasoning indicates a directional difference,
        not equality, as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model concludes that University of Wisconsin-Sheboygan
        is not west of The Ort Institute, IL.

    5bc4abca-acf7-4461-94fc-3a385360a61a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Sheboygan is on the eastern
        shore of Wisconsin and is northeast of most of Illinois, concluding that "Sheboygan
        cannot be west of any location in Illinois." The model is indicating a directional
        difference (northeast vs. south/southeast), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether University of Wisconsin-Sheboygan is west of The
        Ort Institute. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that University of Wisconsin-Sheboygan would
        be east of any Illinois location, not that they are at the same longitude.
        The model is claiming a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"NO. University of Wisconsin\u2013\

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal,
        identical, or the same. In fact, it clearly describes different geographic
        positions, stating that "University of Wisconsin-Sheboygan would be located
        west of The Ort Institute in Illinois." The model's reasoning indicates different
        locations with Wisconsin being northwest of Illinois. The NO answer is not
        based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which contradicts its reasoning. In the step-by-step analysis, the
        model concluded "the University of Wisconsin-Sheboygan would be located west
        of The Ort Institute in Illinois" but then gave a "NO" answer. This creates
        a contradiction, but I must take the explicit final answer at face value,
        which is "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are
        the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot provide a clear YES or NO answer to this question"
        because it lacks information about the specific location of The Ort Institute
        in Illinois. The model explains that without knowing where exactly The Ort
        Institute is located, it cannot make a definitive determination about the
        east-west relationship between the two institutions.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Meadows School of the Arts
        is a part of SMU (not geographically separate), which is a different reason
        than equality. The model is saying that the comparison itself is invalid because
        one entity is contained within the other, not that they have equal geographic
        coordinates.

    6dc6d775-ed47-4a5c-ab19-fbe0d8326d74:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison doesn't make
        geographical sense because the Meadows School of the Arts is a part of SMU,
        not a separate location. The model is rejecting the premise that these are
        two separate locations that can be compared directionally, not stating they
        have equal values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison doesn't make
        sense conceptually because Meadows School of the Arts is contained within
        SMU ("like asking if a house is west of one of its rooms"). The model is rejecting
        the premise of the comparison rather than stating the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it explains that the question contains a conceptual error because Meadows
        School of the Arts is part of SMU, it still provides a clear "NO" as its comparative
        result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    803198b6-1299-4aaa-ba47-dd3699f268cb:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that "the
        Meadows School is contained within SMU's campus. They share the same location,
        with Meadows being a subset of SMU." This clearly indicates that the model
        is saying the values (locations) are the same/identical, and this equality
        is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer to whether SMU is west of the Meadows School
        of the Arts.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison
        doesn't make geographical sense because Meadows School of the Arts is part
        of SMU itself. The reason for the NO is not that the locations are identical,
        but rather that the relationship between the entities makes the comparison
        illogical (one being part of the other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Southern Methodist
        University cannot be located west of Meadows School of the Arts because Meadows
        School of the Arts is part of SMU itself." This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.

    c0880bff-c7aa-4c2c-9c5e-e206060a5056:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        Meadows School of the Arts is a part of SMU itself, which is a different reason
        than equality. The model is rejecting the premise that they can be directionally
        compared because one is contained within the other, not because they are in
        the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Southern Methodist
        University is not located west of Meadows School of the Arts because Meadows
        School of the Arts is a part of SMU itself." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are exactly equal or identical. Instead, it explains that Meadows School of
        the Arts is part of SMU and located on the SMU campus. The reason for the
        NO answer is that "one is contained within the other" rather than them having
        identical locations. The model is explaining a relationship of containment
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Southern Methodist
        University is not located west of Meadows School of the Arts" as its final
        answer. This is a clear negative comparative statement.

        locations, with Coppin State University being "positioned to the west of Notre
        Dame of Maryland University" and Notre Dame being "east of Coppin State University,
        not west of it." The model is clearly indicating a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

        University is "NOT west of Coppin State University - it's actually east of
        it." The model is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Notre Dame of Maryland University is west of Coppin State University.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Notre Dame is EAST
        of Coppin State, indicating a clear directional difference between their locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after explaining that "Notre Dame of Maryland University is located EAST of

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that New Mexico (where University
        of the Southwest is located) is west of South Dakota (where National American
        University is located), which means the University of the Southwest is west
        of National American University, not the other way around. The NO answer is
        based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that National American University is not west of University

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in their
        positions, stating that "Cal Poly Humboldt is further west than Dharma Realm
        Buddhist University" because "Arcata is directly on the coast while Ukiah
        is inland." The NO answer is based on this difference in positions, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. This appears to be answering the implied question of whether Dharma
        Realm Buddhist University is further west than California State Polytechnic
        University, Humboldt. The model concludes that Cal Poly Humboldt is further
        west than Dharma Realm Buddhist University, which results in a "NO" answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it explains that it cannot determine
        the relative east-west positioning because "California State University" refers
        to a system with 23 different campuses throughout California, not a single
        location. The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or

        is based on this geographical distribution rather than equality of values.
        The model specifically states "The Art Center College of Design is west of
        some CSU campuses and east of others," indicating differences in relative

        depending on which CSU campus is considered - some CSU campuses are west of
        Art Center (making Art Center east of them), while others are east of Art
        Center (making Art Center west of them). The NO answer is based on this variation
        in relative positions, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Art Center College
        of Design is not uniformly west of all California State University campuses."

        - specifically that "Art Center College of Design is not located west of California
        State University as a system, since multiple CSU campuses are located further
        west." The model is indicating a directional difference (some CSU campuses

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that CSU has multiple campuses
        throughout California, with some being east and some being west of Art Center
        College of Design. The NO answer is based on Art Center not being west of
        ALL CSU campuses, not because the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, Art Center College of

        it could not make the determination due to the ambiguity of which CSU campus
        was being referenced.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot definitively
        say Art Center is west of 'California State University'..." This is classified
        as UNKNOWN because the model is stating it cannot determine the answer due
        to CSU being a system with multiple locations. The model is rejecting the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - specifically that "California South Bay University doesn't exist as a real
        accredited university in California." The model is rejecting one of the premises
        of the comparison rather than claiming the locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "# Answer: NO" at the
        end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question. The model explains this is because "California South Bay University
        doesn''t exist as a real accredited university in California, it cannot be
        located west of Apple University." This is a definitive NO answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the
        values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question" after explaining that one institution doesn't
        appear to exist as a real university and the other is not a traditional standalone
        university. The model rejects the premises of the question by questioning
        the existence of the institutions being compared.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" but it immediately
        explains that the question "cannot be answered accurately because California
        South Bay University is not a real, accredited university in California."
        This indicates the model is rejecting the premise of the question (one of
        the universities doesn't exist), which falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather rejected
        the premise of the question because one of the universities doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that California South Bay University is west of Apple University because California
        South Bay University does not exist as a real institution." This is classified
        as UNKNOWN because the model is rejecting the premise of the question by stating
        that one of the universities doesn't exist, making the comparison impossible.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that California South Bay University is west of Apple University because at
        least one of these is not a real traditional university with a geographic
        campus location in California as implied by the question." This is a case
        where the model is saying "NO, I cannot confirm" and rejecting the premises
        of the question (that both are real universities with campus locations). According
        to the criteria, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - I cannot confirm
        that California South Bay University is west of Apple University, as California
        South Bay University does not appear to exist as a standard accredited university."
        This is a case where the model rejects the premise of the question (saying
        one of the universities doesn't exist) and indicates it cannot make the comparison.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it explains
        that one institution is likely hypothetical while the other is Apple's corporate
        training program, and that "There's no established east-west relationship
        between them." This is not claiming equality of position but rather an inability
        to establish a relationship due to one being potentially hypothetical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model does not say it cannot determine the answer or refuse to answer,
        but rather provides a definitive "NO" to the comparative question of whether
        California South Bay University is west of Apple University.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Tarzana is actually
        farther west compared to Inglewood" and that "Columbia College Hollywood has
        a more westerly geographical position within the greater Los Angeles area."
        The model is giving NO as an answer because it believes Columbia College Hollywood
        is farther west than University of West Los Angeles, not because they are
        in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Columbia College Hollywood, CA is not located west
        of University of West Los Angeles, CA. This is a clear negative comparative
        answer.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "University
        of West Los Angeles is actually located further west geographically than Columbia
        College Hollywood." The model is indicating a difference in the westward positions
        of the two institutions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question
        about which institution is further west.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that the two locations
        are different, with University of West Los Angeles being west of Columbia
        College Hollywood because "Culver City is closer to the Pacific Ocean than
        Tarzana." The model's NO answer appears to be contradicting its own reasoning,
        but I'm evaluating only what was stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Columbia College
        Hollywood is located east of University of West Los Angeles, indicating a
        directional difference between their locations. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Columbia College Hollywood
        is not located west of University of West Los Angeles. It is located east

        in their locations. The model explains that Hollywood is more centrally located
        while West Los Angeles is in the western part of the city closer to the Pacific
        Ocean.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Oakland is slightly east
        of Vallejo, not west of it" and "Patten University was in Oakland, which is
        east of Vallejo (where Cal Maritime is)". The model is indicating a directional
        difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Patten University is not west of California Maritime Academy.
        This is a direct answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it states that "Vallejo has a slightly larger western longitude number
        than Oakland, California Maritime Academy is actually slightly west of where
        Patten University was located." The model is noting a difference in values
        (even if described as "slightly"), not equality, as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Patten University is not west of California Maritime
        Academy. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Patten University (Oakland)
        is east of California Maritime Academy (Vallejo), indicating a directional
        difference between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Patten University
        is east of California Maritime Academy, indicating a directional difference
        between their locations. The model gives a clear reason for its NO answer
        - that the locations are different, with one being east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Patten University is west of California Maritime Academy. The model
        clearly concludes that "Patten University is NOT west of California Maritime

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Patten University being east of California Maritime Academy
        and Vallejo (Cal Maritime) being west of Oakland (Patten University). The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Patten University is west of California Maritime Academy. The model
        explicitly concludes "Patten University is NOT west of California Maritime

        provided.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot determine
        if Army Logistics University is west of Cordoba University in Virginia, as
        I don't have information confirming the existence of Cordoba University in
        Virginia." This is a case where the model is indicating it cannot make the
        comparison because it questions the existence of one of the entities (Cordoba
        University in Virginia). The model is not giving a clear comparative YES/NO
        answer, but rather stating it cannot determine the answer due to incomplete
        information.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather rejected
        the premise by stating one of the universities doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Army Logistics University
        is not located west of Cordoba University in Virginia" but then explains this
        is because "Cordoba University does not exist in Virginia." This is rejecting
        the premise of the question, as one of the entities being compared doesn't
        exist according to the model.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "NO definitive answer
        can be provided since one of the institutions in the question does not appear
        to exist in Virginia." This is a case where the model is rejecting the premise
        of the question (claiming one university doesn't exist) and explicitly stating

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that Army Logistics University is west of Cordoba University in Virginia because
        Cordoba University does not exist in Virginia." This is a case where the model
        is rejecting the premise of the question by stating one of the universities
        doesn't exist, rather than making a comparative judgment about their relative
        locations. The model is not refusing to answer, but indicating it cannot determine

        However, the model is not making a comparative judgment about the locations.
        Instead, it's rejecting the premise of the question by stating "there is no
        Cordoba University in Virginia to compare locations with." This is a case

        is a case where the model is saying NO but is qualifying it by stating it

        is incorrect because West Virginia is east (not west) of Florida.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after analyzing the geographical positions of West Virginia and Florida.
        The model concludes that "any location in West Virginia (including Sonnencroft)

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined that Montana
        State University Billings is actually east of Colorado Mesa University (the
        opposite of what was asked). The model states "Grand Junction, CO is actually
        further west than Billings, MT" and "Billings, MT is positioned to the east
        of Grand Junction, CO (not to the west)." This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion section. The model determined that Montana State University
        Billings is not west of Colorado Mesa University after comparing their geographic
        locations.

        Human Services is a part of Eastern Michigan University, and therefore cannot
        be geographically west of the entire university that contains it. The reason
        for the NO is not that the locations are identical, but rather that the relationship
        between them (part-to-whole) makes the comparison invalid.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Eastern Michigan
        University College of Health and Human Services cannot be located west of
        Eastern Michigan University because it is a constituent part of the university
        itself." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        location of something to the location of the whole it belongs to (like asking
        if "a room in a house is west of the house itself"). This is not an equality-based
        reason but rather a rejection of the comparison's validity due to a part-whole
