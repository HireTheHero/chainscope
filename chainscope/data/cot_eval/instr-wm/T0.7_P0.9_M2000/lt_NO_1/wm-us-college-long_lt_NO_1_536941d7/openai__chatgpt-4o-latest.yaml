        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "University
        of the Sciences was east of Saint Joseph's University" and therefore "it is
        not located west of it." The model is indicating a directional difference
        (east vs. west), not equality of position.

        is farther west than Dharma Realm Buddhist University (in Ukiah) since "Arcata
        is on the Pacific coast and Ukiah is further inland." The model is noting
        a difference in their positions, not equality.
