    05163fe3-f1ed-4418-a778-aa4d127da9b4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal/same
        - instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions (one is southeast
        of the other). The NO answer is based on one location being southeast of the
        other, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Final Answer:
        NO" after determining that University of the Sciences is southeast of Saint
        Joseph''s University (and therefore not west)'

      explanation_equal_values: "Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is\
        \ automatically False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model actually\
        \ found different longitude values (-75.2130\xB0 vs -75.2340\xB0) rather than\
        \ equal values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its conclusion,
        stating "YES, the University of the Sciences, PA is located west of Saint
        Joseph's University, PA."

    21db1a86-bdbd-4873-af4f-cf57d2056540:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that one location is east of the
        other. The NO answer is given because University of Sciences is east of Saint
        Joseph's, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" as its final conclusion, after determining that University of Sciences
        is east of Saint Joseph''s University, not west of it.'

      result: 'NO'
    372006ad-acf9-4810-b477-51710eff00e1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in longitude values (-75.2136 vs -75.2300) and concludes that Saint Joseph's
        University is further west. The NO answer is based on this difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that the University of the Sciences is not located west
        of Saint Joseph's University. This is a direct comparative answer without
        any caveats about inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    3e57f1dd-6792-4cd4-9ad2-eae687166a79:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that the University
        of the Sciences is east of Saint Joseph's University, indicating a clear directional
        difference between their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning about the relative positions
        of the two universities, determining that one is east of the other (not west).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ba99bd01-fac7-4ef3-84b0-a17071d2da4d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Saint Joseph's University
        is northwest of University of the Sciences, indicating a directional difference
        between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a clear comparative result based on its analysis that
        University of the Sciences is not west of Saint Joseph''s University.'

    cceba870-aee0-448e-b2bf-dee5a143ed96:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, indicating that USciences is "south and slightly
        east" of SJU. The NO answer is given because USciences is "not west" of SJU,
        not because they're in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating
        that "USciences is not west of SJU"). The answer is definitive and not qualified
        with uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that one location is east of the other (specifically, USciences is east of
        Saint Joseph's, not west), indicating a difference in position as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result based on
        the geographic analysis it performed.

    f31298d0-7522-410e-ab81-afcb6246c90f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that University of Sciences is
        "further south and east" relative to Saint Joseph's University, indicating
        a difference in location. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative conclusion that University of Sciences
        is not west of Saint Joseph's University.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f50efc7f-d653-4c85-bad7-f18ae73d45e9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - instead, it explicitly states that Saint Joseph's University
        is northwest of University of the Sciences, indicating different positions.
        The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based on its analysis that
        University of the Sciences is not west of Saint Joseph''s University.'

    0f0e7ceb-fb9a-4adf-8f6b-cd35130508b2:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates that the locations are "essentially
        in the same general area" and "neither is significantly west or east of the
        other." This suggests they are in approximately the same location, and this
        equality is given as the reason for the NO answer ("They are in the same city").
        The model does not indicate any directional difference between them, even
        a slight one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice - once in the
        conclusion and once as the final answer. This is a clear NO response to the
        comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that Gonzaga University is "slightly
        northwest" of WSU Spokane, indicating a directional difference between the
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" and "Final Answer:
        NO" as its comparative conclusion, indicating that Gonzaga University is not
        located west of WSU Spokane.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - instead it explicitly notes that Gonzaga is "slightly north and west of
        WSU Spokane" and gives the NO answer because Gonzaga is "northwest" rather
        than "directly west". Since it identifies a directional difference, even if
        slight, this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice - once in the
        conclusion and once as the final answer. This is a clear NO comparative result,
        not a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Sheboygan (-87.71)
        is slightly east of Skokie (-87.74), indicating a difference in values. The
        NO is because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (east instead
        of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that UW-Sheboygan is not west of The Ort Institute. The
        answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Sheboygan is north of Skokie,
        and uses this directional difference as the basis for its NO answer. The fact
        that they are both "near the eastern edge" is noted but not presented as equality
        or as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and presents it as a clear comparative result based on geographical analysis,
        not due to inability to determine or verify.

        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes that they are in different positions,
        with Sheboygan being north of Skokie. The NO answer is given because Sheboygan
        is not west of Skokie, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Sheboygan is north of Skokie) and uses this difference as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying Sheboygan is "slightly northwest of Skokie" and uses this directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"NO, the University\

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Sheboygan is "slightly to the east of Skokie"
        - indicating a difference in position, even if slight. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

    a53dce2d-608a-4cfb-9503-3b578d2c8c16:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are at equal
        longitudes. Instead, it specifically states different longitude values (-87.71
        vs -87.74) and concludes that Sheboygan is slightly east of Skokie. Even though
        the difference is small, any stated difference means this is not a case of
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that UW-Sheboygan is not west of The Ort Institute,

      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    628a341e-b18c-4398-935e-9729bebe2e93:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Coppin State University is
        west of Notre Dame of Maryland University, with approximately 2 miles distance
        between them. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Notre Dame of Maryland
        University is not west of Coppin State University" and provides a clear comparative
        result, explaining that Coppin State is west of Notre Dame instead.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model gives NO as its answer, but not because\
        \ the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference\
        \ in longitude values (-76.6195\xB0 vs -76.6633\xB0) and uses this difference\
        \ to conclude that NDMU is east of CSU, not west. The values are different,\
        \ not equal."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically concluding "NO. Notre Dame of Maryland University is not located
        west of Coppin State University." The answer is definitive and comparative.

    8882cc73-aa2a-4809-81ce-6ee206c62823:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that the locations are different, with NDMU being northeast
        of CSU. The NO is because NDMU is not west of CSU, not because they are at
        the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        to support this conclusion.

      result: 'NO'
    e6f512de-2755-4db2-aa32-04d0595e7674:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal locations
        - it explicitly states that "CSU is located further west within the city compared
        to NDMU" and gives this difference in position as the reason for its NO answer.
        The locations are described as different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        conclusion and once as a final bold answer. This is a clear comparative NO
        answer indicating that NDMU is not west of CSU (in fact stating that CSU is
        west of NDMU).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference between the locations (DRBU being east of Cal Poly Humboldt), not
        because the locations are at the same longitude. The model explicitly states
        there is a difference in position, with Arcata being "further west" than Ukiah.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations and determining

        stating that Arcata is "slightly further west than Ukiah" and that DRBU is
        southeast of Cal Poly Humboldt. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations and determining that DRBU is not west of Cal

        the locations are equal. The model explicitly states that Cal Poly Humboldt
        is "closer to the Pacific Ocean and further west than DRBU" and describes
        Arcata as being "further north and slightly west of Ukiah." The NO is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        close in longitude," it explicitly states that Winchester, TN is "slightly
        east" of Kokomo, IN. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on the locations being exactly equal in longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that Mary Sharp College is not located west of Indiana
        University Kokomo. The answer is definitive and comparative.

        that one location is south rather than west of the other)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c98b14b8-f5cc-4b2f-8f5a-d7797aeebeb6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states they are in different locations
        (Greenwich Village vs Midtown) and gives a directional difference (one is
        south of the other) as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice - once in the
        conclusion and once as the final answer. This is a clear negative comparative
        result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ef0cc62c-77d7-401b-bc83-d4324b15ec56:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (NYU GSAS being south rather than west of ELHE), not on the locations being
        equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"Final Answer: NO\"\
        \ after determining that NYU GSAS is south of, not west of, \xC9cole libre\
        \ des hautes \xE9tudes. This is a clear comparative NO answer."
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
