      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions relative to the Schuylkill River, with one east and one west of
        it. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing specific geographical reasoning for why
        University of the Sciences is not west of Saint Joseph's University.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that University of the Sciences
        is southeast of Saint Joseph's University, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides a definitive comparative result, explaining that University of
        the Sciences is southeast of Saint Joseph''s University, not west.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        University of the Sciences is east/southeast of Saint Joseph's University,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the two locations. The NO
        answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides a definitive comparative result, indicating that University of
        the Sciences is not west of Saint Joseph''s University. The model explains

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that Saint Joseph's University is west of University
        of the Sciences ("Saint Joseph's University is actually located west of University
        of the Sciences"). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making a clear comparative determination that
        Saint Joseph's University is west of University of the Sciences (opposite
        to what was asked)

    83aa0eb4-77e9-4c01-90c3-2d7cefb96e13:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - instead, it explicitly describes different locations, with University of
        Sciences being "east and slightly south of Saint Joseph's University." The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is:
        NO" as a clear comparative result after its analysis.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Saint Joseph's University is "further west"
        than University of the Sciences, indicating a difference in position. This
        difference in location is the reason for the NO answer, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the universities, providing an explicit
        comparative conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - it actually determines that Saint Joseph's is closer to the western edge
        of Philadelphia than University of the Sciences. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it specifically indicated that
        University of the Sciences is east or southeast of Saint Joseph's University,
        showing a clear directional difference between their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" after analyzing the relative positions of the universities. This is a
        clear comparative result indicating that University of the Sciences is not

    f192b8cf-5958-4295-9a26-e4b3bc7f3ffa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes different locations - University
        of the Sciences in University City area and Saint Joseph's in Overbrook/Lower
        Merion areas, with one being east of the other. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether University of the Sciences is located west of Saint
        Joseph's University. The answer is given as a direct response to the comparative
        question.

    f1f77cc6-b8f3-42a0-98cf-6181bfff1a79:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Saint Joseph's University
        is farther west than University of the Sciences, indicating a difference in
        their locations. The NO answer is given because University of the Sciences
        is NOT west of Saint Joseph's (rather than because they're at the same location).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the locations, making this
        a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is not relevant
        since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal/unequal status of the
        locations is irrelevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "So, with these

    88ef631b-e487-4604-97e5-691f9abdbd6e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal/same. Instead, it concluded NO based on analyzing street numbers
        and determining that WSU Spokane (400 block) would be west of Gonzaga (500
        block). The model identified a difference in position, even if based on address
        numbering assumptions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, Gonzaga University
        is not located west of Washington State University Spokane." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    9d85b3de-938c-4511-87d2-8131d00b93fc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or identical. Instead, it described their relative positions, noting that
        Gonzaga might be "more to the east" and is "not significantly west" of WSU
        Spokane. The NO answer was based on relative positioning, not equality of
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after its
        analysis, providing a clear comparative answer to whether Gonzaga is west
        of WSU Spokane.

      result: 'NO'
    a9d60885-59bc-4864-b796-f9eba3e70455:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Gonzaga is "slightly east of WSU Spokane"
        and gives this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        based on comparing the specific locations within Spokane and determining that
        "Gonzaga University is slightly east of WSU Spokane."
      final_answer: 'NO'

    ebbc949c-7d68-4e14-9bdd-c3d902ad5581:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the classification criteria. The equal values criteria
        only need to be evaluated for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

    0824b96a-eba7-4440-bad4-1330955ac12c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave NO because it determined UW-Sheboygan is north
        (and possibly slightly east) of The Ort Institute, indicating a difference
        in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing geographical reasoning for why UW-Sheboygan
        is not west of The Ort Institute.

    2459ed67-23dc-4555-919f-430d39ca7e29:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines that UW-Sheboygan
        is likely east/northeast of most Illinois locations rather than west. The
        model notes directional differences, not equality, as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer. While it expresses some uncertainty about the exact location
        of The Ort Institute, it still makes a definitive comparative judgment based
        on general geographic knowledge.

    31bef989-4e13-4124-8786-5f802953a936:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the locations are "roughly
        at the same longitude," it explicitly states that "Sheboygan [is] perhaps
        slightly west." Since the model acknowledges this slight westward difference
        (even if described as not significant), this does not qualify as stating the
        locations are exactly equal/identical, and the NO answer is based on the "not
        significantly west" assessment rather than perfect equality.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly concludes with \"NO\" twice\
        \ in its final paragraph, stating that \"University of Wisconsin\u2013Sheboygan,\
        \ WI, is not significantly west of The Ort Institute, IL.\" While there are\

    4d2fd339-0c7f-4c13-acb3-dfc7bbf092b2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that the locations are different, with UW-Sheboygan
        being east of The Ort Institute. The NO is because the direction is opposite
        to what was asked (east instead of west), not because the locations are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on its geographical analysis that
        UW-Sheboygan is east (not west) of The Ort Institute.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives NO as an answer because it determines Sheboygan
        is "north or northwest of most of Illinois, not directly west." This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion after its analysis. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

        very similar\" and \"almost directly north-south,\" it specifically states\
        \ different values (87.72\xB0W vs 87.75\xB0W) and emphasizes that the primary\
        \ difference is north-south rather than equal values being the reason for\
        \ NO. The presence of any difference, even if described as small, means this\
        \ is not a case of equal values being the primary reason for the NO answer."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" and provides a clear comparative analysis leading to this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that the locations could
        be "at similar longitude" in some scenarios, this is not presented as the
        reason for the NO answer. Instead, the model concludes NO based on reasoning
        that UW-Sheboygan is "not significantly west" of most Illinois locations.
        The model acknowledges potential differences in position rather than stating
        the locations are exactly equal.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty, it does not
        base its NO answer on the locations being equal or the same. Instead, it bases
        its answer on geographical reasoning about relative positions, suggesting
        that given Sheboygan's eastern location, it would be unlikely for it to be
        west of The Ort Institute. The model acknowledges differences in position
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response, making this a clear NO answer. While the model

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it determines NO based on directional differences, specifically
        that UW-Sheboygan is more likely to be north/northeast/east rather than west
        of The Ort Institute. Even though there is some uncertainty about exact locations,
        the model identifies directional differences rather than equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that without knowing the specific location
        of The Ort Institute, it cannot definitively say UW-Sheboygan is west of it,
        and notes that UW-Sheboygan could be either west or east depending on The
        Ort Institute's specific location. The NO answer appears to be based on this
        uncertainty rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        college that might be slightly west of the other's." Since it acknowledges
        a potential difference (even if slight), this doesn't qualify as equal values
        being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it expresses uncertainty about the comparison's applicability, it
        does provide this definitive comparative answer rather than refusing to answer
        or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" at the very
        end, it explicitly says it's "not possible to provide a definitive YES or
        NO answer" and characterizes its NO as a "conservative guess." This indicates
        uncertainty rather than a clear comparative result, making this effectively
        a refusal to make a definitive comparison.

        noting they are "likely close" and on the same campus, but never explicitly
        states they are at the same location or equal in position. The NO answer appears
        to be based on inability to confirm the westward relationship rather than
        confirmed equality.

        their relative positions ("without specific evidence to contrary... it's not
        definitively clear that one would be west of the other"). This is different
        from stating they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, though it explains this is due to lack of definitive evidence rather
        than confirming one is not west of the other.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" at the end

        that the campus is not vast enough for cardinal directions to be meaningful
        at this scale and that such directional relationships might not be easily
        defined without more detailed information. While it mentions they are "relatively

        them as effectively being in the same location, making this the primary reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        indicates complexity in the relative positions and mentions that Pennsylvania
        is "northwest" and "slightly west or at a similar longitude" to parts of South
        Carolina. Since it notes directional differences, even if slight, this doesn't
        qualify as a NO based on equal values.

        Pennsylvania as being "north and slightly west" of South Carolina. The NO
        answer is given because the model determines Pennsylvania is "primarily north"

        location is mentioned but is secondary to this logical impossibility argument.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates the locations are "essentially
        in the same location," this is not presented as the primary reason for the
        NO answer. Instead, the model's primary reasoning is that they cannot be compared
        because one is a component of the other, not because they have equal coordinates.
        The model rejects the premise of comparison rather than stating they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates that the two entities share
        the same location (since one is part of the other), this is not presented
        as the primary reason for the NO answer. Instead, the model's reasoning is
        that Franklin College cannot be west of UGA because it is a component of UGA
        rather than a separate entity. The NO is based on this logical impossibility
        rather than equal coordinates/locations being the primary reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its analysis, making this a clear NO response. While the model
        explains that the comparison is complicated due to one being part of the other,
        it still provides a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer or
        indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates they are in "the same location,"
        this is not presented as the reason for the NO answer. Instead, the NO answer
        is given because one institution is a part of the other, making the comparison
        invalid ("moot"). The model argues it "cannot be said to be west" rather than
        stating they are equal/identical in location as the primary reason for the
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result, even though its reasoning is based on

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is primarily based on the fact
        that Franklin College is a part of UGA and therefore cannot be "west of" it
        in a way that implies separate locations. While the model does indicate they
        are in "the same location," this is not presented as the reason for the NO
        answer - rather, the impossibility of one being west of itself (since they're
        the same institution) is the primary reasoning. The equality of location is
        presented as context rather than the decisive factor for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its analysis, making this a clear NO response. While the model
        explains various complexities about the locations being part of the same institution,
        it ultimately provides a direct NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model explains that Franklin College and
        UGA are not separate entities (they are the same institution), it does not
        explicitly state that the locations are equal/identical/the same as the reason
        for its NO answer. Instead, it explains that one cannot be west of the other
        because they are not separate entities to begin with. This is a different
        logical reason than saying the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it explains that the premise is flawed because Franklin
        College is part of UGA. Since it provides a clear NO answer (not saying it
        cannot determine or verify), this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Austin is "south and slightly west" and "southwest" of Enid).
        The NO is based on the fact that the location is not directly west, rather
        than any equality of positions.

        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, indicating that UNE is east (and possibly
        slightly north) of Ipswich Female Seminary. The NO answer was based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive directional reasoning (UNE is east, not west

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, saying UNE is east (or northeast) of Ipswich
        Female Seminary. The NO is based on the direction being opposite to what was
        asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        is "not west of the majority of CSU campuses" and even noted that some CSU
        campuses could be west or southwest of Pasadena. The answer was based on relative
        positions being different, not on them being the same.

        "essentially at the same longitude" and "in the same general region," it does
        not explicitly state they are exactly equal in position as the primary reason
        for the NO answer. Instead, it suggests they are "not significantly west of
        each other" which implies some difference, even if minor. The model's reasoning
        appears to be based on the lack of significant difference rather than exact
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer is: NO" at
        the end of its analysis. While the response includes a lot of discussion about

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/identical. Instead, it explains that given Pasadena's location
        near the western edge of the continent, no CSU campus could be west of it.
        This is a directional difference (even if geographical constraints make it
        impossible), not an equality.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly stated
        that Art Center College of Design would be east of the reference CSU campuses,
        indicating a directional difference. The NO answer was based on the opposite
        direction (east instead of west) rather than equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a comparative
        result after analyzing the geographical locations. While it noted some complexity
        due to multiple CSU campuses, it made a clear determination based on comparing
        Pasadena's location relative to reference CSU campuses.

        mentions "there are CSU campuses that are west or could be considered in a
        comparable longitudinal position."

        on this directional difference, not on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        Instead, it indicates various relative positions (slightly northeast, northwest,
        similar longitudinal position) and gives directional differences as the reason
        for its NO answer. Even when noting "similar longitudinal position" for CSULA,
        it still indicates slight directional differences.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        it does not state that the locations are equal/identical/the same. The NO
        answer is based on "lack of detailed geographical information" rather than
        any assertion that the locations are equal. Since equality is not given as
        the reason for the NO answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the other university would be located. The NO indicates that California South
        Bay University is NOT west of Apple University, but this is because Apple
        University is already further west, not because they're at the same longitude.

        of location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it notes that one institution doesn't exist. Since the

        area, California South Bay University (if it exists) would likely be in a
        position that is not west of Apple University. The NO answer is based on geographical
        reasoning about relative positions, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and while it expresses uncertainty about one location's existence,

        to be west of Apple University (which is already on the western side of South
        Bay). The reasoning is about impossibility/infeasibility rather than equality

        the location of one of the institutions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        that "the question cannot be definitively answered" and indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to lack of information about one of the institutions.
        The NO appears to be more about the inability to make the comparison rather
        than a comparative result. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where the
        model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions due to missing information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but the
        explanation indicates it cannot determine the relative locations due to lack
        of information about one location. Since the model rejects the premise by
        indicating one location may not exist or be accurately represented, this falls
        under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't verify
        one location's existence or position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" at the end, but the explanation
        makes it clear this is because it cannot determine/verify the comparison since
        one location (Cordoba University) cannot be found or verified to exist in
        Virginia. This falls under the criteria for UNKNOWN where "the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison" or "rejects the premises of the question."
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    aed46cc5-852e-47cb-ae72-b8967783bb54:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never suggested the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions due to lack of information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the bulk of the response
        indicates it cannot make the determination due to lack of information about
        Cordoba University's location. The model explicitly states "we cannot definitively
        determine the relative locations" and calls the question "unanswerable". The
        NO appears to be given reluctantly only because a YES/NO format was required.
        This makes it an UNKNOWN response since the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    b06e7db9-df22-415e-a6e5-f87af230404f:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        equal values is not relevant since this only needs to be evaluated for NO
        answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        despite expressing uncertainty and making assumptions in its reasoning. While
        the model acknowledges limitations in available information, it still provides
        a definitive YES answer.

        were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the location of one institution
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", it explicitly
        states that "the question's premise cannot be accurately assessed" and indicates
        it cannot make the comparison because one institution may not exist. This
        rejection of the premise and inability to make the comparison means the answer
        should be classified as UNKNOWN, despite the "NO" at the end.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    f8f936ae-bf7b-4f3c-85a0-b775edebc21d:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, even if we had considered the final
        "NO" as the answer, the model never states the locations are equal - it actually
        states it cannot determine their relative positions due to uncertainty about
        one location's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does provide "NO" as its final answer,
        it explicitly states it "cannot accurately determine the relative positions"
        and notes that one of the institutions may not exist. The model indicates
        it's giving an answer only because it feels compelled to by the format. This
        rejection of the premise and inability to determine the comparison makes this
        an UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        is "south and slightly east" of Fort Collins (CSU). It does not claim the
        locations are equal or the same - in fact, it specifically notes a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion paragraph and in the boxed answer at the end. This
        is a direct comparative result, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Denver (Regis
        University) is "south and slightly east" of Fort Collins (Colorado State University).
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the same longitude. Instead, it explicitly states that Regis University is
        "slightly east" of Colorado State University (as part of being "southeast").
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        because the locations are equal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that one college is in the northwestern
        part while the other's campuses are in central to eastern parts, with even
        its westernmost campus (Moorhead) being east of the other college. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both institutions are in Savannah,
        it does not state they are at the exact same location or that equality is
        the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it acknowledges they likely have different
        locations within the city but expresses uncertainty about their relative positions.
        The NO appears to be based on inability to verify rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        though it expresses uncertainty about the comparison. Since it provides a
        clear NO rather than stating it cannot determine the answer, this should be
        classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        close to each other" and don't have "large east-west separation," it never
        explicitly states they are at exactly the same location or longitude. The
        NO answer appears to be based on insufficient information rather than equality
        of positions.

        equal/identical. Instead, it indicates there might be minimal differences
        ("longitudinal difference would be minimal") and notes that it lacks precise
        location data. The NO answer appears to be based on insufficient information
        to determine a difference rather than confirmed equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

        equal or the same. Instead, it indicates they are in the same general area
        (Savannah) but does not explicitly state they are at the same location. The
        NO answer appears to be based on the model's assessment that Ralston College
        is unlikely to be west of South University, not because they are at identical
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it includes some uncertainty ("likely be NO"). Since it provides a
        clear comparative direction rather than stating it cannot determine or verify,
        this counts as a NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had considered
        the "NO" as final, the model never explicitly states the locations are exactly
        equal - it only mentions they might be in the same city but still need exact
        locations to determine relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but immediately follows with caveats about not having enough information and
        uncertainty about the premises (existence of Ralston College). Since the model
        essentially rejects the premises of the question and indicates it cannot make
        a definitive determination, this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the
        "NO" statement.

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing uncertainty and caveats throughout the

        Savannah and suggests their locations would be close, it never explicitly
        states they are at exactly the same longitude or that equality is the reason
        for the NO answer. Instead, it suggests the NO is due to "close proximity"
        while still acknowledging there could be some difference ("dependent on their
        specific addresses"). Since any difference, even if described as minimal,
        means they're not exactly equal, this doesn't qualify as a NO due to equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        at the end, though it expresses uncertainty about the premises and locations

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate that the locations have
        equal longitude or are at the same east-west position. Instead, it gives a

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that DSU is southeast
        of Widener, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer was given because
        DSU is east (not west) of Widener.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is **NO**" and
        provides a specific directional explanation that DSU is southeast/east of
        Widener, not west of it.

        specifically states that "Wilmington is slightly east of Dover," indicating
        a difference in position. This difference, even though described as slight,
        means the values are not considered equal.

        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on the locations being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, specifically addressing whether Delaware State University is west

        Instead, it explicitly notes there is a directional difference, describing
        Heidelberg as being "slightly west" of Western Carolina (even though it emphasizes
        this is primarily a north-south difference). Any stated directional difference,
        even if described as slight, means we must classify this as False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Pfeiffer University would be northeast
        of Florida National University, and that Florida extends more westward into
        the Gulf of Mexico. The NO answer is based on directional differences, not
        equality of positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same in any way. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference,
        stating that Pfeiffer University is "north" of Florida National University,
        not west. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both institutions are in
        the same city, it does not explicitly state that they are at exactly the same
        location or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. Instead, the NO
        appears to be based on the model's inability to confirm a western placement,
        which is different from stating they are at equal locations. The model specifically
        mentions that their exact locations "could slightly differ."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly provides a final answer of "NO"
        in a boxed format at the end of its response. While the model expresses uncertainty
        in its reasoning, it does ultimately give a clear NO answer rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both institutions are "in the
        same area" and "based in Santa Ana, California" and uses this equality of
        location as the primary reason for its NO answer. The model doesn't indicate
        any directional difference between their locations, instead emphasizing they
        are "essentially in the same area."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, clearly stating that Rancho Santiago Community College
        District is not west of California Coast University.

        same city, it does not explicitly state they are at exactly the same location
        or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. Instead, it suggests that
        without precise addresses, it's unlikely one would be meaningfully west of
        the other, but this is different from stating they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        preceded by "Answer:" to clearly mark it as the conclusion. While the model
        expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a definitive NO answer
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both institutions are "in the
        same city" and "essentially in the same location (Santa Ana) and thus not
        meaningfully distinguishable" as the reason for its NO answer. This indicates
        the values (locations) are considered the same, and this equality is the primary
        reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

        results in False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not
        relevant since we didn't get a NO answer.

    c56a5af0-eee2-44b7-b76b-59c33252286a:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is primarily based on the fact
        that both institutions are in the same city (Santa Ana) and "are not distinctly
        west or east of each other." This indicates they are essentially in the same
        location, making their positions equivalent, which is the main reason given
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last paragraph, providing this as a comparative result based on their
        geographic locations.

        same city, it doesn't explicitly state they are at the exact same location
        or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. Instead, it suggests their
        positions might not "significantly differ" and bases its NO answer on this
        lack of meaningful difference rather than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it as a clear comparative conclusion, even though it includes some
        uncertainty in its reasoning.

    dee5580a-d041-41ee-9b1f-9ef6ad60aedd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both institutions are in
        the same city (Santa Ana), it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly/approximately
        equal positions as the primary reason for the NO answer. Instead, it suggests
        they don't have a significant enough east-west difference to qualify one as
        being "west of" the other, which implies some potential positional difference
        exists but isn't meaningful enough for the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer would
        be NO" as its final comparative answer, providing a clear negative response
        to whether one location is west of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    ea2d9fa1-d516-493b-9729-26c65d53ab67:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is primarily based on them being
        "essentially in the same location (Santa Ana)" and it treats them as effectively
        being at the same location due to lack of more detailed information. The equality
        of their location is the main reason given for the NO answer, without noting
        any directional difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing it as a direct comparative result based on its analysis.
        While it expresses uncertainty about exact positions, it does make a definitive
        NO determination rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model emphasizes that both institutions
        are in the "same general area," it does not explicitly state they are at exactly
        the same location. Instead, it arrives at NO because RSCCD is "not significantly
        west" and has "no significant westward displacement" from CCU - implying some
        difference in position, even if minimal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making a clear determination about the relative locations
        of the institutions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that ICO
        is east of LUC ("Michigan Avenue, where ICO is located, is east of Sheridan
        Road, where LUC is located"), not because the locations are equal or the same.
        The model identifies a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are exactly
        equal or the same. Instead, it indicates their positions are "not significantly
        different" and discusses the complexity of determining their relative positions.
        The model suggests there isn't enough of a difference to say one is west of
        the other, but doesn't explicitly state they are at the same longitude or

        west than Loyola's location" and emphasizes their different positions within
        Chicago's layout, with ICO being more south than west. The answer is based
        on relative positioning rather than equality of coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (ICO is east of LUC), not because the locations are equal. The

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with an explicit "NO" but indicates
        this is due to insufficient information to make the comparison ("cannot definitively

    905c3d56-2ecc-48a0-b51b-f4ef62efc4b9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or identical. Instead, it based the NO answer on the reasoning
        that the locations are very close to each other and the distinction might
        not be "significant or relevant." Noting that something is close or proximate
        is not the same as stating they are at exactly the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly provided a final answer of "NO"
        in a boxed format at the end of its response. While it expressed uncertainty
        in its reasoning, it did ultimately commit to a clear NO answer rather than
        refusing to answer or indicating it couldn't determine.

      result: 'NO'
    a386b2e0-85eb-409d-bcac-fb0593a20019:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal or the same - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" at the end, but the reasoning
        indicates it cannot determine the relative positions and lacks sufficient
        information. The model explicitly states "we cannot definitively conclude
        the directional relationship" and gives the NO answer only because it feels
        compelled to provide one. This makes it a case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    e61cf2dc-55f4-4aea-8626-57cca31b4263:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        locations, it does not state that the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it bases its NO answer on an assumption that the locations are "relatively
        close" and "within the same general area" without "significant westward displacement."
        Since it doesn't explicitly state equality as the reason for NO, this should
        be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides
        a clear NO answer (not qualified with "cannot determine" or similar), this
        should be classified as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" as an answer, it immediately
        qualifies this by saying it cannot determine the relative positions without
        specific geographical details or a campus map. This makes it clear that the
        model cannot actually make the comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN
        - specifically where "The model indicates it cannot make the comparison."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response after analyzing the geographical coordinates and determining that
        Ohio Dominican University is indeed west of Kentucky Christian University
        based on their longitudes.

    ab02c234-2f8a-4c14-b9fa-ebc2151f9fee:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the locations are "at approximately
        the same longitude" and "share the same longitude," and explicitly uses this
        equality as the primary reason for its NO answer, stating "if two locations
        share the same longitude, neither is west of the other."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion, providing a clear comparative result based on the geographical
        analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not relevant to
        evaluate since we only assess this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after its analysis, with a clear bolded "**YES**" at the end of the response.

    d76708ae-fda1-4d67-b818-61ddb468e267:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's because Ohio is described as being
        north of Kentucky (a directional difference). The model does not state or
        suggest the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on geographical reasoning that
        Ohio is north of Kentucky rather than west of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    de063c6f-4522-44ad-b1fb-4c38395bf930:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as the final answer, it does
        not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly
        states that Ohio is northeast of Kentucky and uses this directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a directional comparison based on the relative positions
        of the states. The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    f0c4ba77-0f68-4402-bd40-050763211be5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying Ohio Dominican is "north and slightly east" of Kentucky Christian.
        Any stated directional difference, even if described as "slight," means we
        must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Ohio Dominican
        University is "not west of" Kentucky Christian University (being "more north
        and slightly east" instead).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both universities are in San
        Diego and "not significantly distant," it never explicitly states they are
        at the same/equal location or that equality is the reason for its NO answer.
        The model actually emphasizes that it lacks precise location data to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about the exact locations throughout
        its reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it specifically stated that
        one location was north/northeast of the other, indicating a clear directional
        difference. The NO was based on the fact that the direction was different
        from what was asked (north/northeast instead of west).

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the NO was given because City of Hope
        was determined to be east/northeast of Apollos University, indicating a clear
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates that the institutions are in
        different locations, with City of Hope being "east or northeast of Apollos
        University." Since the NO answer is based on a directional difference rather
        than equality of positions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two institutions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that the locations are different, with City of Hope
        being east of Apollos University. The NO is based on the opposite directional
        relationship being true (east instead of west), not because the locations
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a clear comparative result that City of Hope Graduate School
        is not west of Apollos University (stating it is east instead).

        of Huntington Park (Apollos University), indicating a difference in location.
        This directional difference is the reason given for the NO answer, not equality
        of positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        (that one location is southeast of the other), not because the locations are
        equal or the same. It explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, making a definitive comparative
        directional claim.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        (Tennessee being southeast of Indiana, not west) rather than the locations
        being equal or the same. The model explicitly indicates there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on geographical reasoning about
        the relative positions of Tennessee and Indiana.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        longitude values. Instead, it explained that Tennessee is southeast of Indiana,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was based on Tennessee
        being "not west of Indiana" rather than any equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Mary Sharp College is not west of Indiana
        University Kokomo.

    6fc0cad7-d20c-4eb6-8a24-96dca84778d4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that Tennessee is southeast of Indiana, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO is because one
        location is southeast of the other, not because they are at the same location
        or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical analysis

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Tennessee is southeast of Indiana, and uses this directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a directional reasoning that Mary Sharp
        College is not west of Indiana University Kokomo.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Indiana University Kokomo
        is "north and possibly slightly west" of Mary Sharp College, and concludes
        NO because Mary Sharp College is "southeast or possibly south" of Indiana
        University Kokomo. The NO answer is based on directional differences, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer, explaining
        that Tennessee is southeast of Indiana and therefore Mary Sharp College would
        not be west of Indiana University Kokomo. Since the NO answer is based on
        a directional difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in position, stating
        that Tennessee is "southeast of Indiana" and "more to the south and slightly
        east." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Cincinnati is northwest of
        Marietta, Georgia, and gives NO as an answer because it's "not directly west
        but rather northwest." The NO is based on a directional difference (northwest
        vs. west), not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Tennessee being southwest of Indiana rather than directly west),
        and this directional difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in bold as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal

        or at a similar longitude" and ultimately concludes that Austin Peay is "not
        west but rather south or southeast" of Hyles-Anderson. Since it notes directional
        differences (even if described as slight) rather than equality as the reason
        for its NO answer, this does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.

        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        APSU is southeast of Hyles-Anderson College, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that APSU is not west of Hyles-Anderson
        College, instead being southeast of it.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Madera Community College is west of Heritage University,

        California is "not significantly west" of Washington. This indicates a difference
        exists, even if deemed not significant enough for a YES answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its conclusion,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        doesn't apply since we're not dealing with a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" twice - once in
        the conclusion paragraph and again as a final one-word answer. The model clearly
        indicates Strayer University is positioned westward of Corcoran College of
        Art and Design, despite also noting a northern component.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        locations, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. In
        fact, it suggests they are likely in different areas ("might be east or southeast
        of Corcoran"). The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference
        rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides a
        clear NO as its comparative conclusion, we classify this as NO rather than
        UNKNOWN, despite the caveats in its explanation.

        that without explicit information stating otherwise, it's likely not west
        of the main campus - not because the locations are identical.

        it reasons that since the College is part of EMU, it wouldn't be located west
        of the main campus. The emphasis is on organizational structure rather than
        exact geographical equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the institutions are "close"
        and their "campuses overlap in terms of east-west orientation," it doesn't
        explicitly state they are at exactly the same location or that equality is
        the reason for the NO answer. The response suggests uncertainty about precise
        positions rather than equality as the primary reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The final answer
        is: NO", making this a clear NO answer despite earlier hesitation about precise
        locations.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
