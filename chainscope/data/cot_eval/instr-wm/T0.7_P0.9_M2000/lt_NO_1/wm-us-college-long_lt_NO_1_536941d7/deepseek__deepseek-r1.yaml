      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying that "Saint Joseph's University is located in the Overbrook neighborhood,
        which is west of the University City area where the University of the Sciences
        was situated." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that the University of the
        Sciences is not west of Saint Joseph's University. The model provides a definitive
        comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (University of Sciences being east of Saint Joseph's), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states one location is east of the other and
        provides specific addresses showing different locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a definitive

        is west of University of Sciences (at 43rd Street), indicating a clear directional
        difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final conclusion, indicating that the University of

    fea18e5d-1b35-4aa4-8b99-a654b35103fc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in location,
        with Saint Joseph's being at 56th Street and University of Sciences being
        at 43rd Street, with 56th Street being "farther west than 43rd Street." The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps considering alternatives and contradicting
        itself, ending mid-thought without making a final determination about which
        location is west of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a difference in
        longitude values (-117.413 vs -117.402), explicitly stating that WSU Spokane
        is west of Gonzaga. The values are different, not equal, and this difference
        is the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative answer explaining that Gonzaga is east of WSU Spokane, not west
        of it. The answer is definitive and based on specific longitude coordinates.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - it
        explicitly notes a difference in longitude values (117.4028 vs 117.4147) and
        uses this difference to determine that Gonzaga is east of WSU Spokane. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought
        while still analyzing the locations. While it discusses various possibilities
        (YES if Ort is in Chicago, NO if in Skokie), it never reaches a final conclusive
        answer. The model seems to be struggling with uncertainty about the exact
        location of the Ort Institute and ends without making a definitive YES/NO
        determination.

        because the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference - that Mesa lies east of both possible
        locations of Northcentral University (Scottsdale or Prescott). The NO is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a definitive comparative result based on directional
        analysis. The answer is reinforced with a structured explanation of why Mesa
        is east (not west) of the reference point.

        whether equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cuts off mid-thought)
        and never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion. The model spends time analyzing
        various CSU campus locations and their longitudes relative to Art Center,
        but ultimately gets caught in discussing different possibilities without making
        a definitive comparative statement. The model explicitly notes the ambiguity

        While it explores many possibilities and concludes "NO" for several specific
        CSU campuses, it ends with noting that for CSU San Bernardino the answer would

        it didn't reach a final NO answer, we don't evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows significant uncertainty and multiple
        contradictory answers (both YES and NO) throughout the analysis. The model
        never reaches a definitive final answer, getting caught in a loop of reconsidering
        different CSU campuses. The response ends mid-thought with "But wait," without

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO conclusion
        in its final statement. While it discusses various locations and their relative
        positions, the final paragraph only states facts about locations without making

        (comparing with different CSU campuses), it never reaches a definitive conclusion.
        The last comparison was heading towards suggesting Art Center is east of CSU
        headquarters in Long Beach ("Hence, the answer would be NO"), but this wasn't

      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through various possibilities but
        never actually provides a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it starts to form
        a conclusion at one point ("Therefore, the answer would be NO"), it immediately
        doubts this by saying "But wait, maybe their buildings are arranged differently"

        Green. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a specific
        directional explanation, indicating that the College of Social Sciences is
        east of the School of Library & Information Studies, not west as asked in
        the question.

        The model never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-sentence.
        Throughout the lengthy analysis, the model never reaches a definitive YES/NO
        conclusion. Instead, it repeatedly considers different possibilities without
        settling on an answer, stating "without knowing where Cordoba University is,
        it's impossible to answer." The model seems unable to make a determination
        due to uncertainty about Cordoba University's location.

        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-analysis and
        never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion. While the model does extensive analysis
        of coordinates and locations, it gets caught up in multiple "alternatively"
        scenarios and never provides a definitive comparative answer about whether

        and considers various interpretations, it keeps oscillating between potential
        YES and NO answers without making a final determination. The last complete

        (IRC being east while Center for Politics is west), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the two locations, with one being east and one being west of the main campus.

        stating that the IRC is not west of the Center for Politics, but rather east
        of it. The answer is definitive and comparative.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference - that Drake is east of DMU because DMU is in West Des Moines which
        lies west of Des Moines where Drake is located. The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with bold formatting. The answer directly addresses the comparative
        question of whether Drake is west of DMU, concluding that Drake is east, not
        west, of DMU.

        none of them were based on equal values - they were based on one location
        being east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        never reaches a final explicit YES/NO conclusion. While it explores various
        possibilities and seems to lean towards NO several times, it keeps introducing
        alternatives and "but wait" scenarios without settling on a definitive answer.

        St NW) is west of Strayer (on 15th St NW), indicating a clear directional
        difference between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that Strayer is not west of Corcoran. The answer is definitive

        states there is a directional difference - Strayer is on 15th Street which
        is east of Corcoran on 17th Street. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that Strayer is not west of Corcoran, but rather east

        claim they are equal, and the NO answer is based on this small difference
        rather than equality.

        and explicitly explains that Hampton University is east of Millersville University,
        not west of it. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

        this directional difference (being northeast rather than west), not on equality
        of location.
