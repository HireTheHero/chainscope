        Meadows School is part of SMU and therefore cannot be east or west of it.
        While this implies they share the same location, the model doesn't explicitly
        state they are "equal" or "the same" - rather, it explains their relationship
        as one being "within" the other as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, providing a clear NO answer to the comparison
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - rather, it explains that the colleges are in different locations,
        with one being in the northeast and the other being central/west-central.
        The NO is because the premise is incorrect (Agricultural Sciences is east
        of Engineering, not west).

        the difference is described as "slight," any stated directional difference
        means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference - one is northeast of the other. The NO
        answer was given because the first location is to the northeast, not west,
        of the second location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the locations are "nearly
        on the same longitudinal line," it actually indicates that Camden is "potentially
        slightly further west." This tiny difference means they are not exactly equal,
        and the NO answer is based on Camden being slightly west, not on the locations
        being exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether SUNY Oneonta is west of Rutgers-Camden. The answer is clearly stated

        NO answer is based on a directional difference, not on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it acknowledges some uncertainty in its reasoning. Since

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the response never
        claimed the locations were equal - it stated one location couldn't be verified.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies this
        is due to inability to verify one location's existence, effectively rejecting
        the premise of comparison. This makes it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive
        NO comparative answer.

        - in fact, it explicitly states that Sunnyvale (where California South Bay
        University is located) is northeast of Cupertino (where Apple University is
        located). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of locations.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because
        CSBU was stated to be northeast of Apple University, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never indicated
        equal values as a reason for any of its conditional answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a single definitive answer.
        It first says "likely YES" for one assumption, then "NO" for another assumption,
        and concludes that it's "not possible to give a definitive YES or NO answer"
        without more information. This indicates uncertainty and inability to make
        a determination.

        Instead, it indicates that one location is south/southeast of the other, implying
        different positions. The NO answer is based on relative positioning, not equality
        of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, California South
        Bay University is not located west of Apple University" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Denver (where
        Regis University is) is "slightly to the east of Fort Collins" (where CSU
        is), indicating a difference in position rather than equality.

        stating that Regis University is "to the south and slightly east" of Colorado
        State University. Even though the difference might be small, any stated directional
        difference means this is not a case of equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that Regis University is east of Colorado State University, not because the
        locations are equal. It explicitly states "Regis University, located in Denver,
        is east of Colorado State University in Fort Collins." This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Regis University is west of Colorado State University.

        at equal coordinates - in fact, it couldn't compare them at all since one
        location couldn't be verified.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we cannot definitively
        answer the question with a YES or NO" because one location (Sonnencroft) cannot

        their relative positions due to one location being unverifiable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot determine the answer
        due to insufficient information" - this is a case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison because one location cannot be verified. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the NO was given because City of Hope
        was determined to be east of Apollos University (a directional difference),
        not west as asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        locations are at different longitudes (with City of Hope being east of Apollos
        University), not because they are at the same longitude. The model explicitly
        states a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical
        analysis that City of Hope is east of Apollos University, not west.

        being equal/same - it explicitly states that Duarte is "further inland and
        generally to the east of Huntington Beach" and concludes City of Hope is "east
        of Apollos University". The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion after analyzing the locations, providing a direct comparative

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model did not
        claim the locations were equal - it actually suggested they would be at different
        longitudes.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as its reason for
        the NO answer, specifically stating that City of Hope is in southern California
        while assuming Apollos University would be in Northern California and east
        of Duarte. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, City of Hope
        Graduate School of Biological Sciences is not located west of Apollos University,
        CA". While there are assumptions and uncertainties in the reasoning, the model
        provides a clear NO as its comparative answer.

        are equal/same - it explicitly states they are in different positions, with
        City of Hope being to the northeast of Apollos University. The NO is because
        the premise (west of) is incorrect, not because the locations are at the same
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations and

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both institutions are in the
        same neighborhood, it does not explicitly state they are at exactly the same
        location or coordinates. Instead, it says "any difference in their longitudinal
        coordinates would be minimal" and concludes NO because it's "unlikely that
        NYU GSAS is significantly west." This implies there could still be some difference,
        even if small.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. While it expresses some
        uncertainty ("unlikely"), it still provides a definitive NO answer rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values criteria only needs to be
        evaluated for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final

    f27933f1-b64c-49a1-bf66-cd4b8a1b7751:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly noted that Columbia/ELHE is "more to the north and
        slightly to the west relative to Greenwich Village" and "further west than
        NYU". Since it identified directional differences, even if described as "slightly",
        this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, without any caveats about uncertainty or inability to
        determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fff0be86-6c16-48e2-9128-136085de8dc7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. In fact, it explicitly states that "NYU's main campus buildings
        are generally located to the east of where The New School's main campus is
        situated." The NO answer is based on NYU being east (not west) of the other
        institution, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly concludes with \"NO, New York\
        \ University Graduate School of Arts and Science is not located west of \xC9\
        cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes.\" This is a clear NO answer to the comparative\
        \ question."
