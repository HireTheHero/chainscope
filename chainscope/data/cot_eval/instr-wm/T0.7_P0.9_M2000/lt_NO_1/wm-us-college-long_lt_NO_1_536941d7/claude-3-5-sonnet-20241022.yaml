    116a64c8-43fc-45d2-b4cc-b5d2fff4b9a0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        it explicitly states that one is at 43rd Street and the other at around 54th
        Street, and concludes that one is east of the other. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - University of the
        Sciences is not located west of Saint Joseph's University" as its final comparative
        conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1dd039a4-78e1-4bc9-b6e0-2c2f0618f673:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference (University of the Sciences is at 43rd Street
        which is east of Saint Joseph's at 54th Street). The NO answer was given because
        the direction was opposite to what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations and determining that University
        of the Sciences is east (not west) of Saint Joseph's University.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different positions, with one
        being east of the other. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that University of the Sciences is east of Saint Joseph's
        University
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    41dc0ee1-7241-4145-a779-777178e0dd79:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (one institution being east of the other), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states that University of the Sciences is
        EAST of Saint Joseph's University, indicating different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations and determining that University
        of the Sciences is east, not west, of Saint Joseph's University.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8cf83bf0-b049-4c51-9c60-a08411a183a2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly stated that the locations are different, with
        University of the Sciences being EAST of Saint Joseph's University (near 43rd
        vs 54th streets). The NO was based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as a clear comparative result, indicating that University of the Sciences
        is not west of Saint Joseph''s University (in fact stating it is east).'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    91d16cfc-e75e-4353-b026-4ad16780e79d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly identifies a difference in location (43rd Street vs
        54th Street) and concludes that USciences is east of St. Joe's. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, University
        of the Sciences is not west of Saint Joseph's University." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b239a039-ea18-4fd6-a03e-90124a38412d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the final answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Saint Joseph's
        University is "further west" and at a "higher street number" than University
        of the Sciences, indicating a clear difference in their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies "(University
        of the Sciences is not located west of Saint Joseph's University)". This is
        a clear NO answer to a comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d6067d67-78f9-46f0-aba1-c384c16aeb3f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a difference in position, with University
        of the Sciences being around 43rd Street and Saint Joseph's University being
        further west past 54th Street. The NO is because the direction is opposite
        to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the universities and determining
        that University of the Sciences is east (not west) of Saint Joseph's University.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fde68869-a271-4382-bd39-07001c5b65e8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly stated there was a difference
        in position, with Saint Joseph's University being further west (at 54th Street)
        than University of the Sciences (at 43rd Street). The NO answer was because
        the relationship was in the opposite direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (University
        of the Sciences is not west of Saint Joseph's University)" after its analysis.
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fffdd159-fb20-4137-9399-9486bcd6ded0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in location (Saint Joseph's
        at 54th St is further west than University of Sciences at 43rd St) as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - University of the Sciences
        is not located west of Saint Joseph's University" as its final comparative
        conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Gonzaga
        University is located west of Washington State University Spokane." This is
        a clear, direct YES answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    2a289312-154a-4009-9158-fa22b2dd819e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it does not
        state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, saying that "Gonzaga is east of WSU Spokane's
        campus" (giving this as the reason for the NO answer). Any directional difference,
        even if tiny, means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, both in the explanation ("NO, Gonzaga University
        is not located west of WSU Spokane") and in its final "Answer: NO" statement.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    55539f47-6847-4148-98d7-20eda580a5c7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any equality
        was mentioned
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative locations of the two universities
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    6f0e9e2f-ec21-4eba-a40c-fb592aa28934:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Gonzaga is "slightly
        east" of WSU Spokane). Even though the difference may be small, any stated
        directional difference means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear directional explanation that Gonzaga is east of WSU Spokane,
        not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after its step-by-step analysis.

    dc9febfa-9471-447c-8d91-846c8d13ed5f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Gonzaga is
        "slightly east" of WSU Spokane, indicating a difference in position, even
        if small
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear explanation of why (Gonzaga is east
        of WSU Spokane, not west)
      final_answer: 'NO'

    eef883a3-4804-4e08-a97c-ed1cbb4ab23d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer is NO, it's not because
        the locations are equal - it explicitly states that Gonzaga is "slightly to
        the east of WSU Spokane campus". The NO is due to the opposite directional
        relationship than what was asked about
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative result, explaining that Gonzaga is not west of WSU Spokane (and
        is actually east of it)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. The model never compared actual values since
        it determined one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains this is because one location appears not to
        exist. This is a case where the model rejects the premises of the question
        by indicating one location doesn't exist.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    1bb90a1b-dd07-42f9-9314-31a86ff50fc5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it determined one location doesn't
        exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a valid
        YES or NO answer" and explains this is because one location doesn't exist.
        This is a case where the model rejects the premises of the question due to
        non-existence of one location.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    1f10e748-c339-44d1-b107-24a42ad181de:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't verify one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer to this question" and explains it cannot make the comparison
        because one location cannot be verified. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    4bb6f5cf-0ad4-4f21-ba19-9d8d80e1754f:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't verify one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot make the comparison because one
        location cannot be verified. This fits the UNKNOWN criteria where the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains that the comparison is impossible because one
        location doesn't exist. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification as the
        model rejects the premises of the question by stating one institution doesn't
        exist.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    50f3511f-bca6-4107-bb22-034d45fbb521:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply couldn't verify one location to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" because it cannot verify one of the locations. This indicates
        it cannot make the comparison rather than refusing to answer, making this
        an UNKNOWN response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model's reasoning was
        about existence of locations rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot definitively say"
        and rejects the premise because one location doesn't exist. This is a case
        where the model is rejecting the premises of the question, making it an UNKNOWN
        rather than a NO comparative result.

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and that the "question cannot be answered with the information
        available" because it cannot verify one of the locations. This indicates an
        inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal or clear YES/NO answer.

        never claimed the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the
        values at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a reliable
        YES or NO answer" because it cannot verify one location. This indicates it
        cannot make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

        difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Missouri State is east of Drury (on
        National Avenue which is east of Benton Avenue). The NO is because the direction
        is opposite to what was being asked about.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that National Avenue (where MSU is)
        is east of Benton Avenue (where Drury is), indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the universities, concluding that
        Missouri State University is NOT west of Drury University because it is actually
        east of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the universities
        being in the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that one is east
        of the other (National Ave is east of Benton Ave), indicating a clear directional
        difference between their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on the relative positions of the
        universities (MSU on National Ave which is east of Benton Ave where Drury
        is located).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted both universities are in the
        same city, it explicitly stated there is a directional difference (MSU is
        east of Drury, not west). The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, after explaining that Missouri State University
        is east of Drury University, not west.

        difference, even if small. Since any stated difference, no matter how slight,
        means the values are not exactly equal, this cannot be classified as equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, followed by additional context about the minimal difference. This
        is a clear NO response to the comparison question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the locations are "very close"
        and "almost the same longitude," it explicitly states there is a slight difference
        in position, with one being "slightly more west." Since any difference, even
        if described as slight, means the values are not exactly equal, this does
        not qualify as equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, providing a clear negative response to whether National American University
        is west of University of the Southwest.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its final answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying "Ukiah is slightly east of Arcata's longitude". Any stated
        difference, even if described as "slight", means this is not an equality-based
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional result, explaining that Dharma Realm Buddhist University
        is east of Cal Poly Humboldt (not west as presumably asked in the original
        question).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it actually stated there was a difference, with Arcata being on the
        coast and Ukiah being "slightly inland", concluding that Cal Poly Humboldt
        is "further west". Since it identified a directional difference (even if slight),
        this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining that Cal
        Poly Humboldt is further west than Dharma Realm Buddhist University.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that one location is
        inland/east while the other is on the coast, indicating a clear directional
        difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that Dharma Realm Buddhist University is east
        of Cal Poly Humboldt, not west.

        in fact, it explicitly states that "Ukiah is slightly EAST of Arcata's longitude",
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Arcata
        is west of Ukiah, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer was given
        because one location is west of the other, not because they are at the same
        longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining why Dharma Realm Buddhist University cannot
        be west of Cal Poly Humboldt.

      result: 'NO'
    cdf0e8ea-d34a-47ac-90bc-94db348ba585:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one being inland/east of the other), not because the locations have equal
        coordinates. The model explicitly states that Dharma Realm is east of Cal
        Poly Humboldt.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO - Dharma
        Realm Buddhist University is not west of Cal Poly Humboldt" as its final comparative
        conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that one
        location is "slightly inland" while the other is "right on the Pacific coast"
        - indicating a difference in position, not equality. The NO was based on finding
        a directional difference, not because the locations were determined to be
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing
        the locations and determining that Dharma Realm Buddhist University is east
        (not west) of Cal Poly Humboldt.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, saying "Ukiah is slightly
        more inland" and is "EAST of Arcata." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        that Ukiah is east of Arcata, not west of it. This is a direct comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal
        - it explicitly states there is a difference, with Ukiah being 30-40 miles
        inland while Arcata is on the coast, making Arcata further west than Ukiah.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that Dharma Realm Buddhist University is east of Cal Poly Humboldt, providing
        a direct comparative answer.

    f5b040d1-1990-4b2e-9244-69ccf783ee28:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a difference in position ("slightly more east" and "slightly further
        west"), rather than stating the locations are equal. The NO is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after analyzing
        the locations and determining that Dharma Realm Buddhist University is slightly
        more east than Cal Poly Humboldt.

        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't make
        the comparison due to CSU having multiple locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (due to insufficient information
        to make the comparison)" and explains it cannot determine the answer because
        CSU has multiple campuses. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" because it cannot make the comparison without knowing which
        CSU campus is being referenced. This indicates it cannot determine the answer
        rather than refusing to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both institutions are on the
        same campus, it explicitly states they are in different locations (Bellamy
        Building vs. Louis Shores Building) with one being east of the other. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not because the locations
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        one building was explicitly stated to be EAST of the other, indicating a difference
        in position
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is east of the other, not because they are at the same location.
        It explicitly states there is a directional difference (east vs west), so
        this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't compare them because they
        don't exist as real universities.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot verify" and explains
        this is because the institutions don't exist as real universities. This is
        a case where the model rejects the premises of the question, making it an
        UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative result.

        NO), this is automatically False. The model didn't base its response on equal
        values, but rather on the non-existence of the institutions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premises of the question by
        stating these universities don't exist as real institutions. While it does
        say "NO", it's followed by an explanation that the comparison is impossible
        due to non-existence, making this a rejection of premises rather than a comparative
        result.

        the values were equal - it stated the comparison was impossible due to non-existence
        of institutions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model says "NO - The question cannot be answered
        because at least one of these institutions does not exist." This is rejecting
        the premises of the question by stating one institution doesn't exist, making
        it impossible to compare. Per the criteria, when a model rejects premises
        with "NO, but one of these doesn't exist", this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't compare them at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premises of the question by
        stating that one institution doesn't exist and the other isn't a traditional
        university. While it says "NO", it's followed by an explanation that indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to invalid premises, making this an UNKNOWN
        case per the criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premises of the question by
        stating one institution doesn't exist and the other lacks a clear location.
        While it uses "NO" in its response, it's actually saying it cannot make the
        comparison due to invalid premises, making this an UNKNOWN case per the classification
        criteria.

        didn't give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually stated the comparison
        was impossible due to non-existence of the institutions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premises by stating these universities
        don't exist as real physical campuses and explicitly states "NO ANSWER POSSIBLE."
        This falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria where the model rejects
        the premises of the question.

        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their locations
        at all since the institutions don't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        by saying it cannot make the determination because the institutions don't
        exist. This is effectively rejecting the premises of the question, making
        it an UNKNOWN rather than a clear comparative NO.

        never claimed the locations were equal - it stated the comparison was impossible
        because the institutions don't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premises by stating these institutions
        don't exist/aren't real universities, and concludes "NO valid geographical
        comparison can be made." When a model rejects the premises and indicates it
        cannot make the comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than
        NO.

        never compared actual values or stated they were equal - it instead rejected
        the premise of comparison entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO ANSWER POSSIBLE" and
        explains that it cannot make the comparison because the institutions are not
        real. This is a case where the model rejects the premises of the question,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        doesn't exist, making comparison impossible. While it says "NO", it's actually
        saying "NO, I cannot determine" because one location is fictional. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN criteria where the model rejects the premises of the question.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        didn't give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually stated it couldn't
        make the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating that Sonnencroft
        doesn't exist and explicitly says "NO VALID ANSWER POSSIBLE." This falls under
        the UNKNOWN classification criteria where the model rejects the premises of
        the question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model didn't base its response
        on equal values, but rather on the impossibility of comparison due to one
        location not existing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating one location
        doesn't exist, making comparison impossible. While it says "NO", it's actually
        stating it cannot make the comparison due to non-existence of one location,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        locations were equal - it stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise because one location
        (Sonnencroft, WV) doesn't exist, making the comparison impossible. While it
        says "NO", this is a case where the model is rejecting the ability to make
        the comparison rather than making a comparative determination, so this falls
        under the UNKNOWN criteria.

        NO), this is automatically False. The model didn't claim equal values anyway
        - it stated it couldn't verify one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating one location
        doesn't exist/can't be verified, making comparison impossible. While it uses
        "NO" in its answer, it's actually saying it cannot determine the relationship,
        not making a comparative conclusion.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated one doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise because one location
        doesn't exist, but phrases its conclusion as "NO" because it cannot make the
        comparison. Since this is rejecting the premise and indicating inability to
        determine, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating one location
        doesn't exist ("Sonnencroft appears to be a non-existent location") and explicitly
        states it cannot make the comparison ("impossible to determine its geographical
        position"). While it uses "NO", it's a NO that rejects the ability to determine

      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating that Sonnencroft
        doesn't exist, making the comparison impossible. While it uses "NO" in its
        answer, it's specifically saying "NO, we cannot determine" and explains that
        a comparison is impossible due to one location not being real. This falls

        positions, with one being east of the other. The NO is based on the opposite
        directional relationship than what was asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are equal/identical/the
        same. Instead, it explained that the NO answer is because one entity is part
        of the other (the college is part of the university), making a westward comparison
        impossible. This is a different type of reasoning than equality.

        of the other, it cannot be west of it. The reasoning is about containment
        rather than equality of location.

        that the locations are equal/identical/the same. Instead, it explained that
        one cannot be west of the other because one is part of the other, which is
        a different type of reasoning than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it reasons that since one entity is a component of the
        other, it logically cannot be west of its parent institution. The NO is based
        on this logical impossibility rather than equality of locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/identical - rather, it explains that one location is contained
        within the other (the college is "part of" and "within" the main campus).
        This containment relationship, not equality, is given as the reason for the
        NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning is not based on equal values/locations,
        but rather on the logical argument that one entity is part of the other and
        therefore cannot be west of it. It doesn't state they are at the same location/coordinates,
        just that one is part of the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations are
        equal/same/identical. Instead, it gave NO because one entity is part of the
        other, explaining that the college "cannot be west of Eastern Michigan University
        since it is part of the university itself." This is a different logical reason
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it gave a different reason for NO - that one location is part of
        the other and therefore cannot be west of it. This is a logical/structural
        reason rather than an equality comparison.
