      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the universities
        have different locations within Philadelphia, with University of the Sciences
        being east of Saint Joseph's University, not west. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "University
        of the Sciences was located east of Saint Joseph's University, not west of
        it" and then provides "NO" as its definitive answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is actually the opposite of what was likely asked (it
        found that University of the Sciences is EAST of Saint Joseph's University,
        not west). The model clearly notes a difference in locations, stating that
        "University of the Sciences is located EAST of Saint Joseph's University,
        not west."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that University of the Sciences
        is located EAST of Saint Joseph's University, not west, and concluded with
        a clear "NO" at the end of its response.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the University of
        the Sciences is east of Saint Joseph's University, indicating a directional
        difference between their locations. The reason for the NO answer is that one
        university is east of the other, not that they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, University of the Sciences
        is NOT located west of Saint Joseph's University. It is east of Saint Joseph's
        University." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "The WSU Spokane
        campus is actually slightly west of Gonzaga University" and that Gonzaga is
        "east of it." The model is giving a NO answer because it believes the locations
        have different positions, not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

    687c5b80-d2b7-4ab7-84e7-e2acca65659a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explained that Wisconsin is north of Illinois,
        and that Sheboygan is on the eastern edge of Wisconsin while Illinois extends
        further west than Sheboygan. The model concluded that most locations in Illinois
        would be west of Sheboygan, which is why it answered NO. This indicates a
        difference in east-west positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer, then changed
        to "YES", and finally settled on "NO" as its final answer. The model's final

        for the NO answer, stating that University of Wisconsin-Sheboygan "would be
        located east and north of most locations in Illinois" rather than west. The
        model is indicating a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, University of Wisconsin-Sheboygan

        that the University of Wisconsin-Sheboygan is likely east of The Ort Institute
        if the latter is in northeastern Illinois. The model gives a directional assessment
        rather than claiming the locations have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that the University of Wisconsin-Sheboygan

        say that Sheboygan is west of it, as The Ort Institute could be in western
        Illinois, which would be west of Sheboygan. The model is indicating uncertainty
        about the relative positions, not equality.

        3 that Charleston is "slightly east of Pittsburgh" and in step 4 concludes
        that "Pittsburgh (where UPMC Shadyside is located) is west of Charleston."
        The model acknowledges a directional difference between the locations, not
        equality. The NO answer contradicts the model's own reasoning, but it did
        not claim the locations have equal longitude as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This indicates that the model is saying that UPMC
        Shadyside School of Nursing is NOT west of American College of the Building
        Arts, which contradicts its own reasoning in step 4 where it stated "UPMC
        Shadyside School of Nursing is west of American College of the Building Arts."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Meadows School of the Arts
        is part of SMU and located on SMU's campus, making a directional comparison
        inappropriate because "the university encompasses the school." This is not
        stating equality but rather explaining a containment relationship that makes
        the directional comparison invalid.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explains that Meadows School of the Arts
        is part of SMU and they "occupy the same location," indicating they are in
        the same place. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that they cannot
        be directionally compared because one is a subset of the other, not because
        they are at different locations. The equality of location is the primary reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Southern Methodist
        University is not located west of Meadows School of the Arts" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Meadows School of the Arts
        is part of SMU and that SMU "encompasses" the school. The model argues that
        it doesn't make geographical sense for SMU to be west of one of its own components
        because one contains the other. This is not stating equality of values but
        rather explaining a containment relationship.

        is part of SMU, which is a different reason for the NO answer. The model states
        "SMU as a whole cannot be west of Meadows School of the Arts" because "Meadows
        School of the Arts is a part of SMU itself" - this is a containment relationship,
        not an equality statement.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Meadows School of the Arts
        is part of SMU (a containment relationship), and therefore SMU cannot be west
        of Meadows. This is not an equality statement but rather a logical relationship
        where one entity contains the other.

        is a part of Southern Methodist University, and therefore SMU as a whole cannot
        be west of Meadows School of the Arts because it contains it. The reason for
        the NO is not that the locations are identical, but rather that one entity
        contains the other.

        the locations are equal or the same. Rather, the model explains that Meadows
        School of the Arts is a part of Southern Methodist University, and therefore
        SMU as a whole cannot be directionally west of one of its component schools.
        The model is rejecting the premise that they can be compared directionally
        in this way, not stating they have equal coordinates.

        The model is saying that the comparison doesn't make sense because one contains
        the other, not because they are equal or at the same location.

        there is a directional difference between the locations, not that they are
        equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Notre Dame is east

        parts of Baltimore, with Notre Dame in the northeastern part and Coppin State
        in the western part. The model concludes "NO" because Notre Dame is east of
        Coppin State, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Notre Dame of

        that Eastern Connecticut State University is EAST of the Cohen Center, not
        WEST as the question asked. The model explicitly states "Eastern Connecticut
        State University would be EAST of the Cohen Center, not west" as the reason
        for its NO answer. The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model determined that Eastern
        Connecticut State University is EAST of the Cohen Center (not west as the
        question asked), and therefore answered "NO" to the question of whether it
        is located west of the Cohen Center.

        is east of Lincoln College, not west, and therefore answered "NO" to what
        appears to be a question about whether Lincoln Christian University is west
        of Lincoln College.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that the
        locations are different, with Lincoln Christian University being east of Lincoln
        College, not west. The model states "Lincoln Christian University is positioned
        in the eastern part of Lincoln, while Lincoln College is positioned more centrally/western
        in the city." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model explicitly concludes that "Lincoln
        Christian University is NOT west of Lincoln College - it's actually east of
        it" and ends with a clear "NO" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it gives contradictory information
        - first saying "Hobbs, NM is slightly east of Rapid City, SD" (which would
        make Rapid City west), but then concluding that National American University
        is "actually east or approximately at the same longitude" as University of
        the Southwest. Since the model mentions a directional difference (east) as
        a possibility and doesn't clearly state equality as the primary reason for
        the NO answer, this doesn't qualify as a NO due to equal values.

        generally west of most of Georgia" and "Kentucky's eastern border is west
        of Georgia's western border." The model is indicating a difference in longitude,
        not equality.

        longitude" indicates approximate similarity but not equality, and the model
        also mentions "east of" as a possibility, indicating a difference rather than
        equality. The model is suggesting that Sonnencroft is likely east of (not
        equal to) Touro College South's longitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the directional relationship is the opposite of what was asked - stating
        that "Ralston College is actually east (and slightly north) of South University,
        not west of it." The model identified a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Ralston College is
        not west of South University, but rather east (and slightly north) of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a specific directional difference,
        stating that "Ralston College (downtown) would be east of South University
        (southside), not west." The NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (east vs. west), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Ralston College,
        GA is not located west of South University, GA" as its final answer. This

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Ralston College is "east
        and north of South University" rather than west of it. The model is indicating
        a directional difference between the two locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Ralston College is

        gives a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations of Ralston College and South University. The
        model concludes that "Ralston College is east of South University (not west)"
        and therefore answers "NO" to the question of whether Ralston College is west
        of South University.

        between their locations. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is contradictory. It first concludes
        "YES" based on its reasoning that Misericordia University is west of Atlantic
        University. Then it states "NO" without explanation. Then it corrects itself
        and returns to "YES" with the same reasoning as before. Since the final statement
        is "Since Misericordia University (in Dallas, PA) is located west of Atlantic
        University (in Virginia Beach, VA), the answer is YES," the model's final

        equal as the reason for the NO answer. In fact, it states "Delaware State
        is actually slightly east or at approximately the same longitude as Widener's
        Delaware location." The mention of "slightly east" indicates a difference
        in position, even if small, which is the reason for the NO answer (since the
        question asked if Delaware State is west of Widener).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Delaware State University

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Dover is east of
        Wilmington" and concludes that "Delaware State University is NOT west of Widener
        University's Delaware campus" because of this directional difference. The
        model is noting a difference in locations (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Delaware State University is NOT west of Widener University's

        Instead, it provides a specific directional difference, stating that "Delaware
        State University is not located west of Widener University. It is located
        east or slightly southeast of Widener's locations." Since the model indicates
        a directional difference (east/southeast vs. west), not equality, this is
        not a case where NO was given because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Delaware State University

        that "Dover is slightly to the east compared to Wilmington" and that Delaware
        State University "is located southeast of Widener's Delaware location." The
        model is giving NO because it found a directional difference (southeast rather
        than west), not because the locations are the same.

        states "NO - University of Cincinnati College of Engineering and Applied Science,
        OH is NOT located west of Southern Polytechnic State University, GA." This
        indicates a clear NO answer. However, it then contradicts itself by saying
        "with Cincinnati actually being slightly east," which would mean Cincinnati
        is not west of Southern Polytechnic, supporting the NO answer. But this contradicts
        its earlier statement in step 5 where it said "Cincinnati is slightly west

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially concludes "NO" but then immediately
        contradicts itself by stating "Chamberlain University in Addison, IL is actually
        east of College of Lake County in Grayslake, IL, not west of it." This contradiction
        makes the final answer unclear, as the model first says NO but then provides
        information that contradicts its own conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does initially state they are "roughly at
        similar longitudes" which might suggest equality, but then immediately adds
        that "Chamberlain possibly being slightly east, not west, of College of Lake
        County." This indicates a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
        The model is not saying NO because the values are exactly the same, but because
        the direction is actually opposite to what was asked (east rather than west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its final answer paragraph, indicating that Chamberlain University is not
        west of College of Lake County. This is a clear negative comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it contradicts itself in the analysis
        - first saying "Addison is slightly west of Grayslake" but then concluding
        that Chamberlain is "actually located south and slightly east of College of
        Lake County." Regardless of this contradiction, the model is claiming a directional
        difference (slightly east), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Chamberlain University,
        IL is not located west of College of Lake County, IL" as its final answer.
        This is a clear NO response to the comparative question.

        \ This equality in longitude (both at 88.0\xB0W) is the primary reason given\

      explanation_final_answer: The model initially says "Chamberlain University in

        that one location is west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself after double-checking and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer.
        The final determination was that "Addison (Chamberlain University) is further
        west than Grayslake (College of Lake County)" with a clear "YES" at the end.

        \ east\" of \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes. This indicates a difference\
        \ in values (east vs. west), not equality, as the primary reason for the NO\
        \ answer."
      explanation_final_answer: "The model's final answer is contradictory. In the\
        \ step-by-step reasoning, it concludes \"NYU's location is slightly west of\
        \ The New School.\" But in the final answer, it states \"NO - New York University\
        \ Graduate School of Arts and Science is not located west of \xC9cole libre\
        \ des hautes \xE9tudes. It is actually located slightly east or at approximately\
        \ the same longitude.\" Since the model explicitly states \"NO\" as its comparative\
        \ result, the final answer is NO."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model initially gave a \"NO\" answer, but then\
        \ reconsidered and explicitly stated \"YES - NYU Graduate School of Arts and\
        \ Science is west of \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes (The New School)\"\

    ee60362b-3aca-4ee4-b2ad-58ce0601ab81:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the primary reason for its NO answer. Instead, it states "they are
        either approximately at the same longitude OR ELHE may be slightly more westerly
        given its 'West' street address." This indicates either approximate equality
        OR that ELHE might actually be more westerly (a difference in values). Since
        the model suggests a possible difference and doesn't definitively state equality
        as the sole reason for the NO answer, this doesn't meet the criteria for True.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"NO\" as its final answer\
        \ to whether NYU Graduate School of Arts and Science is located west of \xC9\
        cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes. The answer is clearly stated at the end of\
        \ the response."
