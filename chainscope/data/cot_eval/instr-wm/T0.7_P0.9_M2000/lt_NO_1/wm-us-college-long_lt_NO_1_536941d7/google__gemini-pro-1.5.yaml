      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Saint Joseph's University is "generally
        considered further west," suggesting a difference in location. The NO answer
        appears to be because the premise (that University of Sciences is west of
        Saint Joseph's) is incorrect, not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, NO"
        as its comparative answer, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2da714c9-25d7-4f5e-b754-59086bf7012f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that one location is east of the other. The
        NO answer is given because University of the Sciences is east (not west) of
        Saint Joseph's University.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining that University of the Sciences is east of Saint
        Joseph's University.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any equality comparisons
        in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    4e8e34f0-9d9f-4be8-bfac-da9fb997ca74:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The actual content about locations being
        similar or different is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason
        for NO answers.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly stated "USciences's campus was west of Saint Joseph's
        main campus," indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was given
        because USciences was not west of Saint Joseph's
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations of both universities
      final_answer: 'NO'

    a68a4e62-6a00-4eb9-a155-464fb4b06b06:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model stated that University of the Sciences is
        "slightly west" of Saint Joseph's University, indicating a difference in position
        (even if small). The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing
        the relative positions and finding that University of the Sciences is "slightly
        west" of Saint Joseph's University.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any equal
        values were mentioned.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly indicated
        a directional difference (University of the Sciences being east of Saint Joseph's
        University), making this a NO based on difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after providing directional analysis showing University of the
        Sciences is east of Saint Joseph's University.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f426c781-5fad-46a1-bf00-3d3deada5a35:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly noted a difference in positions, stating that SJU is
        "further west" than the area where USciences is located. This difference in
        position, not equality, is what led to the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f45f978d-b93b-4f23-892d-575d0d990a4b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it determined that University City is "generally west
        of" the main Saint Joseph's campus, indicating a directional difference, even
        if slight. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations of both universities.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equality/inequality of values is not
        relevant when the final answer isn't NO
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after its step-by-step analysis

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation only
        applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after its step-by-step analysis.

    28f4bb28-1db0-4286-a26e-0f907708b38e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values question only applies when
        analyzing NO answers
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis determining that Gonzaga is slightly west of WSU Spokane
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      result: 'YES'
    7c7c3fce-a414-4cb0-aae1-bdac917c4a86:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer was that "both
        universities are in the same city" and "one cannot be west of the other,"
        implying they are in the same location/have equal positions. This equality
        was the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, after reasoning that both universities are in the same
        city.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    c3d6ba6f-8b4f-4c6f-b065-608af3c119f0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both universities are in the
        same city, it doesn't explicitly state they are at the exact same location
        or have equal coordinates. Instead, it suggests they might be "adjacent, across
        the street, or in different parts of the city" and concludes NO because being
        in the same city means one can't be meaningfully "west" of the other. The
        NO is based on rejecting the premise of westward positioning rather than stating
        equal locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. The model provided reasoning
        and arrived at a definitive negative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cfce9434-c267-42e2-a51b-5607033739f6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not applicable
        since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    d172b276-d5fc-4965-a6a7-a20a0a5794fd:

      result: 'YES'
    dc0958d1-afb3-471d-aecf-584cbf291170:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are exactly
        equal or identical. Instead, it argues that they cannot be meaningfully described
        as one being west of the other because they are in the same city, but acknowledges
        they could be "adjacent, across the street, or in different parts of the city."
        This is a different reasoning than saying they are at the exact same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative locations of the universities.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    de722c88-9235-40e9-b2f9-7c91224b5043:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" in bold
        at the end of its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    1e5130be-48d9-4adc-8a2b-123aeca2d3a1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "While the longitudes are close (-87.73\xB0 vs -87.75\xB0\
        ), the model explicitly states there is a difference (\"slightly east\") and\
        \ uses this difference as the reason for the NO answer, rather than stating\
        \ they are equal/same/identical."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the longitudes and determining that Sheboygan is slightly
        east, not west, of the comparison point.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    21539dce-4b7d-4efd-971c-b194cf8b0241:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific longitude values (-87.8
        and -87.7), it does not state that these values are equal. In fact, it explicitly
        notes they are different values and states that "Sheboygan is west of Skokie."
        The NO answer is not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        after explaining that Sheboygan is west of Skokie (which appears to contradict
        its NO answer, but we're instructed to focus only on the explicit final answer)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3e85d770-93dc-4c19-b360-17af2189942e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis determining that UW-Sheboygan is west of The Ort Institute.

    5b1d7330-6478-498f-82e3-f302f8ae1f14:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        the same longitude or equally west. Instead, it explained that the difference
        is directional - one location is north of the other, not west. The NO answer
        was based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that one location is not west of the other.
        The answer was clear and definitive.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a7fc4452-0e7c-49eb-b4c5-c52f6a1c7a38:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (northwest vs strictly
        west). The NO is because the direction is northwest rather than strictly west,
        not because the locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing clear reasoning about why one location is northwest rather
        than strictly west of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a870695c-2f62-44d0-9a5d-f82669c4710e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly describes a difference in position, stating
        that Sheboygan would be east of Chicago/Skokie. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after working through the relative positions of the
        locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cf83e8ad-93de-43b0-96ce-994a189ce7b3:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes a directional difference, stating
        that Skokie is "south and east" of Sheboygan. The NO answer appears to be
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was because the College
        of Agriculture was found to be east of the College of Health and Human Sciences,
        indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        impossible. This is a different type of reasoning than equality.

        because one is part of the other, which is a different reason than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        locations are exactly the same (Meadows being part of SMU) and explicitly
        states "they are in the same location." The NO conclusion was primarily because
        something "cannot be west of itself" due to this exact equality of location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        "something can't be west of itself." This is a different logical reason than
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates that Notre Dame of Maryland University
        is "slightly northwest" of Coppin State University, indicating a difference
        in position rather than equality. This directional difference, even though
        described as "slight," means the locations are not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        State, indicating a directional difference between their positions. The NO
        answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        indicating a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this directional difference rather than equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that the longitudes were
        different (-76.633 vs -76.660) and used this difference to conclude that Notre
        Dame is east of Coppin State, not west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both universities are "in Baltimore"
        and "in the same location," it also mentions that "one might be slightly west"
        with more precise locations. Since it acknowledges potential differences rather
        than stating they are exactly at the same longitude, this does not qualify
        as equal values being the primary reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its geographical analysis
        concluding that Muskingum University is not west of Hodges University.

      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates that the universities are "in
        the same city" and states that "one cannot be significantly west of the other."
        While this implies similarity in location, it doesn't explicitly state they
        are at exactly the same location/coordinates, and the reasoning suggests more
        about proximity than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 3, and this appears to be a direct comparative answer rather than
        a rejection of premises or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Phoenix is east of Glendale and therefore
        Grand Canyon University is east of New College of Interdisciplinary Arts and
        Sciences. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both universities are in the
        same city, it does not explicitly state they are at the exact same location
        or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. Instead, the NO appears
        to be based on insufficient information to determine relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a rejection
        of premises or inability to verify. While the model expresses uncertainty
        about relative positions, it provides a clear "NO" as its final conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on both universities
        being in the same city ("both universities are in the same city"), and it
        explicitly states this sameness of location as the reason why neither can
        be west of the other. This is a case where equality of location is the primary
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on them being in the
        same city, stating "Being in the same city, one can't be strictly west of
        the other." However, this doesn't explicitly state they are at the exact same
        location or have equal coordinates - just that they're in the same city. Being
        in the same city doesn't necessarily mean equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both universities are in the
        same city and concludes that "neither is west of the other" as the reason
        for its NO answer. This indicates the locations are treated as equivalent/same,
        and this equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not explicitly state that the locations
        are exactly equal in longitude or position. Instead, it states they are "in
        the same city" and therefore "one cannot be strictly west of the other." Being
        in the same city does not necessarily mean equal coordinates, so this is not
        a claim of exact equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they are in the same city,
        it doesn't explicitly state they are at the exact same location or have equal
        coordinates. Instead, it argues that being in the same city means one cannot
        be meaningfully west of the other, which is a different reasoning than exact
        equality.

        NO answer is based on the locations being the same/equal, with their equality
        being the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, and this NO is given as a direct answer rather

      explanation_equal_values: While the model states both universities are in the
        same city, it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly the same location
        or have equal coordinates. The reason given for NO is that they can't be meaningfully
        west of each other because they're in the same city, not because they're at
        identical locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning indicates that both universities
        are in the same city and therefore neither is west of the other - effectively
        stating they are at the same location (in terms of east/west positioning).
        The NO answer is directly based on this equality of position.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both universities are in the
        same city, it does not explicitly state they are at the exact same location
        or have equal coordinates. Instead, it suggests they might be adjacent, across
        the street, or have overlapping areas. The NO answer is based on the reasoning
        that one cannot be "purely west" of the other, not because they are at exactly
        the same location.

        in Connecticut. This is a difference-based explanation, not an equality-based
        one.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Vermont Studio Center is north, not west, of Hartford International
        University). The NO is based on a different relative position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, making a direct comparative judgment that Vermont Studio Center

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Vermont is directly north of Connecticut, making it impossible for a Vermont
        location to be west of a Connecticut location. The NO is based on relative
        positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the locations
        are equal/same - in fact, it acknowledged there might be a slight west difference
        but argued that the north-south relationship makes the westward comparison
        invalid. This is a different reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after explaining
        that Vermont Studio Center is not west of Hartford International University
        because the north-south relationship overrides the east-west relationship.

        that Johnson, VT is "north of Hartford, CT, and very slightly east." Even
        though the difference might be small ("very slightly"), any stated directional
        difference means this is not a case of equal values.

        NC is east of Salem, OH (not because the locations are equal). The model explicitly
        states a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after working through the locations and their relative
        positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it went through a geographical analysis and concluded
        NO, implying a different relative position (though its reasoning seems to
        contradict its conclusion). Since equality was not mentioned as the reason
        for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, without any caveats or
        uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Charlotte is east of Salem (not because the locations are at the same longitude).
        Since it indicates a directional difference (not equality), this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after reasoning about the relative positions of the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because it determines Charlotte,
        NC is east of Salem, OH (not west), not because the locations are at equal
        longitudes. It explicitly states a directional difference ("North Carolina
        is generally east of Ohio").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates a difference in position, stating
        that Charlotte is "still further east than Salem." The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing geographical reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    9bb923d2-bd89-4f01-8b03-cd759dfc92bd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it determines their relative positions and concludes
        NO after finding that Charlotte, NC is east of Salem, OH. The NO appears to
        be based on finding a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after walking through its reasoning steps about the

    ddc05989-6156-49b5-a919-ed0c5eaf1294:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it actually determines that Charlotte, NC is east of
        Salem, OH, which indicates a difference in location. The NO answer appears
        to be inconsistent with its own reasoning, but we must evaluate based on what
        was explicitly stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its step-by-step reasoning about the locations of the universities.

    ee8ad870-ceb1-42d3-9190-5a993f8ba5a6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because it determines Queens University
        is east of Kent State Salem (not because they're equal). It explicitly states
        "North Carolina is generally east of Ohio" and concludes this means Queens
        University cannot be west of Kent State Salem.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

    1410edc8-88cf-4ec5-8bd2-76cc2ff7d92c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because Franklin
        Springs is east of Athens, not because the locations are the same. In fact,
        it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Franklin Springs is
        east of Athens). Therefore, the NO is based on a difference in position, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this is a direct response to the question about relative position
        (west of). The answer is clear and definitive.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    335eb3b4-c731-4cfd-b4b1-1e9f25c11abe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that "Franklin Springs is east of Athens,"
        indicating a difference in location. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5382ec9c-e4d8-4494-9901-549e11e67b95:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Franklin Springs is east
        of Athens" and uses this directional difference (not equality) as the basis
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step
        3 and once as the final answer. This is a direct comparative answer to the
        question of whether Franklin College is west of UGA.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    53de9079-b38a-4e16-a6ce-b442f2345680:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Franklin Springs is east
        of Athens" and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
        Even though this is the opposite direction from what was asked, we take the
        model's statements at face value.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step
        3 and once as a final standalone answer. This is an explicit NO answer to
        the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly stated that Franklin Springs is east
        of Athens, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer appears to be
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Franklin Springs is explicitly stated to be east of Athens, indicating a difference
        in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, and provides directional reasoning (Franklin Springs
        being east of Athens) to support this answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model's reasoning was not based on equal values
        but rather on the non-existence of the locations being compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it rejects the premise of the comparison since it states neither university
        has a physical location in Arizona. When a model rejects the premises of the
        question, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

    271df557-dabe-469d-9570-af6018670f24:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that both
        colleges are in the same city (Lubbock, TX) and therefore "one cannot be west
        of the other." This is effectively stating they are at the same location geographically,
        and this equality is the primary reason for the NO answer. While the model
        mentions they might be on different sides of campus, this is explicitly excluded
        from the broader geographical comparison being made.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result (not a rejection of premises
        or inability to determine).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "they are both on the same campus"
        and uses this equality of location as the primary reason for concluding NO,
        indicating they are in the same place rather than one being west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after reasoning about the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in step 3 as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative conclusion that Texas Tech is west
        of Whitacre College.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "YES" as its
        final answer after walking through its reasoning steps.

    3abe465a-5e88-43ad-8cf1-ca0a66344571:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on the fact that both
        colleges are in the exact same city (Lubbock, TX), and this equality of location
        was the primary reason given for why one cannot be west of the other "in a
        meaningful geographic sense." While it acknowledges they might differ on campus,
        it explicitly bases its NO on their being in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after determining that since both colleges are in the same city, one
        cannot be west of the other in a meaningful geographic sense.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    4ef770a6-6c65-4438-94c4-82544b497e6a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates both colleges are at the
        same location (same campus), it doesn't explicitly state this equality as
        the reason for the NO answer. Instead, it states they "cannot be meaningfully
        east or west of each other" because they are part of the same university system
        and campus. This is more about the impossibility of comparison rather than
        explicit equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after explaining
        that the colleges cannot be meaningfully compared in terms of east/west position
        since they are part of the same university campus.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    86ddc834-e83c-4627-8db4-60c255cd63bc:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the colleges are "on the same
        campus" and uses this equality of location as the primary reason why one cannot
        be west of the other "in a meaningful geographic sense." This is explicitly
        stating they are in the same location and using this sameness as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after explaining that the colleges cannot be west of each other since
        they are on the same campus.

        False according to the criteria. The equal values comparison is not relevant
        since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after analyzing
        the locations and determining that Lubbock is further west than College Station

    b9ad8b57-74fb-474f-87a9-2abbb65c124c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give equality as the reason for
        its NO answer. Instead, it explains that the buildings of both colleges are
        distributed across campus in a way that makes a clear directional relationship
        impossible to establish. The NO is based on the complexity of building locations,
        not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis. While the model expresses uncertainty in its reasoning,
        it does provide a clear NO as its comparative conclusion, not a refusal to
        answer or indication it cannot determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c2dc1acb-aee3-49d2-829d-2096e45025bb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - rather, it says it cannot determine their relative positions
        without a campus map. The NO answer is given because the westward relationship
        cannot be verified, not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it as a direct comparative result (even though it expresses uncertainty
        about the actual positions)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Maine is north and east of Massachusetts). The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer, but not because the
        locations were equal/same. Instead, it stated that UNE is "north, not west"
        of Ipswich, indicating a different directional relationship rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that UNE is not west of Ipswich Female Seminary.
        The answer was clear and definitive.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Pasadena is not
        directly west of Long Beach" as its reasoning, indicating a directional difference
        rather than equality as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion, making this a definitive NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Art Center being
        east of Cal State LA, not because the locations are equal/same. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference (Pasadena is east of Los
        Angeles).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Art Center is east of Cal State LA, not west. This is
        a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that "Pasadena is inland and slightly north of Long Beach" and "Pasadena
        is east of Long Beach." The NO answer is based on these positional differences,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        values being compared were equal. Instead, the reason given was that Art Center
        College of Design cannot be west of California State University because it's
        located within California. This is a logical impossibility reason, not an
        equality reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a logical explanation based on geographical impossibility
        (cannot be west of California when it's in California)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the schools are very near
        each other on the same campus, it doesn't explicitly state they are in exactly
        the same location. Rather, it indicates that the concept of "west" at this
        scale requires more precise information. The NO answer appears to be based
        on the unlikelihood of significant directional differences rather than exact
        equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer, and this appears to be a comparative result rather than a rejection
        of premises or inability to determine.

        ("on the same campus, or very close"), it never explicitly states they are
        at exactly the same location or have equal coordinates. The NO answer appears
        to be based on rejecting a significant westward difference, not on stating
        the locations are exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that since one school is
        north and the other is more central/slightly east, the first school cannot
        be west of the second. The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because the School
        of Public Health was explicitly stated to be "north and slightly east" of
        the College of Pharmacy, indicating a difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with the School of Public Health being "north and slightly east"
        of the College of Pharmacy. The NO answer was given because the direction
        was opposite to what was being asked about.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Marylhurst is "south of Portland"
        rather than west, which is a different directional relationship. The NO answer
        is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the relative locations of the two

    c7b32365-b18e-4dc4-94e4-7eaffc4b3f4a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        coordinates or positions. Instead, it determined NO based on finding that
        one location is east of the other (indicating different positions), specifically
        stating "Portland is generally west of Lake Oswego" and "Marylhurst is east
        of Oregon College of Oriental Medicine".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after reasoning about the relative positions of the two
        locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating Marylhurst is south of OCOM), not on the locations being equal/same.
        It explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Marylhurst
        is south of OCOM, not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis, stating that Bellamy Hall (Social Sciences) is west
        of Strozier Library.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the colleges are close to
        each other ("on the same campus"), it never explicitly states they are at
        exactly the same location or have equal coordinates. The NO answer appears
        to be based on the improbability of significant separation rather than exact
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    5160a9bc-51e5-420f-96fa-a58ae0244e83:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the locations are likely
        "close together" and on the same campus, it doesn't explicitly state they
        are exactly equal or identical in location. The reasoning suggests they are
        merely close, which still allows for some difference in position. The NO isn't
        based on exact equality but rather on the unlikelihood of significant difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide this
        definitive comparative answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5aae3c64-27f2-47c2-a93b-e8e1230130bc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that Bellamy is "slightly northeast of Strozier",
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the buildings

    99e89222-3f5c-46ba-a762-24625c8ab68b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that one location is "slightly
        southeast" of the other, indicating a difference in position, not equality.
        While the difference is described as "slight," any stated difference means
        this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4, and this is clearly presented as a comparative result based on
        the relative positions described in step 3.

    a462e112-87bb-4cc8-970e-5386b74c1a88:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        one building was explicitly stated to be east of the other, indicating a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that the College of Social Sciences is east
        (not west) of the School of Library & Information Studies.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "the Bellamy Building is slightly
        east of Strozier Library" - indicating a difference in position, not equality.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on the locations
        being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" after determining that one location is slightly east of the
        other

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any discussion of relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't definitively
        answer YES or NO without access to that visual information" and does not provide
        a clear comparative answer, instead indicating it needs more information to
        make the determination.

    01d15ee1-5fbd-4fd0-8124-732ab39e5fd2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the locations are "in the
        same general area" and "likely very close together", it doesn't explicitly
        state they are exactly/approximately equal in position. In fact, it notes
        that "more precise location information would be needed to be absolutely sure",
        indicating some uncertainty about their exact relative positions. Since equality
        is not explicitly stated as the reason for the NO answer, this should be classified
        as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this appears to be a direct comparative answer rather than a rejection
        of ability to determine or premises, so this should be classified as NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it concluded NO because it determined that one location would likely
        be east of the other ("most other South Bay cities/universities are slightly
        to the east"), indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a comparative
        answer after its step-by-step reasoning, indicating that the first location
        is not west of the second location.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    3abc13f2-f8ff-4c17-81ae-aa4e496ca2dd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is east of the other, not because they are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states "Hayward is generally east of Cupertino" and concludes
        CSUEB is "not west" of Apple Park. This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that CSUEB is east (not west) of Apple Park. This is a direct
        comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison based on equal values since it refused to make any definitive
        comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer" and explains that the question lacks sufficient information and is
        based on a fictional premise. This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.
      final_answer: REFUSED

    832debda-57ea-4716-8dd8-614d94a572e5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Sunnyvale is "slightly
        northwest of Cupertino") and concludes NO because northwest is not directly
        west. The difference in direction, not equality, is the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its analysis that northwest is not
        directly west.

        northwest of Cupertino," indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        Even though this might be a small difference, any stated difference means
        the NO answer was not due to equal values.

        that Oakland is "south and slightly east of Vallejo". Even though this might
        be a small difference, any stated directional difference means we must classify
        this as False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Oakland is "generally
        East of Vallejo," indicating a difference in position. The NO appears to be
        given because Oakland (where Patten University is) is east of Vallejo (where
        California Maritime Academy is), not because they're in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        making a clear directional distinction. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying Virginia is east of Spain. Even though this geography is
        incorrect, the model clearly indicates a directional difference rather than
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer regarding whether Army Logistics University is west of Cordoba,

        Arlington, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on
        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        never made a comparison of equal values since it determined one location doesn't
        exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating "It's impossible
        to answer YES/NO because the premise of the question... is false" and indicates
        that one of the locations (Cordoba University) doesn't exist. This falls under
        the UNKNOWN criteria where the model rejects the premises of the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same in terms of longitude. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        WV was "generally north and east of Florida" - indicating a difference in
        position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether one location is west of the other, providing

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both colleges are in the
        same city, it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly the same location
        or longitude. Instead, it states that one "cannot be significantly west of
        the other," which implies there could still be some difference in position,
        just not a significant one.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both colleges are in the same
        city, it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly/approximately equal
        positions. Instead, it uses this information to conclude that neither can
        be west of the other, which is a different logical argument than saying they're
        at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        city, one cannot be west of the other" and uses this as the basis for its
        NO answer. This indicates the model is treating their locations as effectively
        the same/equal, and this equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 3, and this is given as a direct comparative result based on the analysis

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are exactly
        equal or identical. Instead, it suggests they are in the same city but acknowledges
        they might be "a few blocks apart in any direction" and that "one is slightly
        west." Since it admits potential differences, even if small, this doesn't
        qualify as equal values being the reason for NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both institutions are in Savannah
        and on the same street, it does not state they are at the same location. In
        fact, it explicitly states they are at different addresses (5102 vs 7090 Abercorn
        Street) and concludes that one is north of the other. The NO answer is based
        on directional difference (north vs west), not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis

        in longitude values (-75.96 vs -75.98) and indicated Misericordia is "slightly
        east" of the comparison point. Even though the difference is small, any stated
        difference means this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the longitudes and determining that Misericordia is slightly east (not west)
        of the comparison point.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - rather, it explains that one location is north of the other
        (not west). It identifies a specific directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not
        applicable since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after laying out its reasoning steps.

    3ce37c26-56d9-4b72-8e55-9cec6cf4d368:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests both institutions are in
        the same city, it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly the same location
        or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. Instead, it suggests there
        might be slight differences based on specific addresses, even if not significant.
        Any acknowledgment of potential difference, even if described as minimal,
        means this isn't a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the original
        comparison question rather than a refusal or inability to determine.

    40281feb-9c56-4551-b1b2-d7dac62f6d6b:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on both institutions
        being in the same city (Santa Ana), with the explicit reasoning that "neither
        is west of the other" because they are in the same location. This indicates
        equality of location as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that neither location is west of the other since they are in the same city.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the locations are "very close,"
        it explicitly states there are some differences in position, with "some RSCCD
        buildings *might* be slightly west." The NO answer is based on the fact that
        "not all of RSCCD is west of CCU" rather than because the locations are exactly
        equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its comparative
        answer, providing specific reasoning about why RSCCD is not entirely west
        of CCU. While it notes uncertainty and complexity, it gives a clear NO answer
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both institutions are in the
        same city (Santa Ana), it doesn't explicitly state they are at the same location
        or have equal positions. Instead, it suggests that more precise addresses
        would be needed and that it's "highly improbable" one is significantly west
        of the other. This indicates uncertainty rather than equality as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, making a clear comparative judgment, even though it expressed some
        uncertainty about precise locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both colleges are located in
        the same city" and concludes that "neither is west of the other" as the reason
        for its NO answer. This indicates that their locations are considered to be
        the same, and this equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining that neither college is west of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates the locations are "very
        close," it doesn't explicitly state they are exactly/approximately equal or
        identical. The response suggests their proximity makes it difficult to determine
        a west/east relationship, but doesn't claim they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result (not a rejection of ability
        to determine or premises)

    af235be1-cb9a-4da7-beeb-c1ada74d0c71:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they are both in Santa Ana,
        it doesn't explicitly state they are at the exact same location. Instead,
        it notes they "might be adjacent, overlapping, or one might encompass the
        other." The NO answer is based on the impossibility of a west/east relationship,
        not because of proven equality of location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that one institution is not west of the other.

    dc0b36d2-c974-4376-ac05-baa1ae0cd9ad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it explains that their relative positions could vary
        (west, east, north, or south) depending on which specific RSCCD campus is
        considered. The NO answer is based on this uncertainty about relative positions,
        not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its analysis of the relative
        positions, not a rejection of premises or inability to verify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are exactly
        equal or identical. Instead, it explains that while they are in the same city
        (Santa Ana), they could be in different relative positions within the city.
        The NO answer is based on the reasoning that being in the same city means
        one cannot be "west" of the other in a broader geographic sense, not because
        they are at the exact same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparison question, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result
        (not as inability to determine or rejection of premises).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are "in the same area"
        and "in the same city," it does not explicitly state they are at exactly the
        same location. In fact, it mentions that "specific campus locations within
        Santa Ana might make one slightly west of the other." This acknowledgment
        of potential slight differences, even if minor, means it's not claiming exact
        equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to the comparative question. While it discussed nuances, it provided
        a clear final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates there are directional differences between
        the locations (one being on the west side and one being on the north side),
        though it argues that Illinois College of Optometry is "not significantly
        west" of Loyola. The presence of any directional difference means this is
        not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the locations of the two institutions.

        Instead, it explicitly states that ICO is "slightly west" of Loyola's Medical
        Center campus, indicating a difference in position (even though small). The
        NO answer is based on this slight difference not being significant enough,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing specific reasoning about the relative positions
        of the institutions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly noted a difference in locations, stating that Illinois
        College of Optometry is in the West Loop while Loyola's campuses are "further
        north and east, near Lake Michigan." The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations of both institutions within
        Chicago.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states differences, concluding that "Illinois
        College of Optometry is both North and West of Loyola's Main campus." The
        NO answer is based on these directional differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its step-by-step analysis. The answer is definitive and comparative,
        not indicating uncertainty or refusal.

        Illinois College of Optometry being "on the near west side" while Loyola's
        main campus is "further east, right on the lake." Since it notes a directional
        difference, even though both are in Chicago, this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes they are in different locations
        (west side vs. north side) and specifically states "West is a different direction
        than North" as its reasoning for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, noting that Illinois College of Optometry is west of Loyola's
        Lake Shore Campus. The NO answer is based on this directional difference.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on both institutions
        being in the same city (Newton, MA) and explicitly states "they are both located
        in the same city" as the reason for the NO answer. This indicates equality
        of location was the primary reason for the negative response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining

        being exactly equal or identical. Instead, it explained that while both are
        in Newton, one cannot be simply "west" of the other because their relative
        positions might involve other directions (northwest/southwest) or they might
        be adjacent. This indicates a different reason for the NO answer rather than

        same longitude," it explicitly states there is a slight south-west positioning
        of EMU relative to D'Youville. Since it acknowledges a directional difference
        (even if slight), this does not qualify as stating they are exactly equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        that while EMU is slightly south-west of D'Youville, it's not significantly
        enough west to be considered simply "west" of it.

        cite equality as a reason - it instead stated the comparison was impossible
        due to one institution being online.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question since
        one institution is online and therefore cannot be compared directionally.
        While it says "NO", it immediately clarifies that the question is "unanswerable",
        indicating it cannot make the comparison. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria

        never made a comparison of equal values since it determined one entity lacked
        a physical location to compare.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that "the question cannot
        be answered meaningfully" and that "It's not a matter of simply YES or NO,
        the question itself is flawed." The model rejects the premise of the question
        because one location lacks a physical presence, making the comparison impossible.

        that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explained that since
        one institution is online, the geographic comparison doesn't apply in a meaningful
        way. This is a different reason than equality for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a rejection
        of ability to determine or verify. While the model notes that the comparison
        may not be meaningful, it still provides a clear NO answer.

        west or east of each other," it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly
        the same longitude or that they are equal/identical. The response suggests
        they are close but doesn't claim exact equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, and this NO is given as a direct comparative
        result (not as inability to determine or rejection of premises).

        Moines University is in a western suburb compared to Drake University's location.
        It indicates a directional difference (not equality) between the locations
        as the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        or identical coordinates. Instead, it indicated that Drake is in Des Moines
        proper while Des Moines University is in the eastern suburbs, implying different
        locations. The NO answer appears to be based on relative positions, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates the locations are "essentially
        in the same city," it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly/approximately
        equal longitudes. Rather, it suggests that being in the same city makes the
        west/east comparison not "geographically meaningful." This is a different
        reason than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after explaining that the locations cannot be meaningfully compared
        as west/east of each other since they are in the same city.

        or same longitude. Instead, it based its NO answer on reasoning that Hampton's
        coastal location makes it unlikely to be west of inland Millersville, indicating
        a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without qualifying it as inability to determine or rejecting
        premises. While it mentions some uncertainty, it makes a clear determination
        based on geographical reasoning.
