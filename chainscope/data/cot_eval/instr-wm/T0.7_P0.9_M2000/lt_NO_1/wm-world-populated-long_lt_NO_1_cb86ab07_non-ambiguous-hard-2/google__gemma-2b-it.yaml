        of Rowan County, North Carolina" without indicating that this is because they
        are at the same longitude or have equal positions. The model gives a directional
        assessment rather than claiming equality.

        any explanation for this answer. The model did not state that the values (locations)
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply listed steps to check locations
        and then gave the NO answer without explaining the reasoning. Since equality
        was not mentioned as the reason for the NO, this criterion is not met.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values are equal. Instead, it states that Gibson, Tennessee is located east
        of Graeagle, California, indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The model is asserting that there is a geographic difference (one
        is east of the other), not that they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Gibson,
        Tennessee is located east of Graeagle, California." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question, indicating that one location is east of the other.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives different locations for Moroni (western
        Indian Ocean) and Nalagarh (eastern Indian Ocean), indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference, not on
        equality of values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Nalagarh is east
        of Moroni, Comoros (indicating a difference in location), which is why it
        answers NO. The model is asserting a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        in Italy, not in Quebec - indicating a difference in locations rather than
        equality. The model is pointing out a geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the

        is based on this geographical difference, not on any equality between the
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly begins its response with "No",

        doesn't apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        using the information given" which indicates it is refusing to provide a comparative
        answer due to lack of information. It explicitly states it cannot answer the
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lisburn is
        located east of Sarasota Springs, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The model is asserting that the locations are different (one
        is east of the other), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
        It then provides a geographical explanation that Lisburn is located east of
        Sarasota Springs, Florida, and is in Maine.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Lisburn, Northern Ireland
        is located west of Sarasota Springs, Florida" which indicates a directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"

        equal or the same. Instead, it's based on the locations being in different
        places (Northern Ireland vs. Florida). The model is pointing out a difference
        in locations, not stating they are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Lisburn is in Northern Ireland while Sarasota Springs is in
        Florida.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Broseley is in England and San Miguel is in Chile, and therefore Broseley
        cannot be west of San Miguel. This is a geographical reasoning rather than
        an equality claim.

        - that Phalut is in the Eastern Hemisphere while Verd is in the Western Hemisphere,
        which means Phalut cannot be west of Verd. The model is indicating a difference
        in hemispheric location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Phalut is not located west of
        Verd" which is a clear negative comparative statement, but it does not explicitly
        state "NO" as the final answer. However, the statement "Phalut is not located

        not explicitly mentioned as being in the Pacific Ocean while Verd is. This
        is not an equality-based reasoning.

        the center of France, and therefore Shipley is not west of Mascouche. The
        model is making a directional comparison and finding them different, not equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it claims that Bernardsville is in the US while Lockeford is in California
        (which is actually a factual error since California is in the US, but we're
        only evaluating what the model stated). The model's reasoning is based on
        a perceived geographical impossibility rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference - that Masvingo
        Province is located east of Stoke, Plymouth. This indicates the locations
        have different positions, not that they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides a directional explanation that Masvingo Province is located east
        of Stoke, Plymouth.

        being compared (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. It simply
        states that Masvingo Province is not located west of Stoke, Plymouth, without
        explaining that this is because they are at the same longitude or in the same
        location. There is no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Masvingo Province is not located west of
        Stoke, Plymouth. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the two locations
        are in different countries (Zimbabwe vs. England) and different regions (southern
        Zimbabwe vs. southwest England). The model is highlighting their differences,
        not their equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states they are "not located
        in the same geographical location" as the reason for its NO answer. This indicates
        a difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        to the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values;
        it refused to make the comparison entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model doesn't provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that the question "cannot be answered"
        because the two locations are in different countries (Zimbabwe and England).
        This is effectively refusing to make the comparison by indicating it's not

        between the locations. This difference in location is the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not claim
        the values were equal - it actually claimed Amethi district is west of Skuodas.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes, Amethi district

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both Amethi district and Skuodas
        are located in the "central region of Ethiopia" and concludes that "Amethi
        district is not west of Skuodas." The model is implying they are in the same
        central region, suggesting they have the same or similar location, which is
        why one is not west of the other. This equality of location (both being in
        the central region) is the primary reason given for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply concludes that Amethi district
        is not located west of Skuodas, without indicating that they are in the same
        location or have equal coordinates. The model does not give equality as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        region of Ethiopia" and concludes that "Amethi district is not west of Skuodas."
        The model is implying that they are in the same region, but it doesn't explicitly
        state that they are at the exact same longitude or that they are exactly equal
        in position. It simply states they are both in the central region, which doesn't
        necessarily mean identical positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Bargal is in the east hemisphere while Lika is in the west hemisphere,
        making it impossible for Bargal to be west of Lika. The model is noting a
        difference in hemispheric location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that it cannot answer the question because
        it lacks information about the relative positions of Bargal and Lika. This
        is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While it makes claims about the hemispheres of
        both locations (saying Thisayanvilai is NOT in Western Hemisphere and Nadvirna
        IS in Western Hemisphere), it then draws a conclusion that "Thisayanvilai
        is located west of Nadvirna" without explicitly stating YES or NO. The conclusion
        actually contradicts the premises, as something not in the Western Hemisphere
        would typically be east of something in the Western Hemisphere, but the model
        doesn't provide a clear YES/NO answer to the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Huntington is in the eastern United States while Silao is
        in the eastern Pacific Ocean, and concludes that "Huntington is not west of
        Silao." The NO is based on geographical positioning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" without giving a clear YES or NO answer. This indicates
        the model is refusing to make the comparison due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Huntington, New York is not located west of Silao" because "The
        eastern United States are to the west of the Philippines." The model is making
        a geographical comparison and finding a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reasoning, stating
        that "Huntington is not west of Silao" as the reason for its NO answer. The
        model is making a geographical comparison and concluding one location is not
        west of the other, not that they have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, this question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at
        all, so we cannot evaluate whether it gave a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "we cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" without giving a YES or NO answer. It indicates it lacks
        sufficient information to make the comparison between the locations of Huntington,
        New York and Silao. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer. While it states "Huntington, New York is not located west
        of Silao," it doesn't format this as a clear "NO" answer to the question.
        The response also contains factual errors (Huntington, NY is not in the western
        US, and Silao is typically a city in Mexico, not the Philippines), suggesting
        the model may be confused, but we're evaluating the format of the answer,
        not its factual accuracy.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific reason for its NO answer
        - it claims that City of Hume is in Macedonia (West Europe) while Uruzgan
        Province is in Uzbekistan (West Asia). The model is making a directional claim
        that Hume is not west of Uruzgan, not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly says "So, the answer is **NO**.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on different locations (Scotland vs. Turkmenistan), indicating a difference
        rather than equality.

        - that the City of Hume "cannot be located west of Uruzgan Province" because
        they are "in different continents." The model is not claiming equality as
        the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Kondagaon district is located in the Philippines, which is located
        east of Pechorsky District in Russia" and therefore "cannot be west of Pechorsky
        District." The model is claiming a directional difference (east vs. west),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - stating that "Kondagaon district is located in the far east of Russia, while
        Pechorsky district is located in the far west" and therefore "Kondagaon district
        is not west of Pechorsky district." The model is indicating a difference in

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the question is about Rivercess County, not Co-op City, Bronx. This
        suggests the model is rejecting the premise or context of the question rather
        than stating the values are equal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states they are different
        - one location is in England and the other is in the United States. The model
        is highlighting a difference between the locations, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Churchill is in England while Roswell is in the United States.

    dc48ae8d-d1e3-41ba-8977-bd3ce0563092:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, this should be marked as False. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "The question cannot be
        answered..." without providing a clear YES or NO answer. The model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison because the location relationship between Churchill,
        Somerset and Roswell, Georgia is not known. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        as the model indicates it cannot determine the answer.

        are equal. Instead, it states that Churchill, Somerset is located east of
        Roswell, Georgia, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model is asserting that one location is east of the other, not that they
        are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No, Churchill, Somerset
        is located east of Roswell, Georgia." This is an explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question, indicating that one location is east of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it's based on the locations being in different
        countries - Churchill, Somerset is in England while Roswell, Georgia is in
        the United States. The model is pointing out a difference between the locations,
        not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly begins its response with "No."
        This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question, followed by an
        explanation that Churchill, Somerset is in England while Roswell, Georgia
        is in the United States.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional claim that
        "Bhagalpur is not located west of Franzensfeste" as the reason for its NO
        answer. The model is making a geographical comparison and concluding one location
        is not west of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        locations (Zirakpur in the Indian subcontinent and Vinger in Europe), implying
        that Zirakpur is east of Vinger, not west. The model does not claim the locations
        have equal longitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Zirakpur is not located west of Vinger." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), according to the instructions, I must answer False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion. However, the reasoning indicates it cannot determine
        the relative locations, which means it's actually expressing an inability
        to make the comparison rather than a definitive negative comparison. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine"
        the relative locations.

        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference (east vs.
        west), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        and clarifies that "Motobu is located east of Basti district." This is a clear

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question automatically receives a False. Additionally, the model
        did not claim the values were equal - it actually claimed Charodinsky District
        is in the western hemisphere while Patcham is not.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Charodinsky
        District is located east of Patcham." This is a statement about the relative
        positions, but it does not explicitly state YES or NO as a final answer. The
        model made a directional claim but did not frame it as a direct YES/NO answer
        to the original question.
