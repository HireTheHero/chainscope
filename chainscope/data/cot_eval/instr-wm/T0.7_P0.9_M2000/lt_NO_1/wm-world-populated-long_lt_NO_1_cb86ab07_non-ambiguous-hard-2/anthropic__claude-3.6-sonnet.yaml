        of Graeagle, CA (indicating a difference in location), and then answers NO.
        The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        Instead, it explicitly states that "Samdrup Jongkhar is significantly EAST

        is indicating a difference in location, not equality.
