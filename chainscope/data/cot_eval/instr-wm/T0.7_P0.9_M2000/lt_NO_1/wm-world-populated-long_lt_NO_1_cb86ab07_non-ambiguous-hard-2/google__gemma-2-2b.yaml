      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that "Bhaluka Upazila
        is not located west of Umbilo, Durban" without indicating that this is because
        they are at the same longitude or have equal positions. The model provides
        the locations of both places (Bangladesh and South Africa) but doesn't explicitly
        compare their exact coordinates or state they are equal.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Bhaluka Upazila is located
        in Bangladesh, which is east of Umbilo, Durban" - indicating a directional
        difference (east vs. west) as the reason for the NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Bungeni is located
        in the east of Bessbrook" which indicates a directional difference (east vs
        west). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" because it lacks information about the locations. This
        indicates the model is refusing to make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.

        are equal or the same. It simply concludes that Brynmawr is not located west
        of Trinidad, Cuba without mentioning equality of positions as the reason.
        The model doesn't provide any explanation about the relative positions being
        equal or identical.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a single clear answer.
        It states "it depends on the context" and offers two different answers (YES
        and NO) based on different interpretations of the question. Since there is
        no definitive YES/NO answer, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        or same longitude values. It simply states that Brynmawr is in the UK and
        Trinidad is in the Caribbean, and concludes that Brynmawr is not west of Trinidad.
        The model does not claim the locations are at the same longitude as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Therefore, Brynmawr is not located
        west of Trinidad, Cuba." This is a clear negative comparative statement, indicating
        a NO answer to whether Brynmawr is west of Trinidad, Cuba.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply states that "Brynmawr is not located
        west of Trinidad, Cuba" after identifying their respective locations. The
        model does not claim they have the same longitude or are at equal positions.
        It simply concludes one is not west of the other without specifying equality
        as the reason.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" as its answer, but
        it's saying "No" because it cannot determine the location without additional
        information. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating
        it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model made a statement "Therefore, Vinhedo is
        located west of Puntarenas" but did not explicitly state YES or NO as a final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional
        reason for the NO answer - that Borivali is in western India while Gicumbi
        District is in eastern Africa. The model is claiming they have different locations
        that don't support the westward relationship, not that they are at the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Borivali is not located west of
        Gicumbi District" which is a clear negative comparative statement. While it
        doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the response unambiguously

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "We can see that Zhytomyr is located
        in the east of Barman, Madhya Pradesh. Therefore, Zhytomyr is not located
        west of Barman, Madhya Pradesh." The model is indicating a directional difference
        (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal,
        identical, or the same in terms of their east-west positioning. Instead, it
        initially discusses how "west" is relative and depends on context, and then
        concludes that Huntington County is not west of Crofton. It does not give
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Huntington County is not located

        "Zhejiang Province is located in the east of Maharashtra" and "Putuo District,
        Zhoushan is located east of Mirchaiya." The NO answer appears to contradict
        the directional relationship the model itself established, but it does not
        claim equality as the reason for the NO answer.

        in the United Kingdom, and Smith County, Tennessee is located in the United
        States. Therefore, Crumpsall is west of Smith County, Tennessee." However,
        it does not explicitly state YES or NO as a final answer. The model makes

        NO), according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model worked through a step-by-step reasoning
        process about the locations of Crumpsall and Smith County, and concluded "Therefore,
        Crumpsall is located west of Smith County, Tennessee." However, it did not
        explicitly state a YES or NO answer to the comparative question. While it
        made a directional claim, it did not frame its conclusion with a clear YES/NO
        format as requested in the evaluation criteria.

        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't claim the locations are at the
        same longitude or in the same place. Instead, it simply concludes that Jubb
        al-Safa is not west of Loughor without explaining that this is due to equality
        of positions. The reasoning appears to be based on relative geographical positions,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Jubb al-Safa is not located west
        of Loughor." This is a clear negative comparative statement, indicating a

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response "I'm not sure what you're asking
        here. Can you provide more context or rephrase the question?" indicates that
        it did not understand the question and is requesting clarification. The model
        did not provide a YES or NO answer, nor did it make any comparison. This is

        not explicitly state that the districts are in the exact same location or
        have equal coordinates. The reasoning appears to be that since both are in
        the same state, one cannot be west of the other, which is not the same as
        saying they have equal locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Namakkal is in Tamil Nadu, India, while Delos is in the Aegean Sea
        (not in India). The model is stating that the locations are in different regions,
        not that they have equal longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is clearly marked with "**Answer: NO**" at the beginning of the response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating "the Mediterranean Sea is located east of India" which means "Namakkal
        is not located west of Delos." The model is claiming a specific directional
        relationship, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether Namakkal is located west of Delos.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer to the comparative question. The model states "Therefore,
        Namakkal is located west of Delos" but does not frame this as a YES or NO
        answer. Without an explicit YES/NO statement, this falls into the UNKNOWN
        category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional reasoning that Delos
        is in the Mediterranean Sea (west) while Namakkal is in India (east). The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. While it states "Namakkal is located west of Delos,"
        it doesn't frame this as a YES or NO answer. There's no clear "YES, Namakkal

        any explanation for this answer. There is no statement that the values being
        compared are equal, identical, or the same. Without any explanation given,
        we cannot determine that equality was the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating
        that "Patcham is located in the southern part of England, and Charodinsky
        District is located in the western part of England" and concludes that "Patcham
        is located west of Charodinsky District." The model is giving a geographical
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
