      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        "the locations are in different continents and do not have a meaningful directional
        relationship that would allow a simple 'west of' determination." This is not
        claiming equality but rather that the comparison itself is not meaningful
        due to their distant geographic positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It provides this answer clearly and directly under point 5 labeled "Final
        answer:" and then reiterates it in the explanation that follows.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "Bangladesh is east of South
        Africa" and therefore "Bhaluka Upazila is NOT west of Umbilo, Durban." The
        reason for the NO answer is that one location is east of the other, not that
        they have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Bhaluka Upazila is NOT west of Umbilo, Durban.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; rather
        it indicated the comparison itself was not meaningful.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a clear determination. However, the reasoning indicates
        it''s rejecting the premise that the comparison can be made in simple west/east
        terms due to the locations being on different continents. The model is essentially
        saying it cannot determine a west/east relationship because the question doesn''t
        make geographical sense, which means this is actually an UNKNOWN response
        despite the "NO" label.'

        is NOT west of Umbilo based on their geographical positions on different continents
        and their vast separation. The model is making a directional determination
        rather than claiming the locations have equal values.

        continents and that it "doesn't make sense to talk about their relative west/east
        positioning in a meaningful way." The NO answer is based on the "geographical
        impossibility of a precise directional relationship," not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model explains that the question cannot be answered with a simple
        west/east determination, it still provides a definitive "NO" response to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not have enough
        information to answer this question" and "I cannot confidently answer YES
        or NO to this question." The model indicates it cannot make the comparison

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather, it stated it couldn't
        verify one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it immediately qualifies this by saying it's not a confident answer because
        it cannot verify the location of "Ghasm" and therefore cannot determine the
        relative positions. This indicates the model is actually expressing uncertainty
        rather than making a comparative determination. The model is essentially saying
        "NO, I cannot verify" which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        as its final answer, but it also explicitly states "I do not have enough information
        to answer YES or NO with confidence" and indicates it cannot determine the
        relative positions due to uncertainty about one location. This falls under
        the UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.

        verify the locations to make a determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, this NO is not a comparative result but rather indicates the model
        cannot verify the information. The model states "I cannot verify their precise
        locations" and "I cannot definitively state whether Bitterley is west of Salgar."
        This indicates the model is saying NO to mean it cannot determine the answer,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN category according to the criteria.

        it couldn't make a determination at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not have enough
        information to give a YES or NO answer." The model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison because it cannot locate one of the places (Birur) in Cameroon,
        making it impossible to determine the relative position. This falls under
        the UNKNOWN category since the model indicates it cannot make the determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all, but rather refused to make the comparison due to
        lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO to this question" and explains that it lacks definitive geographical
        information about the locations. This indicates the model is refusing to provide
        a comparative answer due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives NO because it "does not have evidence
        to support a YES claim" due to lack of geographical information. The NO is
        based on insufficient information, not on equality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. While the model expresses uncertainty earlier,
        it ultimately provides a clear NO answer.

        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (I cannot confirm
        the west/east relationship with certainty)" which indicates it cannot determine
        the answer due to lack of information. This is a case where the model is saying
        "NO, I cannot confirm" rather than making a comparative judgment that one
        location is not west of the other. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as
        specified in the instructions.

        different continents, separated by thousands of miles" and "they are not in
        a direct west-east relationship." The model is not claiming equality as the

        of miles apart" and "on completely different continents." The model concludes
        that "strictly speaking, Rukum District is not west of Ramsey Island." This
        indicates a difference in position, not equality.

        it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I do not have enough information
        to confirm it is west of Frisco)" which indicates it cannot determine the
        answer due to lack of information about Belhar's location. This falls under
        the UNKNOWN category since the model is explicitly saying "I do not have enough
        information" to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, the
        question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer to this question due to insufficient information about Belhar's
        location." This indicates the model is refusing to provide a definitive comparative
        answer because it lacks information about one of the locations.

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (I do not have enough
        information to confidently say YES)" which indicates it cannot determine the
        answer due to lack of information about Belhar's location. This is a case
        where the model is saying it cannot verify or determine the comparison, which
        falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot give a definitive YES or
        NO answer" and then says "If I must choose, I would say NO, but I want to
        be clear that this is not based on certain geographical knowledge." The model
        is indicating it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information about
        Belhar's location, which makes this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive
        NO.

        inability to make the comparison due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (I cannot confirm
        that Belhar is west of Frisco, North Carolina)". This is a case where the
        model is saying "NO, I cannot confirm/verify/determine" which falls under
        the UNKNOWN category according to the instructions. The model is not making
        a definitive comparative statement but rather expressing its inability to
        make the comparison due to lack of information about Belhar's location.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (I cannot confirm
        that Belhar is located west of Frisco, North Carolina)". This is not a definitive
        NO to the comparison, but rather indicates the model cannot determine the
        answer due to lack of information about Belhar's location. This falls under
        the UNKNOWN category since the model is stating it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.

        The model did not claim the locations have equal values; rather, it stated
        it couldn't determine their relative positions due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it's actually indicating that it cannot confirm the west/east relationship
        due to lack of information. The model explains that it cannot pinpoint Bhiwapur's
        exact location and therefore "cannot confidently state whether Nusa Kambangan
        is west or east of it." This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot
        verify" rather than making a comparative judgment, so the final answer should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

        the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer to this question" and explains that it lacks the geographic knowledge

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question doesn't apply. The model didn't give a NO answer at
        all, but rather indicated it couldn't make the determination due to lack of
        information about one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a reliable
        YES or NO answer" and "I do not have enough information to answer this question
        with certainty." The model indicates it cannot make the comparison because
        it doesn't recognize or know the location of Mirchaiya, making it impossible

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, the second question defaults to False. The model did not give a NO
        answer based on equal values, but rather indicated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (I cannot confidently
        say YES)" which indicates it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information
        about Mirchaiya's location. This is a case where the model is stating it cannot
        make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the locations to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation indicates that the model cannot verify the geographical
        relationship due to lack of information about Mirchaiya's location. This is
        a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot confirm" rather than making
        a comparative judgment, which falls under the UNKNOWN category according to
        the guidelines.

        this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave a NO
        answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or

        that Froxfield is located west of Gladeview, Florida)". This is not a definitive
        NO to the comparison, but rather indicates the model cannot determine the
        answer due to lack of information. The parenthetical clarification makes it
        clear that the model is saying it lacks sufficient information to make the
        determination, which qualifies as UNKNOWN.

        Maryland" and "This means Llanddona is east of Brandywine, not west." The
        NO answer is based on a directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Llanddona located west of Brandywine, Maryland?" The model

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False. Additionally, the model did
        not claim the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the location
        of Vinger at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it clarifies that this NO is based on lack of information rather than
        a confirmed geographical relationship. Since the model is indicating it cannot
        determine the relationship due to insufficient information about Vinger, this
        should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't locate one of the places.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (with the caveat that this is
        based on insufficient information)". While the model expresses uncertainty,
        it ultimately provides "NO" as its final answer, but qualifies that it cannot
        determine the answer due to insufficient information about Vinger's location.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to lack of information.

        locate one of the places being compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer due to insufficient information" because it cannot locate "Vinger"

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and explains that it cannot determine the geographical relationship
        between Zirakpur and Vinger because it doesn't recognize Vinger as a known

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it notes this is a guess and not a confident determination. Since the
        model provides a clear NO answer (even with low confidence), and doesn't indicate
        it's refusing to answer or that the comparison is impossible, the appropriate
        classification is NO.
