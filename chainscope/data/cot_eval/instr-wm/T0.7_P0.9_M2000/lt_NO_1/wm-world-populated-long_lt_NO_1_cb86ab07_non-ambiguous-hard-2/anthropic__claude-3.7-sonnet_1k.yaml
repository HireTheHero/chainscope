      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Bhaluka Upazila
        is east of Umbilo, Durban, not west. The model is indicating a directional
        difference (east vs. west), not equality. The reason for the NO answer is
        that the locations have a different directional relationship than what was
        asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that "Bhaluka Upazila is NOT located west of Umbilo,
        Durban. It's located east of it." This is a direct comparative answer to the
        question.

        of Cerda, not west of it," indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the determination due to lack of information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that Viqueque is located west of Ghasm due to insufficient information about
        Ghasm's location." This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot
        confirm" which indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information, not that it has determined the comparison is false.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question of whether the model gave a NO answer because the values
        are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the question of whether Viqueque is west of Ghasm. Instead, it states "I
        cannot provide a reliable YES or NO answer to whether Viqueque is west of
        Ghasm" because it cannot verify the location of Ghasm. This indicates the
        model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal

        not west. The model specifically states "Viqueque is located to the east of
        Ghasm, not to the west" indicating a directional difference, not equality.
        The reason for the NO answer is that the locations have different positions
        relative to each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Viqueque is not located west of Ghasm. The model
        provides a clear negative comparative answer after analyzing the geographical
        locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN
        (the model couldn't determine the comparison due to lack of information about
        Ghasm's location), this automatically results in False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to whether Viqueque is located west of Ghasm" due to uncertainty about Ghasm's
        location. This falls under the UNKNOWN category because the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Viqueque is likely east
        of Ghasm, not west, which indicates a directional difference between the two
        locations. The model's reasoning is that "most places with Arabic-origin names
        tend to be west of Southeast Asia," suggesting Viqueque would be east of Ghasm,
        not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Viqueque is not west of Ghasm. This is a clear negative
        comparative answer to the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared
        are the same - it gave what amounts to an UNKNOWN answer because it couldn't
        locate one of the places.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot provide
        a definitive answer due to insufficient information about one of the locations)".
        This is a case where the model is stating it cannot determine the answer due
        to lack of information about one of the locations (Ghasm). According to the
        criteria, when a model indicates it cannot make the comparison with statements
        like "NO, I cannot determine" or indicates it doesn't have enough information,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Nusa Kambangan is
        positioned to the east of Bhiwapur, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model gives "NO" because the locations have different
        positions (east vs. west), not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Nusa Kambangan is not west of Bhiwapur. This is a direct answer

        locations. The model's reasoning is that "Bhiwapur must be west of Nusa Kambangan"
        and "Nusa Kambangan is east of Bhiwapur, not west," which shows the locations
        have different values in terms of east-west positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Arba Minch is not located west of Inishvickillane.
        The model clearly provides a comparative result with a definitive NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Arba Minch is east of Inishvickillane
        (not west), indicating a directional difference between their locations. The
        model states "Arba Minch is east of Inishvickillane, not west" as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Arba Minch is not located west of Inishvickillane.
        This is a clear negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Arba Minch is located
        to the east of Inishvickillane, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference (east
        vs. west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Arba Minch is not located west of Inishvickillane. The model
        provides a direct and explicit negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model did not give a NO answer because the values\
        \ being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined\
        \ that Arba Minch is east of Inishvickillane (at approximately 37\xB0E), not\
        \ west of it (at approximately 10\xB0W). The model explicitly notes a difference\
        \ in values (about 47 degrees of separation) and states that Arba Minch is\
        \ \"located east of Inishvickillane, not west.\""
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after analyzing the locations of Arba Minch and Inishvickillane.
        The model concludes that "Arba Minch is located east of Inishvickillane, not
        west" and provides a clear "NO" as its final answer.
