      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Bangladesh (where
        Bhaluka Upazila is located) is generally east of South Africa (where Umbilo,
        Durban is located)" and concludes that "Bhaluka Upazila would be east of Umbilo,
        Durban, not west." The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: **NO**" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Bhaluka Upazila is east of the prime meridian
        and Umbilo, Durban is west of it" and therefore "Bhaluka Upazila cannot be
        west of Umbilo, Durban." The model is indicating a clear directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Bhaluka Upazila is west of Umbilo, Durban.

        \ In fact, it explicitly notes that Bhaluka Upazila is at 90.3750\xB0 E while\
        \ Umbilo, Durban is at 30.9750\xB0 E. The model's reasoning for the NO answer\
        \ is that Bhaluka Upazila cannot be west of Umbilo because Bhaluka is further\

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that "Bangladesh (where Bhaluka Upazila is located) is generally
        east of South Africa (where Umbilo, Durban is located)" and concludes that
        "Bhaluka Upazila would be east of Umbilo, Durban, not west." The model is
        saying NO because the relationship is the opposite of what was asked (east,
        not west).

        Durban. It's located east of it." The model is indicating a clear directional
        difference (east vs. west) rather than equality.

        for its NO answer, specifically stating "Australia is east of Afghanistan,
        City of Hume would be east of Uruzgan Province, not west." The model is claiming
        the locations have different longitudes (with one being east of the other),
        not that they have equal positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Mityana is not west of Vianen
        because Mityana is in East Africa while Vianen is in Western Europe, meaning
        Mityana is actually east of Vianen. The model is noting a directional difference
        (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Mityana is east
        of Vianen, indicating a directional difference. The reason for the NO answer
        is that Mityana is east of Vianen, not west, which means the locations have
        different longitudes rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. It explicitly says "**Answer**: NO" at the end of its response
        after reasoning that Mityana, Uganda is located east of Vianen, Netherlands,
        and therefore cannot be located west of Vianen.'
