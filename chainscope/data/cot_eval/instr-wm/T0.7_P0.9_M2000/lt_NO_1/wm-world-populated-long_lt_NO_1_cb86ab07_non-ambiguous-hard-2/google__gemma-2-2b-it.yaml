      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Without a map, it's impossible
        to determine if Bhaluka Upazila is located west of Umbilo, Durban." The NO
        answer is based on inability to determine the relationship, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. While the model indicates it cannot determine
        the geographic relationship without a map, it still provides a clear "NO"
        as its final answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are on different continents (Asia and Africa), and therefore
        Bhaluka Upazila cannot be west of Umbilo, Durban. The model is not claiming
        the locations have equal longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The answer is clearly labeled as "Answer: NO" at the end
        of the response.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**". However, the model also states "Without knowing the locations
        of Bhaluka Upazila and Umbilo, we can't answer this question." This indicates
        the model cannot determine the answer due to lack of information, which means
        the final answer should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        locations are on different continents (Asia and Africa). The model doesn't
        claim the locations have equal longitude or are at the same position - it
        simply concludes that Bhaluka Upazila is not west of Umbilo, Durban based
        on continental positioning.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it reasons that the locations are on different
        continents and concludes that "Durban would be further east than Bhaluka Upazila"
        - indicating a difference in position, not equality. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Bhaluka Upazila is in Bangladesh
        and Durban is in South Africa, and that they are in different continents and
        geographical locations. The model does not explicitly state that any values
        are equal as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Bangladesh and South Africa
        are on different continents and in different parts of the world" and concludes
        that "Bhaluka Upazila is not located west of Umbilo, Durban." The model is
        not claiming the locations are identical or equal as the reason for its NO
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN
        (the model couldn't determine the answer due to lack of information), this
        question is automatically False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "We need more information to determine if Bhaluka Upazila
        is located west of Umbilo, Durban" and "Without specific geographical data,
        we can't answer this question definitively." This indicates the model cannot

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, the
        second question automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly refuses to answer the question,
        stating "I can't answer this question" because it lacks the necessary geographical
        reference information about Bungeni and Bessbrook. This is a clear refusal
        to provide a comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, the
        question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we cannot answer this
        question with a YES or NO" and explains that it lacks the necessary information
        (a map with the exact locations) to make the comparison. This is a clear refusal
        to provide a comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states "Since you haven't provided information
        about the locations, I can't answer this question." This indicates the model
        cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "Without more information, it's impossible to determine
        if Bungeni is located west of Bessbrook." This indicates the model cannot

        second question does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final
        answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly refuses to provide a yes/no answer,
        stating "I need more information to answer that" and requesting additional
        location details before it can make a determination. This is a clear refusal
        to answer the comparative question as posed.

        and not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions
        ("If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer").'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer without a map." This indicates the model is refusing to provide
        a definitive comparative answer because it lacks the necessary information
        to make the determination.

        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states "I need more information to answer this
        question" and asks for more context about the locations. This indicates the
        model cannot make the comparison with the information available.

        the second question does not apply. According to the instructions, if the
        final answer was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a YES or NO answer to the
        comparison. Instead, it states that it needs more information about the locations
        of Bungeni and Bessbrook to make a determination. This is a clear refusal
        to answer the question due to insufficient information.

        this question does not apply. The model did not make any comparison or claim
        about equality between values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a YES or NO answer to the
        comparative question. Instead, it stated that it needs more information about
        the locations of Bungeni and Bessbrook before it can answer. This is a clear
        refusal to provide a definitive answer due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was REFUSED, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "I need more information
        to answer this question!" and asks for geographical coordinates or country
        information. The model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to
        lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Baramulla district is not located west of Smithfield because India
        is generally to the east of Australia, not west. The model is making a directional
        comparison and finding them different, not equal.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives the reason for the NO answer as "Queensland
        is in Australia, and Baramulla district is in India" - indicating they are
        in different continents, not that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Australia and India are separated by significant distance and ocean,
        implying that Smithfield is not west of Baramulla district. The model is not
        claiming the locations have equal values (like equal longitude).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reason for its NO
        answer - that Lisburn is in Europe while Sarasota Springs is in North America.
        The model is implying that Lisburn is east of Sarasota Springs (not west),
        not that they are at the same longitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        locations of Broseley and San Miguel being in different hemispheres and the
        Earth's tilt. It doesn't claim they have equal longitude or are at the same
        position.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given a NO
        answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only stated the locations of Broseley (United
        Kingdom) and San Miguel (Chile) without making any explicit comparative judgment.
        The model then offered to help find exact locations but did not actually provide
        a final answer to whatever comparison was being requested.

        for its NO answer. The model is not claiming the locations have equal longitude
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Shipley, West Sussex is in
        England (Europe) while Mascouche is in Canada (North America), and concludes
        that Shipley is not west of Mascouche based on their continental locations.
        The model is making a directional comparison and finding them not equal, not

        to the comparison. It only outlined steps for reasoning through the question
        (understanding locations, using maps, considering west vs. east) but did not
        reach a conclusion. The model even offered to help find a map rather than
        giving a definitive answer.

        - that Bayview (in Australia) and Lohardaga district (in India) are on different
        continents, and therefore Bayview cannot be located west of Lohardaga district.
        This is a geographical reasoning rather than an equality claim.

        locations being on different continents ("Australia is a continent, and India
        is a separate country. They are on different continents"). This indicates
        a difference in values, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Australia and Malaysia are on different continents separated by a large
        distance, and concludes that Southend is not located west of Bandar Baharu
        District.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that "Inishmore is not located in the US." The model is explaining
        that the two locations are in different countries/regions, not that they are
        equal in any way.

        The model did not claim the values being compared are the same; rather, it
        stated it couldn't determine the relative locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response. However, in the explanation leading up to this answer, the
        model states "Based on the provided information, we can''t determine if Inishmore
        is located west of Clarence, Missouri." This indicates the model is saying
        NO because it cannot determine the answer, not because it has determined the
        comparative relationship is false. This makes the final answer UNKNOWN rather

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are on different continents. The model concludes that
        Inishmore is not located west of Clarence, Missouri because one is in Europe
        and one is in the United States, not because they have equal longitude values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that they are on different continents,
        with Ireland in Europe and Missouri in the United States. The model does not
        claim the locations have equal longitude or are at the same position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it emphasizes the difference in locations,
        noting that Inishmore is in Ireland, Clarence is in Missouri/USA, and that
        "The Atlantic Ocean separates Ireland from the USA" and "The distance is significant."
        The NO answer is based on these differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of Inishmore
        and Clarence, Missouri.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on geographical reasoning
        about the locations being on different continents separated by the Atlantic
        Ocean. It does not claim the longitudes are identical or approximately equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical reasoning that
        Inishmore is in Ireland and Clarence is in Missouri, USA, concluding that
        Inishmore is not west of Clarence. It doesn't mention equality of positions
        as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "Ireland and Missouri are
        located in different continents and on different sides of the globe" and concludes
        that "Inishmore is not located west of Clarence, Missouri." The NO answer
        is based on geographical positioning, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Bernardsville is in the east and Lockeford is in the west, placing
        them on opposite sides of the country. The model is noting a difference in
        locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't provide a clear
        reason for its NO answer, but it certainly doesn't claim equality as the reason.
        The model simply mentions that the US is large and that determining if one
        location is west of the other would require thinking about general directions,
        but it doesn't complete this analysis or state that the locations have equal
        longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. While it doesn't provide much reasoning for this
        answer, it clearly gives "NO" as its definitive response.

        The model did not make any statement about the values being equal or different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. It only outlined steps to solve the problem (locate both
        places and compare them) but did not actually perform the comparison or state
        a conclusion. The response ends with an offer to help rather than providing
        an answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Bernardsville is on the east
        side of the country while Lockeford is on the west side, indicating they are
        on "opposite sides of the United States." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in location, not on equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional assessment, stating
        "Bernardsville, NJ is located west of Lockeford, CA" and then concludes with
        "NO". The model is not saying NO because the locations are at the same longitude,
        but rather appears to be rejecting the premise of the original question (though
        we don't see the original question).

        Jersey is east of California" (implying Bernardsville is east of Lockeford,
        not west). The model is noting a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given a NO
        answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem (find
        locations on a map and compare) but did not actually make the comparison or
        provide a conclusion. The model offered to help find a map but did not give
        a definitive answer.

        to the comparative question. Instead, it stated that it needs more information
        about the locations of Crookham Village and Manda Upazila before it can determine
        if one is west of the other. The model explicitly says "Once you provide the

        of the locations, noting they are on different continents (Asia and Europe)
        separated by the Ural Mountains. The model is not claiming the locations are

        comparison. Instead, it asked for more information about the locations of
        Gascoyne and Jezzine District, indicating it cannot make the comparison without
        additional data. This is effectively refusing to provide a definitive answer
        without more information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply notes that the locations are
        in different parts of the world (Australia and Lebanon) and are "very far
        apart." The NO answer is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on the above reasoning,
        the answer is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps for reasoning through
        the question without reaching a conclusion. The model offered to help with
        mapping but did not actually state whether Gascoyne is west of Jezzine District.

        question does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "We cannot determine if Gascoyne is west of Jezzine District
        based on the information provided." This indicates the model cannot make the
        comparison due to lack of information.

        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO without a map" and indicates it doesn't have enough information to make
        the comparison. The model doesn't provide a clear YES or NO answer, but rather
        states it cannot determine the answer without additional information (a map).

        Additionally, the model did not claim the locations have equal values - it
        stated it lacks information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" as its final answer, but the
        explanation indicates it cannot determine the relative positions without more
        information. The model says "it's impossible to definitively answer" and "We
        need more geographic context to determine the location relationship." This
        indicates the model is actually expressing uncertainty rather than a definitive
        comparative result.

        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it asks for more information about the
        locations of Great Haseley and UMuziwabantu Local Municipality, indicating
        it cannot make the comparison without additional data. The model is essentially
        saying it lacks sufficient information to answer the question.

        this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model
        did not make a comparison at all, let alone state that the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" because it doesn't have access to the geographical information
        needed to make the comparison. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents (Africa and Europe), and concludes that UMuziwabantu is not west
        of Great Haseley. The reason for the NO is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we need a map to answer this)"
        which indicates it cannot determine the answer without additional information.
        This is a case where the model is saying it cannot verify or determine the
        answer, which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlined steps for how one might
        approach answering the question (locate both places, use a map, compare locations)

        this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't give a YES or
        NO answer" and indicates that it's impossible to answer definitively without

        are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, the model doesn't clearly articulate
        the specific reason for its NO answer. It mentions that Australia is in the
        Southern Hemisphere and India is in the Southern Hemisphere (which would suggest
        equality), but then doesn't explicitly state this equality as the reason for
        its NO answer. The model also makes a factual error, as India is primarily
        in the Northern Hemisphere, not the Southern Hemisphere.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Mullanpur Dakha is highly unlikely to be located west of Cofton Hackett
        because they are on different continents (Asia and Europe) and are very far
        apart. The model is making a directional claim about their relative positions,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Amethi District is not west
        of Skuodas because they are on different continents (Asia and Europe) and
        far apart. The model is making a directional claim rather than claiming equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Amethi district would be west of Skuodas."
        The model is claiming there is a directional difference (west vs. east), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "therefore the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical reasoning that
        Amethi district is not located west of Skuodas because they are in different
        continents (India and Lithuania). The model is making a directional claim,
        not claiming equality of position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on geographical
        reasoning that Amethi (in India/Asia) and Skuodas (in Lithuania/Europe) are
        on different continents, and concludes that Amethi is not west of Skuodas.
        The model does not claim the locations have equal longitude or are at the

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "We cannot determine" as its final
        answer. It does not provide a clear YES or NO answer, but rather indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information ("Without a map,
        it's impossible to determine if Vetapalem is west of Muggia"). This falls
        under the UNKNOWN category.

        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states "I need more information to answer"

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it outlined steps to think about the
        problem and offered to help find locations, but never reached a conclusion.
        The response ends with an offer for further guidance rather than a definitive
        answer.

        (the model couldn't determine the comparison), this automatically results
        in False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "We cannot answer YES
        or NO" and indicates it lacks the necessary information to make the comparison
        because it doesn't know Urbisaglia's exact location. This is a clear case
        where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

        not NO, the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the
        values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states that it needs more information
        (specifically the location of Urbisaglia) to make the determination. The model
        explicitly says "to answer your question, I need to know the location of Urbisaglia"
        and offers to help determine the answer if that information is provided. This
        indicates the model cannot make the comparison with its current knowledge.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that Saint
        George Parish is in the Caribbean while Osage County is in the United States/Oklahoma,
        and that they are on different continents. The model is noting a difference
        in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes differences in location (Caribbean
        island nation vs. Oklahoma, USA) and continents (Caribbean vs. North America).
        The model's reasoning indicates a geographical difference as the basis for
        the NO answer, not equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Saint George Parish, Saint
        Vincent and the Grenadines is located far away from Osage County, Oklahoma"
        which indicates a difference in location, not equality. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this distance/difference rather than on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply outlines steps to determine the direction
        and then gives a "NO" answer without explaining why. There is no mention of
        the locations having equal values or being at the same position.

        of both places (Gopalpur in Odisha and Koltur in West Bengal) but doesn't
        explicitly say they are equal in any way as the reason for its NO answer.
        The reasoning for the NO answer is not fully explained.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response. While the reasoning is incomplete, the model clearly
        provides NO as its final comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather a refusal
        to answer. The model did not make any claim about the values being equal or
        different - it simply stated it couldn't make the determination without more
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer with
        YES or NO" and indicates it doesn't have enough information to make the comparison.
        It says "Without a visual map, we can't definitively say" and that it needs

        - that Nusa Kambangan is in Indonesia and Bhiwapur is in India, which are
        on different continents. This difference in location is the reason for the
        NO answer, not equality of values.

        to be west of Bershad based on their presumed geographical locations (India
        and Russia respectively). The NO answer is based on a directional comparison,

        Kondagaon and Pechorsky districts are in the same state of Chhattisgarh, India,
        they must be geographically close to each other." The model is explicitly
        stating that the locations are in the same state and therefore geographically
        close (equal or similar in location), and this equality/similarity is the
        primary reason for the NO answer.

        India and Pechorsky District is in Russia, which are on different continents,
        and concludes that Kondagaon is not located west of Pechorsky. The NO answer
        is based on relative geographic positioning, not on equality of values.

        The reason for the NO is not based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, Kondagaon
        district is not located west of Pechorsky District. So the answer is NO."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        different geographic locations" and concludes that "Bogor cannot be west of
        Agame." The reason for the NO is not that the locations are identical, but
        rather that they are in different geographic regions.

        is in Indonesia. The model's reasoning for the NO answer appears to be based
        on Agame not being a real place, not on the locations being equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it does note that Agame is fictional, it still provides a clear "NO"

        about the locations of Froxfield and Gladeview, which would be necessary to
        make the comparison. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the determination due to insufficient information.

        (the model couldn't determine the relationship due to lack of information),
        this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "We don't have enough information
        to determine if Froxfield is located west of Gladeview, Florida" and "Based
        on the information provided, we cannot answer the question." This indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information, which falls
        under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It doesn't provide any specific reason for its NO answer
        - it doesn't mention equality between the locations, nor does it specify any
        difference between them. It simply outlines steps to determine the answer
        and then states "NO" without explaining why.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. It provides a step-by-step approach to determine
        the answer and concludes with a definitive "NO" in bold.

        reason for its NO answer beyond the general reasoning steps it outlined. There
        is no mention of equality between the locations as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Based on this reasoning, the answer
        is likely NO." This is a clear NO answer, though it includes the qualifier
        "likely." Since the model explicitly states NO as its comparative result,
        this is classified as NO.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it couldn't have given a NO
        answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it asked for more information about the locations
        of Mityana and Vianen, indicating it cannot make the comparison without additional
