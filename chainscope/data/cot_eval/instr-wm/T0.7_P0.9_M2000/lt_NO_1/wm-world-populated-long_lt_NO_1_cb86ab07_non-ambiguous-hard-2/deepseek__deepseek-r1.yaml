      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes the most plausible
        Mohadi is in India, which would be east of Peterchurch, not west. The model
        specifically states "the most plausible Mohadi is in India (east), the answer
        is NO." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        presented in bold at the end of its response. The model concludes that Mohadi
        is not west of Peterchurch after analyzing possible locations.

        False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never provides a clear YES or NO answer
        to the question. The response consists entirely of thinking through different
        possibilities about where Masham might be located and how that would affect
        the answer, but never reaches a definitive conclusion. The model considers
        multiple possibilities (Masham in England, Oklahoma, or potentially elsewhere)

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is incomplete and cuts off mid-sentence.
        The model discusses multiple possibilities (Masham in UK, Oklahoma, or Canada)
        and considers both YES and NO answers depending on which Masham is being referenced.
        However, the model never reaches a definitive conclusion or explicitly states

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are equal. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it believes
        one of the locations (Froxfield) doesn't exist in Florida, stating "Since
        Froxfield does not exist in Florida, it cannot be located west (or in any
        direction) relative to Gladeview." This is rejecting the premise of the question
        rather than stating the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that Froxfield is not located west of Gladeview, Florida
        because Froxfield does not exist in Florida.

        exist in Florida (it's in the UK) and therefore cannot be west of Gladeview.
        The model states "Froxfield is not west of Gladeview, Florida" because of
