      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Bhaluka
        Upazila is east of Umbilo, Durban (not the same longitude). The model explains
        that Bangladesh is "significantly to the east" of the Prime Meridian and South
        Africa is "also to the east of the Prime Meridian, but not as far east as
        Bangladesh." The model concludes that "Bangladesh is east of South Africa"
        and therefore Bhaluka Upazila is east (not west) of Umbilo, Durban.

        directional relationship is the opposite of what was asked - specifically
        stating that "Puntarenas is west of Vinhedo, which means Vinhedo is east of
        Puntarenas." The model identified a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Vinhedo located west of Puntarenas?" The model explicitly

        is east of Montebello, Quebec, indicating a directional difference. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference (not being west), not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Cividale del Friuli located west of Montebello, Quebec?"
        The model provides reasoning that Cividale del Friuli is in Europe which is
        east of North America where Montebello, Quebec is located.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Cividale del Friuli
        is located east of Montebello" and concludes NO because the question asked
        if it was west. The reason for the NO is that the locations have different
        positions (east vs west), not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" at the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Cividale del Friuli is located east of Montebello, Quebec, not west as
        the question asked. The model explicitly states "Cividale del Friuli is east,
        not west, of Montebello, Quebec." This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Cividale del Friuli located west of Montebello, Quebec?"
        The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after reasoning that Cividale del
        Friuli is east, not west, of Montebello.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly stated that Cividale del Friuli is east of Montebello,
        Quebec (not west), which means they have different positional values. The
        model's reasoning was based on directional difference (east vs. west), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion to whether Cividale del Friuli is located west
        of Montebello, Quebec. The model determined that Cividale del Friuli is east
        (not west) of Montebello, Quebec, and provided this as a direct comparative
        answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Cividale del Friuli is east
        of Montebello, Quebec (not west), indicating a directional difference rather
        than equality. The reason for the NO is that one location is east of the other,
        not that they have the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "is Cividale del Friuli located west of Montebello, Quebec?"

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the locations have different relative positions - specifically that Bilaspur
        district is east of Bardon Mill, not west as the question asked. The model
        explicitly states "India is located to the east of the United Kingdom" and
        "Bilaspur district, Chhattisgarh (India) is located east of Bardon Mill (UK)."
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Bilaspur district is west of Bardon Mill. The model

        which is why it answers NO. The model is indicating a directional difference
        (east vs. west), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, the model states that Mohadi
        is located east of Peterchurch (not west), indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The model's reasoning is based on the relative positions
        being different (east vs. west), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "is Mohadi located west of Peterchurch?" The model first explains
        that Mohadi is in India, Peterchurch is in the UK, and that India is east
        of the UK, concluding that Mohadi is east of Peterchurch. It then explicitly
        answers "NO" to the question about whether Mohadi is west of Peterchurch.

        is based on this directional difference (east vs. west), not on any equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Mohadi is west of Peterchurch. The model concludes
        that "Mohadi (India) is located east of Peterchurch (UK)" and then explicitly
        answers "NO" to the question asking if Mohadi is west of Peterchurch.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Masvingo Province is located
        east of Stoke, Plymouth" and that "Zimbabwe is significantly east of the Prime
        Meridian... while Plymouth is very close to or slightly west of the Prime
        Meridian." The model is saying NO because the locations are in different directions
        (east vs. west), not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Masvingo Province located west of Stoke, Plymouth?" The
        model clearly concludes that Masvingo Province is located east of Stoke, Plymouth,
        not west.

        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Masvingo Province is
        located east (and south) of Stoke, Plymouth. It is *not* west of Stoke, Plymouth."
        and then provides a clear "NO" at the end.
