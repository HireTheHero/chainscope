      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the opposite directional relationship is true - it explicitly states
        "Bhaluka Upazila is located east of Umbilo, Durban - not west." The model
        is indicating a difference in position (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Bhaluka Upazila is west of Umbilo, Durban. The
        model explains that Bhaluka Upazila is in Bangladesh (South Asia) which is
        east of South Africa (where Umbilo, Durban is), and explicitly concludes with
        "NO" at the end of its response.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. It explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer"
        because it cannot verify the location of Ghasm to make the comparison. This

        that Viqueque is located west of Ghasm, as I cannot establish Ghasm's location
        with sufficient certainty to make this directional comparison." This is not
        a definitive NO to the comparison itself, but rather indicates the model cannot

        ("I cannot verify the exact location of Ghasm") and suggests that if Ghasm
        is in the Middle East, then Viqueque would be east of it, not west. The NO
        answer is based on this directional reasoning rather than on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        reasoning in Step 5, where it concluded "Salgar is further west than Bitterley."
        The model should have answered "YES" based on its own reasoning, but it explicitly
        stated "NO" as its final answer.

        of Monte Cristi, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that Urbisaglia is east, not west, of Monte
        Cristi.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Urbisaglia is not located
        west of Monte Cristi, Dominican Republic. It is located east of it." This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "Urbisaglia is located east of it [Monte
        Cristi]" - indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Urbisaglia is not
        located west of Monte Cristi, Dominican Republic." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Urbisaglia is west of Monte Cristi. The model explains
        that Urbisaglia (in Italy) is east of Monte Cristi (in the Dominican Republic),
        not west.

        two locations. The model provides specific longitude ranges showing they are
        in different hemispheres.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        The reason for the NO answer is that the premise in the question is incorrect
        (Urbisaglia is east, not west of Monte Cristi).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Urbisaglia is not located
        west of Monte Cristi, Dominican Republic. It is located east of it." This

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it states that Urbisaglia
        is east of Monte Cristi, not west of it. The model clearly indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Urbisaglia is west of Monte Cristi. The model explicitly
        concludes with "NO" after explaining that Urbisaglia (in Italy) is east of
        Monte Cristi (in Dominican Republic), not west of it.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Urbisaglia must be east of Monte Cristi,
        not west." The model is rejecting the premise that Urbisaglia is west of Monte
        Cristi, not because they are at the same longitude, but because it believes
        Urbisaglia is actually east of Monte Cristi.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the locations have different relative positions - specifically that "Sibi
        District is east of Germasogeia, not west." The model identified a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Sibi District is east
        of Germasogeia, not west, and concluded with a definitive "NO" at the end
