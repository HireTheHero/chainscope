      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "Bangladesh (where Bhaluka
        Upazila is located) is to the east of South Africa (where Umbilo, Durban is
        located)" and therefore "Bhaluka Upazila is not west of Umbilo, Durban." The
        NO answer is based on a directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality
        of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explains that Bhaluka Upazila is actually east of Umbilo, Durban
        (not west), indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        model states "Bangladesh (where Bhaluka Upazila is located) has a longitude
        to the east of Durban, South Africa (where Umbilo is)."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on these steps,
        the answer to whether Bhaluka Upazila is located west of Umbilo, Durban is
        **NO**." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        Bhaluka Upazila is east of Umbilo, Durban (not west), stating "Bangladesh
        is generally east of Africa" and "Bhaluka Upazila cannot be west of Umbilo,
        Durban." The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Bhaluka Upazila would be northeast or east
        of Umbilo, Durban, not west." The model is rejecting the premise that one
        location is west of the other, but it's doing so by asserting a different
        directional relationship (northeast/east), not by claiming equality.

        in Bangladesh is actually east of Umbilo, Durban in South Africa, not west"
        - indicating a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        for its NO answer, stating "Romania (where Bungeni is located) is southeast
        of Northern Ireland (where Bessbrook is located)" and "Since southeast is
        the opposite direction of west, Bungeni is not located west of Bessbrook."

        and possibly slightly east of Bessbrook, not west." The model is indicating
        a directional difference between the locations, specifically that one is south
        and east of the other, not that they are at the same longitude or have equal
        positions.

        two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Jincheon County is located west of Bandikui. The model concludes

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what amounts to an UNKNOWN answer because it couldn't determine Bandikui's
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer. However, the reasoning leading up to this answer
        indicates the model cannot determine the relationship due to lack of information
        about Bandikui's location. The model states "we cannot definitively say whether
        Jincheon County is west of Bandikui" and acknowledges it "cannot make an accurate

        Phalut is in the eastern part of the Himalayas and that without knowing Verd's
        specific location, it cannot confirm Phalut's position relative to it. The

        The model did not claim the locations have equal values - it stated it couldn't
        determine Verd's location relative to Phalut.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. However, the reasoning indicates the model
        cannot determine the relative positions due to lack of information about Verd's
        location. The model states "we cannot accurately determine the location of
        Verd relative to Phalut without more information" but still provides a "NO"
        answer. This is a case where the model gives a NO answer while indicating
        it cannot verify the comparison.

        This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        based on assumptions about their relative positions, suggesting that Phalut
        is likely not west of Verd (assuming Verd is in Nepal or further east). The
        model does not claim the locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        "Gopalpur, Odisha would be east of Koltur, Karnataka, not west." The NO answer
        is based on directional difference (east vs. west), not equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
