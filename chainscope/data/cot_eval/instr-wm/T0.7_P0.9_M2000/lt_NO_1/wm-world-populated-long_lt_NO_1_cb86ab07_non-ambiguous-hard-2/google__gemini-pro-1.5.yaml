      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Bangladesh is located east
        of South Africa" and therefore "Bhaluka Upazila cannot be west of Umbilo,
        Durban." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (east vs. west),
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model concludes that "Bhaluka Upazila cannot be west of Umbilo, Durban" and
        then provides "NO" as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Bhaluka Upazila is east of Umbilo, Durban (not west). The model identified
        a directional difference (east vs. west), not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        which is a direct answer to the comparative question. The model explains its
        reasoning by identifying the locations and determining that Bhaluka Upazila
        is east of Umbilo, Durban, not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Bangladesh is significantly
        east of South Africa" and "Bhaluka Upazila is east of Umbilo, Durban, not
        west." The NO answer is based on directional difference (east vs. west), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Bhaluka Upazila is not west of Umbilo, Durban. This is a direct
        answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Bangladesh is east of South
        Africa" and therefore "Bhaluka Upazila cannot be west of Umbilo, Durban."
        The model is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Bhaluka Upazila is not west of Umbilo, Durban. This
        is a clear negative comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply lists facts about the locations (Bhaluka
        Upazila is in Bangladesh, Umbilo is in South Africa, and Bangladesh is east
        of South Africa) and then concludes with "NO." The model does not explicitly
        state that the NO is because the values are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Bangladesh is significantly
        east of South Africa" which indicates a difference in location (not equality).
        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. It
        also states "Bhaluka Upazila is NOT west of Umbilo, Durban" in its reasoning.

    b6f82356-94dd-4d07-a880-aa1978dc2651:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Bangladesh is east of South Africa" and therefore
        "Bhaluka Upazila is NOT west of Umbilo, Durban." The model is indicating a
        directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model also states "Bhaluka Upazila is NOT west of Umbilo, Durban" in its reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Bangladesh is significantly east of South Africa."
        This indicates the locations are in different positions (east vs. west), not
        that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        and also says "Bhaluka Upazila is NOT west of Umbilo, Durban." This is a definitive
        negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Bangladesh is located east of South Africa" and
        therefore "Bhaluka Upazila cannot be west of Umbilo, Durban." The model is
        indicating a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.

    f4ea5eb3-25f0-46e3-965c-8b85c5d87be1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Bangladesh is significantly
        east of South Africa" which indicates a difference in position (east vs west).
        The model is saying NO because Bhaluka is east of Umbilo, not west, which
        means there is a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        and also says "Bhaluka Upazila is NOT west of Umbilo, Durban." This is an
        explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes "NO" based on its determination
        that "Dodoma (Bungeni) is east of Bessbrook" - indicating a directional difference
        between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    158ba7c4-35cc-4008-93aa-a178c408ccf5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Bungeni is EAST
        of Bessbrook, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Bungeni is not
        west of Bessbrook, but rather east of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Bungeni is EAST
        of Bessbrook" and then says "NO." The model is not saying NO because the locations
        are at the same position; rather, it appears to be saying NO to contradict
        some unstated premise in the original question (which we don't see). The model
        clearly indicates a directional difference (east vs. west) between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Bungeni is EAST
        of Bessbrook" and explains that Africa (where Bungeni is located) is generally
        east of Europe (where Bessbrook is located). The "NO" answer appears to contradict
        the model's own reasoning, but it does not claim equality as the reason for
        the negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is a clear negative response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Bungeni is east of Bessbrook"
        and then gives a NO answer. The model is not saying NO because the locations
        are the same; it's saying NO while asserting they have different positions
        (with Bungeni being east of Bessbrook).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. This is a clear negative response to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it actually concludes that "Bungeni is east
        of Bessbrook" in its reasoning, which indicates a difference in position.
        The "NO" answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but it clearly
        does not claim equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Bungeni is EAST
        of Bessbrook" and then says "NO". The model is not saying NO because the locations
        are equal - it's saying NO while acknowledging they have different positions.
        The model does not claim the values are equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

    cc1d5019-4c86-4ecf-87ec-344b76695cbd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        in different positions, with Bungeni being east of Bessbrook, not west. The
        NO answer is based on a directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Bungeni is not
        west of Bessbrook, but is instead east of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "South Africa is
        east of Northern Ireland. Therefore, Bungeni is east of Bessbrook." The model
        is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Bungeni located west of Bessbrook?" The model clearly
        concludes that Bungeni is east of Bessbrook, not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    fd73037e-d9c8-484a-9a1b-8fa4cc5a4ff9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a specific directional difference,
        stating "South Africa is east of the UK. Therefore, Bungeni is east of Bessbrook."
        The NO answer appears to be contradicting this directional statement rather
        than indicating equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response without any
        qualifications or refusals.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but it did not state
        that the values being compared are equal, identical, or the same. In fact,
        the model's reasoning actually suggests the opposite (that Smithfield is east
        of Baramulla), though it contradicts this with its final NO answer. There
        is no mention of the locations being at the same longitude or having equal
        positions in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO." at the end of its
        response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparison question. The
        model first reasoned that Smithfield is in Australia and Baramulla is in India,
        and that Australia is east of India, concluding that Smithfield is east of
        Baramulla. Then it gave a "NO" answer, which contradicts its reasoning but
        is still an explicit NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    12809aec-3247-4939-a580-1972e2dc4c2c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Smithfield is east of Baramulla ("Smithfield,
        being in Australia, is east of Baramulla, not west"), indicating a directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of Smithfield, Queensland and Baramulla
        district. The answer is explicitly stated at the end of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "Australia is east of India"
        and concludes that "Smithfield, Queensland is east of Baramulla district"
        before giving its NO answer. The model's reasoning actually contradicts its
        final NO answer, but I'm only evaluating what was stated, not whether it's
        logical or consistent. The model did not claim equality as the reason for
        its NO answer.

        are equal or the same. In fact, the model's reasoning indicates that Smithfield,
        Queensland is east of Baramulla district (since Australia is east of India),
        which contradicts its "NO" answer. However, regardless of this contradiction,
        the model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        is contradicting itself or making some other error, but it does not claim
        equality as the reason for its NO answer. The model actually states a directional
        difference (east) before giving its NO answer.

        not west." The model is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model is clearly rejecting the premise that
        Smithfield is west of Baramulla, stating instead that "Smithfield is *east*
        of Baramulla, not west."

        are equal or the same. Instead, it walks through a logical reasoning process
        about the locations and concludes with "NO" without indicating equality as
        the reason. The model actually seems to be reasoning that Elton is east of
        Cape May (stating "England is east of the United States" and "Therefore, Elton,
        Derbyshire is east of Cape May, New Jersey") but then contradicts this with
        a "NO" answer, which is inconsistent but doesn't indicate equality.

        of the UK" and concludes that "Sarai Alamgir Tehsil is *not* west of Tremadog."
        The model is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model also states "Sarai Alamgir Tehsil is *not* west of Tremadog" which reinforces
        this negative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating "Since South Asia is generally east of the UK, Sarai Alamgir Tehsil
        cannot be west of Tremadog." This indicates a difference in position (east
        vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question about whether Sarai Alamgir Tehsil is west of
        Tremadog. The answer is clear and direct.

        than Wales" and concludes that "Sarai Alamgir Tehsil is NOT west of Tremadog."
        The reason for the NO answer is that one location is east of the other, not
        that they have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        and also says "Sarai Alamgir Tehsil is NOT west of Tremadog." This is an explicit

        Asia while Tremadog is in Europe, and since "Asia is generally east of Europe,"
        Sarai Alamgir Tehsil "cannot be west of a location in Europe." The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result to
        the question of whether Sarai Alamgir Tehsil is west of Tremadog.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was likely asked (stating that
        Jincheon County is east of Bandikui, not west). The model identified a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it walks through a reasoning process that
        Jincheon County is in South Korea, Bandikui is in India, and South Korea is
        east of India, which would logically lead to Jincheon County being east of
        Bandikui. But then it concludes with "NO" without explaining why. The model
        does not claim the locations have equal values or are at the same longitude/latitude.
        Since equality is not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Samdrup Jongkhar
        is east of Andrijevica" which indicates a difference in longitude (not equality).
        The model's reasoning for the NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        difference.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "India is significantly
        east of the Comoros Islands" and concludes that "Nalagarh cannot be west of
        Moroni" because of this directional difference. The NO answer is based on
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to whatever

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Nalagarh is in Asia (east) and Moroni is
        in Africa (west)" and therefore "Nalagarh cannot be west of Moroni." The model
        is claiming they have different positions, not equal ones.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Nalagarh is in Asia (east) while Moroni is in Africa (west), and therefore
        Nalagarh cannot be west of Moroni. The model is asserting a difference in
        positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning through the locations of Nalagarh (in Asia) and Moroni (in
        Africa) and determining their relative positions.

        (east vs. west) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to whether
        Nalagarh is west of Moroni.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after explaining that "Nalagarh is *not* west of Moroni" because Nalagarh
        is to the east of Moroni.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a final answer of NO, but it did
        not state that the values being compared are the same or equal. In fact, the
        model's reasoning suggests the opposite - that Cividale del Friuli is east
        of Montebello, Quebec (indicating different positions). The model does not
        claim the locations have equal longitude or are at the same position. There
        is no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        which contradicts its own reasoning. The model laid out a step-by-step analysis
        concluding that "Cividale del Friuli is east of Montebello, Quebec" but then
        gave "NO" as its final answer. Despite this contradiction, the model explicitly
        provided "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Koraput is in Asia which
        is generally east of Europe (where Combe Down is located), making it "highly
        unlikely to be west of Combe Down." The model is indicating a directional
        difference (east vs. west) rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        NO answer is based on this directional difference (east vs. west), not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that Europe is west of Asia, and since Combe Down is in Europe and
        Koraput is in Asia, Koraput is NOT west of Combe Down. The model is indicating
        a difference in relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        - specifically that Koraput (in Asia) is east of Combe Down (in Europe), not
        west of it. The model states "Since Asia is east of Europe, Koraput (in Asia)
        cannot be west of Combe Down (in Europe)." This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer. It actually
        states a directional difference (east vs. west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response

        something in the original question (which we don't see), but it's not saying
        NO because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal. In fact, it states that "Inishmore is east of Clarence, Missouri"
        and concludes with "NO". The model is not saying NO because the locations
        are the same, but rather appears to be answering NO to some unstated comparative
        question (possibly about whether Inishmore is west of Clarence).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Inishmore is east
        of Clarence, Missouri (not west), indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Inishmore is
        east of Clarence, not west, and provides this as the reason for its negative
        answer.

        (Inishmore being east, not west, of Clarence), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        are equal or the same. In fact, it states "Barman is likely east of Zhytomyr"
        in its reasoning, indicating a difference in position, and then gives a "NO"
        answer. The model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
        There appears to be a contradiction between the reasoning (which suggests
        Barman is east) and the final answer (NO), but as instructed, I'm not resolving
        this contradiction.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Barman (in India/Asia)
        is east of Zhytomyr (in Ukraine/Europe)" and then says "NO". This indicates
        the model is rejecting some premise in the original question (which we don't
        see), but it's not rejecting it because the locations are equal - in fact,
        it explicitly states they are in different relative positions (east vs. west).

        County, Indiana (in the Midwestern US) is east of British Columbia (in Western
        Canada), which indicates a difference in position rather than equality. The
        model's reasoning implies that the NO answer is based on a directional difference.

        The model is identifying a directional difference, not equality between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its reasoning about the locations of Huntington County, Indiana

        for its NO answer, stating "Australia is east of Lebanon. Therefore, Gascoyne
        (in Australia) is east of Jezzine District (in Lebanon)." The model is saying
        NO because it believes Gascoyne is east (not west) of Jezzine, not because
        they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question of whether Gascoyne is west of Jezzine. This is

        for its NO answer, stating "Since Africa is east of Europe, Bargal (in Africa)
        is located east of Lika (in Europe)." The model is claiming that Bargal is
        east of Lika (not equal in longitude), which is why it's answering NO to what
        was likely a question about whether Bargal is west of Lika.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after concluding "Bargal is NOT west of Lika." This is an explicit NO answer

        EAST of Goring-by-Sea, indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Kohistan District is not west of Goring-by-Sea (but
        rather east of it).

        significantly east of Bulgaria" and "Mopidevi is east of Veliki Preslav, not
        west." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        difference between the locations. The model is saying NO because the locations
        have different positions relative to each other, not because they are equal
        or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        County is located), and that west of Robeson County would mean further inland
        in North America or across the Pacific. The model is implying that Masham

        stating that "India is significantly east of Russia" and therefore "Kondagaon
        cannot be west of Pechorsky District." The model is indicating a directional
        difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and direct, with no qualifications
        that would make it an UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Kondagaon district
        is EAST of Pechorsky District," indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer appears to be in response to the original
        question (which likely asked if Kondagaon is west of Pechorsky), not because
        the locations are at the same position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Kondagaon is east of Pechorsky District (since "India is significantly
        east of Russia"), which is the opposite of what was being asked. The model
        is not claiming the locations are at the same longitude or position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model determined that Kondagaon cannot be west of Pechorsky District because
        India is significantly east of Russia.

        answer is based on a directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

        is considerably east of Ethiopia. Therefore, Bogor is east of Agame." This
        indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the locations of Bogor and Agame. The model determined
        that Bogor is east of Agame (not west), and therefore answered "NO" to the
        question of whether Bogor is west of Agame.

        of Agame (in Ethiopia)." The NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.

        Agame." The model's reasoning indicates a difference in longitude, not equality,
        as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparison question. The
        model first reasoned that Indonesia is further east than Ethiopia, and Bogor
        is in Indonesia while Agame is in Ethiopia, concluding that Bogor is east
        of Agame, and then gave "NO" as its final answer.

        is east of Agame" and therefore cannot be west of it. The model is not claiming
        the locations are at the same longitude or equivalent positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Bogor is east of Agame,

        across the Atlantic Ocean" and concludes that "Froxfield is NOT west of Gladeview,
        Florida." The reason for the NO answer is that Froxfield is east of (not west
        of) Gladeview, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. It
        also states "Froxfield is NOT west of Gladeview, Florida" in its reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "England is east of Florida" which implies Froxfield is east (not
        west) of Gladeview. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Froxfield is not west of Gladeview, Florida. This is a clear

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Motobu, Okinawa
        is east of Basti district (based on Japan being east of India), but then contradicts
        this reasoning by answering "NO". The model does not claim the locations have
        equal values or are at the same longitude/latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its reasoning. This is a clear negative response to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Motobu is east of
        Basti, not west, which is why it answers NO. The reason for the NO is directional
        difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It provides a step-by-step reasoning process and concludes with an explicit

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines
        that the directional relationship is the opposite of what was asked - stating
        that Motobu is east of Basti, not west. The model is noting a difference in
        location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Motobu, Okinawa
        is not west of Basti district, but rather east of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Bulloch County is east, not
        west, of Litchfield" and that "Eastern Georgia is significantly east of northeastern
        California." The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after concluding that "Bulloch County is east, not west, of Litchfield." This

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Bulloch County is in the
        east while Litchfield is in the west, and therefore Bulloch County cannot
        be west of Litchfield. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Bulloch County, Georgia is not west of Litchfield,
        California. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Sibi District
        is east of Germasogeia (not west), indicating a directional difference rather
        than equality. The model is explicitly noting a difference in position (east
        vs. west), not stating that the locations have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "Sibi District is *east* of Germasogeia, not west" and then

    7f0dbc4f-cf07-4e47-822e-f850962fe8a6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined that the
        directional relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it concluded
        that Germasogeia is west of Sibi District, not that Sibi District is west
        of Germasogeia. The model identified a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the locations. It determines that Germasogeia (in Cyprus)
        is west of Sibi District (in Pakistan), not the other way around as the question
        asked.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. This is a direct NO response to
        whether Arba Minch is west of Inishvickillane.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d566bd3d-d6c9-4927-9a08-236a3af06efd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "Arba Minch, being in Ethiopia,
        is east of Inishvickillane, which is in Ireland." This indicates a difference
        in position (east vs. west), not equality. The NO answer appears to contradict
        the reasoning provided, but the model does not claim equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Arba Minch is east of Inishvickillane, not west. The model explicitly
        states "Africa is east of Ireland. Therefore, Arba Minch is east of Inishvickillane."
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It determines that Arba Minch is east of Inishvickillane (not west), and then
        explicitly answers "NO" to the question of whether Arba Minch is west of Inishvickillane.
      final_answer: 'NO'
