      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - rather, it gives a directional explanation that Florida is generally
        east of South Carolina as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is based on
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing reasoning about geographical positions
        leading to that conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it noted differences in their locations (one in southeastern
        US, one in northern US, with Florida being "generally east of Michigan").
        The NO answer appears to be based on these differences rather than any equality
        between values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out geographical facts about the locations.

        the same longitude. Instead, it explicitly states that Hackensack is "slightly
        east" of Point Pleasant Beach, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer appears to be because the premise of Hackensack being west is incorrect
        (it's actually east according to the response)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Rather, it made a directional comparison, stating
        one location was east of the other (though it contradicted itself on which
        was east). Since the NO was based on a directional difference rather than
        equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" as its final answer when
        comparing the locations. While there appears to be a contradiction in the
        reasoning (conclusion says Natalia is east while steps say Mi Ranchito is
        east), the model did provide an explicit NO answer as its comparative result.

        are equal. It explicitly stated different longitude values (-98.85 vs -98.17)
        and concluded NO because Natalia is east of Mi Ranchito Estate.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it determines NO based on New Egypt being south and
        east of Six Mile Run (i.e., a directional difference). The NO answer is based
        on a difference in position, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitudes. Instead, it explicitly indicates a difference in position,
        stating that western Ohio (where Botkins is) will be west of central Michigan
        (where Webberville is). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a different reason for the NO answer - that
        due to the relative positions of Ohio and Michigan, it's geometrically impossible
        for an Ohio city to be west of a Michigan city. The NO was based on this directional
        reasoning, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Daufuskie Island is east of Orangeburg (indicating a
        difference in location), not west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it laid out facts about
        their relative positions (coastal vs inland) and implied a difference in location
        (coastal areas being east of inland areas). The NO appears to be based on
        directional differences rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      result: 'NO'
    3901ba66-d4c2-40ea-8c0c-3c6a23e2b2cf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined Paramount-Long
        Meadow, MD is "almost certainly east of" Arkport, NY, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after reasoning
        about the relative positions of the locations. This was a clear comparative
        answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are at
        equal coordinates or positions. Instead, it explained that Paramount-Long
        Meadow is "almost certainly east" of Arkport, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after explaining
        why Paramount-Long Meadow, MD is not west of Arkport, NY. This is a clear
        comparative answer.

    5367f57c-6067-46ab-ae0c-073dc2521cda:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions, with Arkport being "likely further west" than Paramount-Long Meadow.
        The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    abdf1490-8345-4eb7-9e9f-1ad0d15db6e9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Paramount-Long Meadow is east of Arkport,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO is
        because one location is east rather than west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Paramount-Long Meadow, MD is east of Arkport, NY, not
        west. This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        or same longitude. Instead, it gives a directional explanation, stating that
        Western New York is east of Maryland, meaning there is a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response based
        on its geographical reasoning.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Paramount-Long Meadow is east
        of Arkport, indicating a difference in location. The NO appears to be rejecting
        that one is west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after explaining
        that Paramount-Long Meadow is east of Arkport, not west of it. This is a clear
        comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it actually concludes that Vail is NOT east of Winslow
        based on its analysis of their relative positions (though its reasoning appears
        flawed, we must evaluate only what was stated). The NO is based on a perceived
        difference in positions, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Santa Rita Ranch
        being southeast of Oak Trail Shores, not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model explicitly notes a directional difference (one is
        southeast of the other), so they are not equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative geographic
        positions (Washington being north of California), not because the locations
        have equal positions. It explicitly states one location cannot be west of
        the other due to their north-south relationship, not because they share the
        same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing geographic reasoning for why one location
        cannot be west of the other.

        due to the geographic relationship between California and Washington, a location
        in California cannot be west of a location in Washington. This is a logical/geometric
        reason, not an equality reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this NO is a clear response to the comparison being evaluated

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Penngrove is "slightly
        west" of Nisqually, indicating they are not at the same longitude. The NO
        answer is given because the primary difference is latitudinal (north-south)
        rather than longitudinal (east-west), not because the locations are at equal
        longitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a clear comparative result. While it notes complexity in
        the relationship, it gives a definitive NO rather than refusing to answer
        or indicating uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude. Instead, it explains that Sharptown is actually east of Sylvan
        Beach, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on Sharptown
        being east rather than west, not because the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining why Sharptown is not west of Sylvan Beach. The answer is
        a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly stated that "Collegeville is clearly west of Chesterbrook."
        The NO answer was given because there was a difference in position, not because
        the values were the same.

        noting that "Chesterbrook is slightly west and south of Collegeville." The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its analysis that Chesterbrook
        is west of Collegeville (not the other way around).

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Hopwood is "slightly east" of
        Oil City, indicating a difference in position (not equality). The NO answer
        appears to be because the premise was wrong (asking if Hopwood was west, when
        it's actually east), not because the locations have equal longitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Erma is east
        of Croydon (indicating a difference in position). The NO is because Erma is
        east, not because the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result to indicate that Erma,
        NJ is not west of Croydon, PA.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it concludes NO because it determines Butner is east
        of Bowman's Addition (indicating a difference in position). The model explicitly
        notes that "Butner is likely east of Bowman's Addition" as the reason for
        its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same in longitude. Instead, it explicitly states that "Western Maryland
        is further west than central North Carolina" and concludes that Butner, NC
        is not west of Bowmans Addition, MD. The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with no caveats about inability to determine or verify. The
        answer directly addresses the comparative question about whether one location
        is west of the other.

    ed36d580-025e-45b3-831a-11dcc4e52f23:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it determines that Butner, NC is east of Bowmans Addition,
        MD (indicating a difference in position), which is why it answers NO to whether
        Butner is west of Bowmans Addition.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes "Butner, NC is *not* west of Bowmans Addition, MD."

    f0a5aeea-ec98-417f-8d13-92a3a649ac06:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it determined that central North Carolina would be east of western
        Maryland, indicating a difference in position. The NO appears to be given
        because the premise (is A west of B) was found to be false due to A being
        east of B, not because the locations were at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after working through the locations step by step.

      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    29a9b519-3c6f-4e46-bea6-abec70558341:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because El Monte is northwest rather
        than strictly west of South Whittier. It explicitly notes a difference in
        position (northwest vs. west) rather than stating the locations are the same/equal.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, providing a clear comparative result based
        on the directional analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis determining that El Monte is west of South Whittier
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    5d2737f5-4ea1-4b35-9f57-3456d52f6226:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after explaining its reasoning process.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    7fb0de8e-ff6e-4300-9b77-948e63c1a7af:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that El Monte is "northwest"
        and "primarily north and only slightly west" of South Whittier, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO is based on El Monte not being "strictly
        west" rather than any equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        regarding whether El Monte is west of South Whittier. This is a clear comparative
        result, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b416a338-4cdb-4dd5-8701-303b87cb4539:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - instead, it noted that El Monte is "slightly northwest" of South
        Whittier. The NO answer was given because northwest position doesn't satisfy
        strictly westward position, not because the locations were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, and this was a clear directional comparison rather than
        a rejection of premises or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c46f9cb2-68f0-43b7-9fe8-9e1dc192523f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation only
        applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    d127339d-647d-4f7c-9527-2c5b58fc4dbb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was because El Monte
        is northwest (not strictly west) of South Whittier, indicating a directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that El Monte is northwest, not strictly west, of South Whittier.
        This is a clear comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e8bd540c-8e2c-4830-8365-e3c90b877f11:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (El Monte is "primarily
        north and slightly west" of South Whittier). The NO is because the direction
        is northwest rather than strictly west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that El Monte is northwest (not strictly west) of South Whittier.
        This is a clear comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
