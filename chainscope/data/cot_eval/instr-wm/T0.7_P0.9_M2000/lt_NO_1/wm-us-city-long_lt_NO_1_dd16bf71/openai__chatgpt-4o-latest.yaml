        farther west compared to Stilwell." The model is saying NO because the direction
        is opposite to what was asked (Stilwell is east of Poteau, not west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question about whether Stilwell is west of Poteau.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Stilwell is east
        of Poteau" (indicating a directional difference), and this difference is the
        reason for the NO answer. The model also previously noted that "Stilwell is
        generally north and slightly east of Poteau."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Since Stilwell is east of
        Poteau, the answer is **NO**." This is an explicit NO answer to the question
        of whether Stilwell is west of Poteau.

        The reason for the NO answer is that Cambridge City is east of Huntertown,
        not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "Cambridge City
        is not west of Huntertown" and then provides "NO" as its final answer.
