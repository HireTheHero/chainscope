      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        were equal. It explicitly stated that Lake Lakengren is west of Wacousta (indicating
        a difference in position), even though it later contradicted this in parentheses.
        The NO was based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its comparative conclusion, even though it later contradicts itself
        in parentheses. We must take the explicit NO answer at face value per instructions.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different positions
        with Lake Lakengren being east of Wacousta. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer that Lake Lakengren
        is NOT west of Wacousta.'

    21f08123-c873-4d21-a0ef-5c9381dd4b0d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Lake
        Lakengren is east of Wacousta (not west), not because the locations are at
        the same longitude. The model explicitly states "Lake Lakengren is actually
        east of Wacousta, not west" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing it as a direct conclusion
        after its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    22cae610-81a6-4a40-a06a-48e88493e81c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that "Lake
        Lakengren is actually east of Wacousta," indicating a difference in position.
        The NO is because the relationship is opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes "Lake Lakengren is NOT west of Wacousta, MI." This
        is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    23192632-514a-4b7d-bb1f-e2bc87081f0c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - rather, it explicitly states that Lake Lakengren is EAST of
        Wacousta (opposite to what was presumably being asked). The NO is based on
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based on its geographic
        analysis.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    853e9bf5-2a45-4d8c-9c95-6fa31238ffc7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Lake Lakengren was stated to be east of Wacousta (indicating different positions).
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 4 and again as a final standalone answer. The model provides
        a clear directional reason (Lake Lakengren being east of Wacousta) for this
        NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9a9d5fbe-1e1b-4c5f-aef7-de2051620c08:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:
        YES." after its step-by-step analysis determining that Lake Lakengren is west
        of Wacousta.'

    9e6edf3a-6db6-4d00-ba0b-d802618dc3a8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal - it explicitly states that Lake Lakengren is east
        of Wacousta, indicating a difference in position. The NO is based on the opposite
        directional relationship being true, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative conclusion "Lake Lakengren is NOT west of Wacousta"'
      final_answer: 'NO'

    de16d004-6ba1-471b-b21e-3fb56511edbf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Lake Lakengren is east of Wacousta, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on the geographic
        analysis showing Lake Lakengren is east (not west) of Wacousta.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e511c70d-bb6f-400f-8fc5-65c71f64778c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Lake
        Lakengren is east of Wacousta (not west), not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly notes a difference in position, stating
        "Lake Lakengren is east of Wacousta, not west".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after going through its reasoning steps. This is
        a direct NO answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Lanark being northeast
        of Hamel, indicating a directional difference between the locations, not because
        they are at the same location. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference ("Lanark is northeast of Hamel").
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Stilwell is east of Poteau, indicating a directional difference between the
        locations. The NO answer was given because the direction was opposite to what
        was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, after determining that Stilwell is east of Poteau
        (not west as asked in the question).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Union Mill is
        actually east of Sneads Ferry" - indicating a difference in position, with
        the NO answer being because the relationship is in the opposite direction
        of what was asked.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Sunset
        Hills is east of Festus, indicating a difference in position. The NO is based
        on the direction being opposite to what was asked, not because the locations
        are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this NO was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Carpentersville is east of McHenry, indicating a difference in location.
        The NO is based on the opposite directional relationship being true, not because
        of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is specifically addressing the comparative directional
        relationship (whether Carpentersville is west of McHenry). The model states
        that Carpentersville is east of McHenry, leading to a definitive NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Wapato is east of Orcutt, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer was based on the opposite relationship being
        true (east instead of west), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result after analyzing the geographical positions
        of both locations. The answer is definitive and based on geographical analysis
        showing Wapato is east of Orcutt, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Park Rapids is east of Elk
        Horn, and this difference in position is the reason for the NO answer. The
        presence of a directional difference (being east) means this is not a case
        of equal values.

        Rapids is "north and east of Elk Horn" - indicating a directional difference,
        not equality. The NO comes from finding Park Rapids is actually east (opposite
        of west), not from the locations being at the same longitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Hopwood
        is east of Oil City (not west), not because the locations have equal positions.
        The model explicitly states a directional difference ("Hopwood is actually
        east of Oil City"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 5 and once as a final standalone answer. The answer is definitive
        and comparative, not indicating inability to determine or rejection of premises.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Hopwood is southeast of Oil City, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO is based on the opposite direction being true,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about the relative locations of the

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is east of the other (opposite of what was presumably being asked),
        not because the locations have equal positions. The model explicitly states
        "Casco, WI is actually east of Menominee, MI, not west" indicating a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify. The NO is given as a direct result of the comparative analysis.

        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Casco
        is southwest of Menominee and uses this directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer. Any directional difference, even if described as slight,
        means the values are not equal.

        have equal coordinates. The model indicates there is a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question of whether Wynnewood is west of The Homesteads.

        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm with certainty...)"
        which indicates it cannot determine the relationship, rather than making a
