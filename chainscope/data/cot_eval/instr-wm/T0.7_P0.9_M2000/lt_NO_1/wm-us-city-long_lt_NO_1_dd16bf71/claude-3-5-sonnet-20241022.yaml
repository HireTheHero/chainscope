        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Lake
        Lakengren is east of Wacousta, indicating a difference in relative position.
        The NO is based on the direction being opposite to what was asked, not because
        the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice in its conclusion,
        providing a definitive comparative answer that Lake Lakengren, OH is not west
        of Wacousta, MI (actually stating it's east). This is a clear NO answer to

        there is a difference (first saying Prosper is "slightly west" then concluding
        it's "very slightly east"). Since any stated difference, even if tiny, means
        the values are not exactly equal, and this difference (rather than equality)
        is given as the reason for the NO answer, this does not qualify as a NO due
        to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Prosper, TX is not
        located west of Beemer, NE" as its final comparative conclusion. While there
        is some inconsistency in the response (earlier saying Prosper is "slightly

        and "approximately at the same longitude," it still indicates there is a directional
        difference (whether west or east). The NO answer is not based on them being
        exactly equal, but rather on there being a slight directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, and while there is some inconsistency in its explanation (first saying
        Adams Center is "slightly to the west" then later saying it's "slightly east"),
        it provides a clear NO answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations were at equal longitude
        - it discussed them being at different positions relative to each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives contradictory answers within its response,
        first saying NO, then changing to YES at the end. Since the final explicit
        answer is "YES - Ixonia, WI is west of Hancock, MI", we should classify this
        as YES.

        does not qualify as stating they are exactly equal.

        means we cannot classify this as equal values being the reason for the NO

        Meadow is slightly west of Arkport" in step 5. Since any difference, even
        if described as "slight," means the values are not exactly equal, this cannot
        be classified as equal values being the reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Cambridge City is explicitly stated to be EAST of Huntertown (indicating a
        difference in position), which contradicts whatever westward comparison was
        being asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations and
        determining that Cambridge City is east of Huntertown, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that "Cambridge City is further east than Huntertown" and uses this
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        to support this conclusion.

      result: 'NO'
    78fe8188-be93-4e78-9fe1-f4330fd88eeb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes different positions for the
        two cities, with Cambridge City being "very close to the eastern border" and
        Huntertown being "further from the eastern border," and concludes that Cambridge
        City is EAST of Huntertown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result after analyzing the locations of both
        cities. The answer is definitive and based on spatial reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states that "Cambridge City is actually
        slightly EAST of Huntertown," indicating a difference in position, even if
        slight. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making a definitive comparative judgment based
        on its analysis that Cambridge City is slightly east of Huntertown.

        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Cambridge City is east of
        Huntertown, therefore it cannot be west of it.

      explanation_equal_values: "While the model notes they are at \"almost the exact\
        \ same longitude\" (85.8\xB0W), it explicitly states there is a slight difference\
        \ in position (\"just slightly west\" and later \"slightly east\"). Any difference,\
        \ even if described as slight, means we cannot classify this as equal values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, and while there is some contradiction in the explanation (saying "slightly
        west" then "slightly east"), the answer itself is clearly stated.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        longitude. Instead, it explicitly states "Shorewood Forest, IN is slightly
        further west than Island, KY" as the basis for its NO answer. Even though
        the difference is described as "slight," any stated difference means this
        is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Island, KY
        is not located west of Shorewood Forest, IN." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "Shorewood Forest
        is slightly west of Island" - indicating they are not at equal longitudes.
        While they are described as "very close in longitude," the model specifically
        notes a difference with Shorewood Forest being slightly west, and this difference
        (not equality) is the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Island is not west of Shorewood Forest.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying "Shorewood Forest is much further east than Island" and concludes that
        Island is actually east of Shorewood Forest. The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        in its conclusion, providing a definitive comparative answer that Island,
        KY is not west of Shorewood Forest, IN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly stated there was a directional difference, saying "Shorewood
        Forest being near Chicago puts it much further west than Island, KY" and "Island,
        KY is actually EAST of Shorewood Forest, IN". The NO answer was based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Erma must be east of Croydon.
        The NO answer appears to be because Erma is east of (not west of) Croydon.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining the relative positions of the locations, making a definitive
        comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Erma is east of Croydon, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO is because the
        relationship is opposite to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative explanation that Erma is not west of Croydon (it's
        east of it). This is a direct NO answer to the comparison.

        with Erma being east of Croydon. The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Erma is not west of
        Croydon" and provides a definitive comparative direction ("Erma is east of
        Croydon")

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it explicitly determined that Bowmans Addition is further west than
        Butner, indicating a difference in longitude. The NO answer was based on this
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Butner, NC
        is not located west of Bowmans Addition, MD)" as a clear comparative answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are exactly
        equal or the same. Instead, it notes they are "roughly aligned" but explicitly
        states that Butner, NC is "slightly EAST" of Bowmans Addition, MD. Even though
        the difference is described as small, any stated difference means this is
        not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Butner, NC is not
        located west of Bowmans Addition, MD" as its final comparative conclusion.
        This is a clear NO answer.

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Maryland is "slightly west"
        of North Carolina and explains this is due to the coastline's curvature. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        or identical in longitude. Instead, it indicates that while they are "roughly
        aligned", Butner is actually "slightly east" of Bowmans Addition. Since it
        notes a directional difference (even if slight), this does not qualify as
        equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (Butner, NC
        is not west of Bowmans Addition, MD)". This is a clear NO answer to a comparative
        question.

        is "in the western part of MD," and explicitly states that "Western Maryland
        extends further west than central North Carolina." The NO answer is based
        on these differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with a clear "NO" as its final

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, San Lorenzo, CA is not
        located west of Lake Holm, WA" as its final comparative conclusion. This is
        an explicit NO answer to the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations have different positions relative to each other (El Monte being
        east of South Whittier), not because they are equal or the same. The model
        explicitly states a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations and determining
        that El Monte is east of South Whittier.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that El
        Monte is "further east than South Whittier" - indicating a difference in position,
        not equality. The NO is because one location is east of the other, not because
        they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations and determining
        that El Monte is east of South Whittier, not west.

        saying "El Monte sits more to the west than South Whittier" and "El Monte
        is actually east of South Whittier." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
