        difference in their positions. The model's reasoning is that Point Pleasant
        Beach is in the southern part of the state while Hackensack is in the northern
        part, and based on the general layout of New Jersey, Point Pleasant Beach
        is east of Hackensack.

        west of Sunset Hills due to its more southward location." The model is giving
        a NO answer because it believes the direction is reversed - Festus is west
        of Sunset Hills, not Sunset Hills west of Festus.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a specific directional difference,
        stating "South Whittier, CA, being more central, is relatively west of El
        Monte, CA" and "El Monte, CA is closer to the San Gabriel Mountains, which
        means it's more to the east in Los Angeles County." The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Based on this step-by-step
        analysis, the answer is: **NO**" at the end of its response. This is a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "El Monte is not located west
        of South Whittier" and further explains that "El Monte [is] being more to
        the east." This indicates a directional difference between the locations,
        not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that El Monte and South Whittier
        are at the same longitude or have equal east-west positions. Instead, it says
        they are "relatively close to each other" and "it's unlikely that one would
        be significantly west of the other." This suggests a difference exists, even
        if small, rather than equality. The model does not explicitly state they are
        exactly the same or equal in position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two locations have
        equal or identical coordinates or positions. Instead, it describes El Monte
        as being "in the eastern part of Los Angeles County" and South Whittier as
        being "in the central part of Los Angeles County, slightly east of the city
        of Los Angeles." The model is implying a difference in positions, not equality,
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether El Monte, CA is located west of South Whittier, CA. This is a clear
        comparative result.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that El Monte is not west of South
        Whittier, but rather "more to the northeast." This indicates a directional
        difference between the locations, not equality. The NO answer is based on
        this directional relationship, not on the locations being identical.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        $\boxed{NO}$" at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer
