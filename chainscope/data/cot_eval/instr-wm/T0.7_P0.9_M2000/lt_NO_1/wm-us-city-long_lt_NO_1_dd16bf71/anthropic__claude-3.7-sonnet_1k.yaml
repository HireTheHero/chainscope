      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lake Lakengren
        is east of Wacousta, not west" and that "Lake Lakengren in western Ohio would
        be southeast of Wacousta, Michigan." The model is indicating a directional
        difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Lake Lakengren, OH is not located west of Wacousta, MI. The
        model provides a direct and explicit negative answer to the comparative question.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on any equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, directly answering whether Lake Lakengren, OH is located west of
        Wacousta, MI. The model clearly concludes that "Lake Lakengren, OH is located
        EAST of Wacousta, MI, not west."

        In fact, it contradicts itself - first stating "Gas City is slightly west
        of Brownsboro Farm" in Step 5, but then concluding "It's actually slightly
        east of it" in the final answer. Regardless of this contradiction, the model
        is claiming there is a directional difference (either slightly west or slightly
        east), not equality. The NO answer is based on a claimed directional difference,
        not on the values being the same.

        "very close in longitude," it specifically states that "Dallesport is actually
        slightly EAST of Metolius (or approximately at the same longitude)." The primary
        reason for the NO answer is that Dallesport is slightly east (not west) of
        Metolius, not that they are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Dallesport, WA is
        not located west of Metolius, OR" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        response to the comparative question.

        In fact, the model concludes that "Georgia, even its northeastern portion,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Oil City is further
        west than Hopwood, indicating a difference in their positions. The model concludes
        that "Since Oil City is further west than Hopwood, Hopwood cannot be west
        of Oil City." This shows the NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        east (not west) of The Homesteads, not because they have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Wynnewood, OK located west of The Homesteads, TX?" The

        are exactly equal or identical. Instead, it says "Wynnewood would likely be
        slightly east of or approximately at the same longitude as The Homesteads."
        This indicates a possible difference in position (slightly east), not exact
        equality. Since the model suggests a potential directional difference rather
        than stating the locations are exactly the same, this does not qualify as
        equal values being the primary reason for the NO answer.

        of The Homesteads." This indicates a difference in values (east vs. west),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that "Butner is east of Bowmans Addition" which indicates a difference
        in positions, not equality. The model is asserting that the relationship is
        the opposite of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Butner, NC is west of Bowmans Addition, MD. The answer is clearly

        are the same. Instead, it explains that Butner, NC is likely east of Bowmans
        Addition, MD due to the curvature of the East Coast. The model indicates there
        is a directional difference between the two locations, with Maryland being
        "generally further west than eastern/central North Carolina." This is a clear
        statement of difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response to the question "Is Butner, NC located west of Bowmans Addition,
        MD?" The model clearly concludes that Butner, NC is not west of Bowmans Addition,
        MD, but rather is east of it.

        stating "South Whittier has a slightly larger longitude value than El Monte"
        and "South Whittier is positioned slightly west of El Monte." The model is
        giving NO as an answer because South Whittier is west of El Monte (not because
        they're in the same location).

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly described their
        different positions, stating "El Monte is positioned to the west of South
        Whittier on a map" before giving its NO answer. The model did not claim the
        locations have the same coordinates or positions as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This directly contradicts its earlier reasoning
        where it stated "Therefore, El Monte is positioned to the west of South Whittier
        on a map." The model has given an explicit NO as its comparative result.
