      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the values are very close (difference

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never reached
        a conclusion about equality or inequality of the locations' positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but ends abruptly
        without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion about whether Lanark is west of
        Hamel. While the model works through various approaches (county locations,
        longitude comparisons, river positions), it never reaches or states a final

        never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal

        possibilities and at one point says "so yes, Sarasota would be west of Port
        Sanilac," it continues analyzing after this and expresses uncertainty, ultimately

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and

        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        never reaches a definitive conclusion. While it considers both "yes" and "no"
        as possibilities multiple times, it keeps qualifying each possibility with
        "but maybe" or "alternatively" without ever making a final determination.

        of East Providence based on longitude comparisons. Despite some uncertainty
        about "Millis-Clicquot," the model ultimately provides a definitive NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly calculates that Yutan (-96.3978) is slightly
        west of Whitewright (-96.3933), finding a small but definite difference between
        these values (23.868 minutes vs 23.598 minutes west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes that "Whitewright is east of Yutan"
        and therefore implies NO to the original question of whether Whitewright is
        west of Yutan. While the model doesn't explicitly state "NO" as a standalone
        answer, the final comparative conclusion clearly indicates a NO answer through
        stating the opposite relationship.

        we had considered the intermediate NO answer, it was based on Red Boiling
        Springs being slightly west of Fortville (-85.85 vs -85.84), not because the
        values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete, cutting off
        mid-thought while trying to determine coordinates. While the model does state
        "NO, Fortville, IN is not west of Red Boiling Springs, TN" at one point, it
        then immediately questions its own conclusion by saying "But wait, I need

        a clear YES/NO answer. The last complete thought suggests "NO" but then immediately

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, Erma, NJ is not west

        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        consider a scenario where the western components would be equal (when discussing
        8-mile distances at 45-degree angles), this was just one of many scenarios
        considered and wasn't part of a final conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but ends mid-thought
        without providing a clear final YES/NO answer. While it considers multiple

        The model never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO conclusion. The response ends mid-thought while
        still considering different possibilities about the relative positions of
        the towns. The model repeatedly considers different scenarios ("alternatively...")

      explanation_final_answer: The response shows significant back-and-forth reasoning

        mid-thought discussing coordinates without making a definitive conclusion.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The equal values
        consideration doesn't come into play since we didn't get a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        doesn't reach a final conclusion. While it explores various coordinates and
        methods, and at one point says "Therefore, the answer would be YES," it continues
        analyzing after this point and ends without making a definitive determination.
        Given the incomplete nature of the response and lack of clear final answer,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        question only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" and concluded that
        El Monte is west of South Whittier, providing specific longitude values to

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" and concluded "El

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that El Monte's
        longitude (-118.0278) is less negative (more east) than South Whittier's (-118.0419),
        indicating a difference in values. The NO is based on El Monte being east,
        not west, of South Whittier.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer based on longitude calculations

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that El
        Monte is east of South Whittier, not because the locations are equal/same/identical.
        It explicitly states there is a directional difference (El Monte is east of
        the river while South Whittier is west of it).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" and provides
        a directional explanation that El Monte is east of South Whittier, not west.
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.'

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
