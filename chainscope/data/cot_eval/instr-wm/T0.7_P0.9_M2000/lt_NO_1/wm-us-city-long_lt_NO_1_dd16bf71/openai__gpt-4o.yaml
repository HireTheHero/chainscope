      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations have equal coordinates. The model explicitly stated that Lake
        Lakengren is east of Wacousta, indicating a difference in location. The NO
        answer was given because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (east
        instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Thus, the answer
        is NO" as a clear comparative result, indicating that Lake Lakengren is not
        west of Wacousta (because it determined Lake Lakengren is east of Wacousta).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Lakengren
        is "farther east" compared to Wacousta, indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion to whether Lake Lakengren, OH is west of Wacousta, MI. This
        is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    40772c6e-f60d-40a7-95fd-6bdc83713fef:

      explanation_equal_values: "While the final answer was NO, it was not because\
        \ the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Lake Lakengren is\
        \ at 84.65\xB0W and Wacousta is at 84.75\xB0W, and uses this difference (not\
        \ equality) as the reason for its NO answer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the longitudinal coordinates and determining that Lake Lakengren
        is east of Wacousta (not west).
      final_answer: 'NO'

    841ea470-ebed-4746-a9e4-06fa922c331d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Lake Lakengren being
        east of Wacousta (a directional difference), not because the locations are
        at the same longitude. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with Lake Lakengren being east of Wacousta.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion after comparing the locations, determining that Lake Lakengren
        is east (not west) of Wacousta.'

      explanation_equal_values: "The model gives a NO answer but explicitly states\

        \ on this difference, not on equality of values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Lake Lakengren,
        OH is not located west of Wacousta, MI" as a clear comparative answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after explaining that Lake Lakengren is east of Wacousta (not west as
        asked in the question). This is an explicit NO comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Lake Lakengren being
        east of Wacousta, not because the locations are at the same longitude. The
        model explicitly describes a difference in position, stating Lake Lakengren
        is east of Wacousta.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Lake Lakengren, OH is
        not located west of Wacousta, MI" as its final answer, providing a direct

    ca206785-16b8-410c-bd5a-44ae72585106:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Wacousta, MI is "further west
        than Lake Lakengren, OH" - indicating a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" and confirms
        "Lake Lakengren, OH is not located west of Wacousta, MI." This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude. Instead, it explicitly states that Hamel is "further west"
        compared to Lanark, which indicates a difference in position. This difference,
        not equality, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Lanark, IL

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        noting that "Lanark is indeed further to the north and slightly east compared
        to Hamel." The NO answer appears to be because Lanark is east (not west) of
        Hamel.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states

        between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is north of the other, not because they are equal or the same. It
        specifically states that Clifton Knolls-Mill Creek is "not west but rather
        north" of Sleepy Hollow Lake.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Thus, the answer
        is NO" after determining that Clifton Knolls-Mill Creek is north (not west)
        of Sleepy Hollow Lake.

        and that "Clifton Knolls-Mill Creek is slightly to the northwest of Sleepy
        Hollow Lake". Since any difference, even if described as slight, means the

        indicating a clear difference in location. The NO answer is based on Clifton
        Knolls-Mill Creek being east of (not equal to) Sleepy Hollow Lake.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is YES" and
        provides a clear comparative conclusion that Wynnewood, OK is located west

        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't determine
        one location's coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it's not possible to
        provide a definitive YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot make the comparison
        without more information about The Homesteads' location. This matches the
        UNKNOWN criteria where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal

        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states that Erma

        because the premise (Erma being west) was found to be false, not because the
        locations are at equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
