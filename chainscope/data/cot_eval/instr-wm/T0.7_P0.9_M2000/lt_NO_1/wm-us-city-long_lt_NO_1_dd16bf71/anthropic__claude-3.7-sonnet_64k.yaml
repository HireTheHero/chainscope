      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Lakengren is
        east of Wacousta, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", the
        question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values being
        compared are the same is not applicable. The criteria state that if the final
        answer was not NO, the answer should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "YES" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly answers the question
        of whether Lake Lakengren, OH is located west of Wacousta, MI with an explicit
