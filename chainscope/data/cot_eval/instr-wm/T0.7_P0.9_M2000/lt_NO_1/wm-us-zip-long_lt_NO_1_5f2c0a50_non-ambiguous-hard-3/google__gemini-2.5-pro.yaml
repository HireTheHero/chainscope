      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that the locations are
        different, with Montgomery, Alabama (36107) being located east of Arlington,
        Texas (76001). The model gives directional difference as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether zip code 36107, AL is located west of 76001, TX.

        different, with Portland being "much farther west" and 99324, WA being "located
        east of 97239, OR." The model is giving NO because the locations have different
        longitudes, not because they are the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Wyoming is located entirely
        to the west of Iowa, and therefore "any location in Iowa is east of any location
        in Wyoming." The model is indicating a difference in geographical positions,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that the locations are
        different, with Wyoming being west of Iowa. The model states "Geographically,
        the state of Wyoming is located to the west of the state of Iowa. Therefore,
        any location in Iowa is east of any location in Wyoming." This shows the model
        is noting a difference in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion, indicating that the statement "51250, IA is located west

        "Wyoming is located to the west of the state of Iowa" and "any location in
        Iowa (like Sioux Center) is east of any location in Wyoming (like Casper)."
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        between the two locations. The reason for the NO answer is that Arizona is
        east of California, not that they are at the same location or longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model clearly concludes that Florence, Arizona

        The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether zip code 29405 is west of zip code 30354. The model
        clearly concludes that "North Charleston, SC is east of Atlanta, GA" and therefore
        answers "NO" to the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        Concord, NH (03303) is located east of Nunica, MI (49337), indicating a directional
        difference rather than equality. The model specifically states "Michigan is
        located to the west of New Hampshire" which shows the locations have different
        longitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 03303 in New Hampshire does not lie west of 49337
