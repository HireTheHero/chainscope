      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Montgomery, AL (36107) is
        east of Arlington, TX (76001), and that "Texas is generally west of Alabama."
        The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer to the question is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question about whether zip code 36107 in Alabama is located west of zip code
        76001 in Texas.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that the locations have
        different longitudinal positions, with Montgomery, AL being "generally east
        of Arlington, TX." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final answer: NO." at
        the end of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the question

        Instead, it explicitly notes that the locations have different longitudes
        (Montgomery, AL at 86 degrees west and Arlington, TX at 97 degrees west) and
        concludes that 36107 is east of 76001, not west. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        (Portsmouth, VA) is east of 28607 (Boone, NC), which is why the answer is
        NO. The model is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west), not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are at
        the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it explains that Iowa
        is west of Illinois, and therefore locations in Illinois (including 60137)
        are generally east of locations in Iowa (including 50703). The NO answer is
        based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 60137, IL is not

        (70065, LA), indicating a difference in longitude values (approximately 95
        degrees west vs. 90 degrees west). The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 70065, LA is not

        answer is NO, 85132, AZ is not located west of 90021, CA." This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.

    8ce535c0-be46-4a15-a220-fe2d21d9b3df:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are at
        the same location or have equal values. Instead, it explains that 85132 (AZ)
        is east of 90021 (CA), noting that "Arizona is generally east of California"
        and "Florence, AZ is east of Los Angeles, CA." The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO, 85132, AZ is not located west of 90021, CA." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Arizona is east
        of California" and "Florence, AZ (85132) is east of Los Angeles, CA (90021)."
        The NO answer is based on the directional difference (east vs. west), not
        on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is **NO**. Florence, AZ (85132) is not located west of Los Angeles,
        CA (90021)." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Ohio is further west than
        New Jersey, and specifically states "Since Ohio is further west, the longitude
        of Lima, Ohio (45801) is greater than that of Cranford, New Jersey (07016)."
        The model is indicating a difference in values (one longitude is greater than
        the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "**Answer: NO**" at the
        end of its response, clearly indicating that ZIP code 07016 in New Jersey

        Instead, it explicitly notes that the longitude of Cranford, NJ (-74.3) is
        less than the longitude of Lima, OH (-84.1), and concludes that Cranford is
        located east of Lima. The NO answer is based on this difference in values,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative

        of Odessa, TX (79762)" and concludes that 70444, LA is not west of 79762,
        TX. The reason for the NO is that one location is east of the other, not that
        they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO. 70444, LA is not located west of 79762, TX." This is a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in the longitudinal coordinates
        (-79.3 for Steeles Tavern, VA vs -85.7 for Brooks, KY) and concludes that
        Steeles Tavern is east of Brooks, not west. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of values.

        is located east of 40109 (KY), which is the opposite of what was asked. The
        model gives a directional difference as the reason for the NO answer, not

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO, 24486, VA is not located west of 40109, KY." This is a clear NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are at
        the same location or have equal values. Instead, it explains that the NO answer
        is because Alabama is west of North Carolina, meaning the zip code in North
        Carolina cannot be west of the zip code in Alabama. This is a directional
        difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are equal
        or the same in location. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO
        answer, stating that "Alabama is located to the west of North Carolina" and
        therefore "any location within Alabama, including zip code 35954, would be
        west of most locations in North Carolina, including zip code 28457." The model
        is indicating a directional difference, not equality.

        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        question of whether zip code 06770, CT is located west of 46617, IN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are at
        the same location or have equal longitude values. Instead, it explains that
        Arkansas is located to the west of South Carolina, and therefore Cabot, AR
        (72023) is west of Lexington, SC (29072). The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO, 29072,
