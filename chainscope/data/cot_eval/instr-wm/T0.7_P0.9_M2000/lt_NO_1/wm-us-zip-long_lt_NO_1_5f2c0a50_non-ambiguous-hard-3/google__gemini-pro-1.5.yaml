      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional reasoning that Alabama
        is east of Texas, and therefore a zip code in Alabama cannot be west of a
        zip code in Texas. The NO answer is based on geographical positioning (east
        vs. west), not on equality of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Alabama is east of Texas"
        and "A location in Alabama will be east of a location in Texas." The model
        is giving NO as its answer because it believes the premise in the question
        is incorrect (though we don't see the original question, it appears to have
        asked if Alabama is west of Texas). The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes differences in the locations, stating
        that Virginia is "generally north and slightly east of North Carolina" and
        that Boone, NC is "in the Appalachian Mountains, considerably west of the
        coastal plain where Suffolk, VA is located." These are clear differences,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result after analyzing the locations of the
        two zip codes.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Boone, NC is significantly
        west of Norfolk, VA" and concludes that Norfolk, VA (23702) is not west of
        Boone, NC (28607). The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is a direct response to the comparative question. The model first analyzes
        the locations corresponding to the zip codes, determines their relative positions,
        and concludes with "NO" as a definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Iowa is east of Wyoming,
        and therefore 51250, IA is almost certainly east of 82609, WY. The NO answer
        appears to be rejecting some unstated premise in the original question (likely
        whether the Iowa zip code is west of the Wyoming zip code), but it's not because
        the locations are equal or the same.

        notes that "29067 is a larger number and in a state south of NC, it's highly
        likely to be west of 28512" and confirms this with "Little Mountain, SC is

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "New York is east of Ohio"
        which indicates a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer
        is based on this directional relationship (NY being east of OH, not west),
        not on equality of values.

        that "11419, NY is likely EAST, not west, of 47834, IN." The NO answer appears
        to be because the premise of the question was incorrect (it seems the question
        asked if one location was west of the other, and the model determined the
        opposite direction was true). The model is not claiming the longitudes are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Pennsylvania is
        east of Illinois" and "a zip code in PA is generally east of a zip code in
        IL." The model's reasoning indicates a directional difference (east vs. west),
        not equality. The "NO" answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning,

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that the longitudes are different
        (-94.7 vs -107.7) and concluded that 75604 is further east, not west. The
        NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the longitudes of the two zip codes. The model determined
        that 75604 is further east than 88048 (not further west), and provided a direct
        "NO" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that the longitudes are different
        (-94.7 for 75604 and -107.7 for 88048) and states that "-94.7 is *less than*
        -107.7" as the reason for its NO answer. The model concludes that 75604 is
        east of 88048, not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the original
        question (which appears to have asked if 75604 is west of 88048).

        further east than Cleveland, Ohio" and that "New York City is east of Cleveland,"
        indicating a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.

        answer is based on a directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        which is a direct answer to the comparative question. The model also states

        appears to be rejecting some unstated premise in the original question (likely
        whether one zip code is west of the other), but it's not because the locations
        have equal longitude values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 07070 (New Jersey) is on
        the East Coast while 60652 (Illinois) is in the Midwest, and since the East
        Coast is generally east of the Midwest, 07070 is not west of 60652. The NO
        answer is based on geographical positioning (one being east of the other),
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, after concluding that "07070, NJ is *not* located west of 60652,
        IL." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        Jersey (East Coast) while 60652 is in Illinois (Midwest), and notes that East
        Coast states are located east of Midwestern states. The model is indicating

        an East Coast state while 60652, IL is in a Midwestern state, and concludes
        that East Coast locations are generally east of Midwestern locations. The
        model is giving a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer,

        east of Texas (where 77012 is located), and therefore 32129 cannot be west
        of 77012. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality of

        (TX) and concludes that 32129, FL is east of 77012, TX. The NO answer appears
        to be in response to a question about whether one location is west of the
        other, not because the values are equal.

        for its NO answer, stating that "Florida is generally east of Texas" and "a
        location in Florida would be east of a location in Texas." The model is saying
        NO because the locations are in different directions (east vs. west), not
        because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 32129, FL west of 77012, TX?" The answer is clearly stated

        are equal or the same. In fact, it indicates the opposite by stating that
        "Georgia is on the East Coast, and Oklahoma is more central/western" and concludes
        that "a zip code in Georgia is very likely to be east of a zip code in Oklahoma."
        The "NO" answer appears to contradict the reasoning provided, but there's
        no indication that the model is saying NO because the values are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Oklahoma is west of Georgia,
        and since zip codes generally increase from east to west, the Georgia zip
        code (30534) is east of the Oklahoma zip code (73142), not west of it. The
        NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after concluding that "30534, GA is *not* west of 73142, OK." This is a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Virginia is east
        of Illinois" and that "20121, VA would be east of 62204, IL." The model is
        indicating a directional difference between the locations, not equality. The
        NO answer appears to be rejecting some unstated premise in the original question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. This is a clear negative response to the
        comparative question.

        for its NO answer, stating that "Virginia is east of Illinois" and "A location
        in Virginia cannot be west of a location in Illinois." The model is indicating
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Virginia (VA) is east of
        Illinois (IL)" and then gives a "NO" answer, suggesting that the NO is in
        response to a question asking if Virginia is west of Illinois (or if Illinois
        is east of Virginia). The model is noting a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "a location in Virginia
        should be EAST of a location in Illinois" in its reasoning, which indicates
        a difference in values (east vs. west). The "NO" answer appears to contradict
        the model's own reasoning, but it does not claim equality as the reason for
        the NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Massachusetts is east of
        Ohio, and locations in Massachusetts have lower longitude values than locations
        in Ohio. The model concludes that "a location in MA cannot be west of a location
        in OH" - indicating a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, the model's reasoning suggests
        the opposite - it states "Massachusetts is on the East Coast, and Ohio is
        in the Midwest" and "The East Coast is generally east of the Midwest" leading
        to the conclusion that "a location in Massachusetts is likely to be east of
        a location in Ohio." The model gives NO as its final answer, but this appears
        to contradict its own reasoning rather than being based on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it provides reasoning that indicates a directional
        difference, stating "Massachusetts is on the east coast, and Ohio is in the
        midwest" and concludes "a zip code in Massachusetts will be east of a zip
        code in Ohio." The model's reasoning actually contradicts its "NO" answer,
        but we are instructed to take the explicit NO at face value without resolving
        contradictions.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Massachusetts is further
        east than Ohio, indicating a difference in position (not equality). The reason
        for the NO answer is that Massachusetts cannot be west of Ohio because Massachusetts
        is on the East Coast while Ohio is in the Midwest.

        east of Ohio, and that 02790, MA will have a lower longitude than 44030, OH.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that 02790, MA is not west of 44030, OH. This is a direct answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that 07432, NJ would be east of 15139, PA (not west) based
        on the general geographic relationship between New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
        The model is rejecting the westward relationship, not claiming the locations
        are at the same longitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that New Hampshire is on the East Coast while Michigan is further
        west, meaning one would travel westward from NH to MI (implying NH is east
        of MI, not west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states "New Hampshire is east of Michigan"
        in its reasoning, which indicates a difference in position, not equality.
        The "NO" answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but it does
        not claim equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "New Hampshire is significantly
        east of Michigan" and concludes that "03303, NH is *not* west of 49337, MI."
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference (east vs. west), not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        which is a direct answer to the comparative question. The model concludes
        that "03303, NH is *not* west of 49337, MI" and then provides the final answer
        "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared (the locations of New Hampshire and Michigan) are equal or
        the same. In fact, it explicitly states in its reasoning that "New Hampshire
        is east of Michigan" and that "northeastern states are generally east of the
        north-central states." The model gives a NO answer without claiming the locations
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which directly contradicts its reasoning that "New Hampshire is east of Michigan."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that 03303 (NH) is east
        of 49337 (MI) because New Hampshire is geographically east of Michigan, even
        though both are in the Eastern Time Zone. The "NO" answer appears to be rejecting
        some unstated comparison, but it's not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        and concluding "A location in New Hampshire cannot be west of a location in
        Michigan." The model is noting a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that a location in New
        Hampshire is likely to be east of a location in Michigan (not equal), and
        then gives a NO answer. The model is not saying NO because the locations are
        at the same longitude.

        Hampshire would be EAST of a location in Michigan," indicating a directional
        difference between the two locations. The NO answer appears to contradict
        the reasoning provided, but the model does not claim equality as the reason

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, the model's reasoning actually
        contradicts its final answer - it states "Therefore, New Hampshire is east
        of Michigan" but then concludes with "NO". Since the model does not claim
        equality as the reason for its NO answer, and actually suggests a difference
        in position (east vs. west), this does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.

        WV. The NO answer appears to be in response to the original comparative question
        (likely asking if one location is west of the other), not because the values
