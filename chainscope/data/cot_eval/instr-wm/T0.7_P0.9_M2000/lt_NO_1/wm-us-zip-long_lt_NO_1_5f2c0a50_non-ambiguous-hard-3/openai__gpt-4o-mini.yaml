        difference as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 39367, MS is located west of 75150, TX. The model
        concludes that "39367, MS is east of 75150, TX" and therefore answers "NO"
        to the original question.

        east than Mesquite, TX (75150)" - indicating a difference in positions, not
        equality. The NO answer is based on the fact that one location is east of
        the other, not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" at the end of its response, indicating that 39367, MS is not located west

        Instead, it explains that Harrisonville, MO (64701) has a longitude of approximately
        -94.35 while Parker, CO (80130) has a longitude of approximately -104.85.
        The model concludes that since -94.35 is greater than -104.85, Harrisonville

        Instead, it explains that 24486 (Virginia) has a longitude of about -79.5
        while 40109 (Kentucky) has a longitude of about -86.1. The model concludes
        that since the longitude of 24486 is higher (less negative) than that of 40109,
        24486 is located east of 40109, not west. The NO answer is based on a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether ZIP code 24486 in Virginia is located west of ZIP code 40109 in
        Kentucky. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

        NY) is located on the east coast while 15690 (West Newton, PA) is located
        inland and further west. The model concludes that "Westhampton Beach is to
        the east of West Newton" which is why it answers NO to the question of whether
        11783 is west of 15690.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the

        can conclude that 11783, NY is not located west of 15690, PA." The model is

        Instead, it clearly indicates that the zip codes are in different locations
        with different longitudes (-79.95 for Charleston and -84.43 for Atlanta).
        The model concludes NO because Charleston is east of Atlanta, not because
        they are the same location.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold at the end of its response. The model determined that ZIP code 03303
        in New Hampshire is not located west of ZIP code 49337 in Michigan.

    d8f052d7-27ba-4c05-bcf8-d49341260cc9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Concord, NH (03303) is situated
        to the east of Rockford, MI (49337), indicating a difference in their geographical
        positions. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 03303, NH is located west of 49337, MI. The answer is explicitly
        stated in bold at the end of the response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "West Chester is
        east of Buckhannon" and therefore "19363, PA is not located west of 26330,
        WV." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (east vs. west), not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The final answer is **NO**"
        at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative comparative result.

        Instead, it specifically states that "West Chester (19363) is east of Fairmont
        (26330)" - indicating a directional difference between the locations as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
