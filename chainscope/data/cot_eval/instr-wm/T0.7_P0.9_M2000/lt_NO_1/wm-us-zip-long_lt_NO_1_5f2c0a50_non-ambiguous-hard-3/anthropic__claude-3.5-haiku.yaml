      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that 36107 (Montgomery, AL) is east of 76001
        (Aledo, TX), indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 36107 (Montgomery, Alabama)
        is NOT west of 76001 (Arlington, Texas) because Alabama is east of Texas.
        The model is noting a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 36107 is east of 76001, indicating
        a directional difference between the two locations. The reason for the NO
        answer is that 36107 is east (not west) of 76001, not because they are at
        the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 36107, AL located west of 76001, TX?" The model explains
        that 36107 (in Alabama) is east of 76001 (in Texas), and therefore concludes
        with a definitive "NO" answer.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that 36107 (Alabama) is east of 76001 (Texas), not west. The model explicitly
        states "36107 is east of 76001" as the reason for its NO answer, indicating
        a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Texas is west of
        Alabama, and therefore 76001 (in Texas) is west of 36107 (in Alabama). The
        NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 36107, AL located west of 76001, TX?" The model explicitly
        concludes that "36107 is NOT west of 76001" and provides "NO" as its final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the locations have different relative positions - specifically that 36107
        (Alabama) is east of 76001 (Texas), not west as the question asked. The model
        explicitly states "Since 36107 is east of 76001, the answer is NO."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a direct answer to the comparative question. The
        model determined that 36107, AL is east of 76001, TX (not west of it), and

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that 76008 is east of 85735, not west. The model explicitly states "76008
        is east of 85735, not west" as the reason for its NO answer, indicating a
        directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 76008, TX located west of 85735, AZ?" The model explains
        that 76008 is east of 85735, not west, and concludes with "NO" as the final

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 18240, PA located west of 61611, IL?" The model clearly
        concludes that since Pennsylvania is east of Illinois, 18240 is NOT west of
        61611.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Charleston (29405)
        is east of Atlanta (30354), indicating a directional difference between the
        locations. The reason for the NO answer is that one location is east of the
        other, not that they are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in its
        reasoning ("29405 is NOT west of 30354") and again as its final standalone
        answer ("NO"). The model is providing a definitive negative answer to the

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 19363 is in Pennsylvania
        which is east of West Virginia (where 26330 is located), and therefore 19363
        is east of 26330, not west. The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 19363 is NOT west of 26330
        because 19363 is in eastern Pennsylvania while 26330 is in West Virginia,
        and Pennsylvania is east of West Virginia. The model specifically states "In
        fact, 19363 is east of 26330," indicating a directional difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "19363 is located near West Chester, in eastern
        Pennsylvania" and "26330 is located in central West Virginia" and concludes
        that "Eastern Pennsylvania is east of central West Virginia." The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        its NO answer, stating that "Pennsylvania is located east of West Virginia"
        and therefore "19363 is NOT west of 26330." The model is claiming the locations
        are in different positions, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
