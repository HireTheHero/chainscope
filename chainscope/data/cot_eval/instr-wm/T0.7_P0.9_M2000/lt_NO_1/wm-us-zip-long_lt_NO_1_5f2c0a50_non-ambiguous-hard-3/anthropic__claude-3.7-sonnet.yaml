      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that 60137, IL is east of 50703, IA (not
        west), indicating a directional difference between the locations. The reason
        for the NO answer is that one location is east of the other, not that they
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. 60137, IL is not
        located west of 50703, IA." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with 35749, AL being east of 73505, OK. The reason for the NO answer
        is that the premise of the question (that AL is west of OK) is incorrect according
        to the model's reasoning about US geography.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 35749, AL located west of 73505, OK?" The model concludes
        that "35749, AL is NOT located west of 73505, OK. It is located east of it."

        being compared are the same. Instead, the model stated that 51250, IA is east
        of 82609, WY (not west of it). The model explicitly notes a difference in
        positions, saying "Iowa is located east of Wyoming" and "51250, IA (in Iowa)
        must be east of 82609, WY (in Wyoming)". The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 51250, IA is west of 82609, WY. The model explicitly

        "28512 is likely west of 29067," which would suggest a "YES" answer to whether
        28512, NC is west of 29067, SC. Despite this contradiction, I'm only evaluating
        what the model explicitly stated as its final answer, which is "NO".

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 28512 is likely east of
        29067, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The
        NO answer is based on the direction being opposite to what was asked (east
        rather than west), not because the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 28512 is not west of 29067. The model provides reasoning
        about zip code patterns and concludes that 28512 is likely east of 29067,
        not west of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 70444 is east of
        79762, not west of it. The model is indicating a directional difference between
        the locations, not equality. The reason for the NO answer is that one location
        is east of the other, not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "70444 in Louisiana
        cannot be west of 79762 in Texas. It must be east of it." and then gives a
        clear "NO" as the final answer.

        York is east of Indiana" and "11419 must be east of 47834" as the reason for
        its NO answer. It did not claim the locations have equal longitude or are
        at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. The model went through a step-by-step reasoning process and
        concluded that 11419 (in New York) is east of 47834 (in Indiana), not west
        of it, and therefore answered "NO" to the implied question of whether 11419

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "38834 is in MS, which is east of OK" and
        "74105 is in OK, which is west of MS." The model concludes that "38834 is
        NOT west of 74105" because of this directional difference, not because they
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether zip code 38834 in Mississippi is located west of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 38834, MS is EAST of 74105,
        OK, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The reason
        for the NO answer is that the locations have different positions, not that
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 38834, MS is not
        located west of 74105, OK" as its final answer. This is a clear negative response
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have
        different relative positions, with 38834 (MS) being east of 74105 (OK). The
        model's NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 38834, MS located west of 74105, OK?" The model clearly

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the locations have different positions, with 38834 being east of 74105,
        not west as the question asked. The model explicitly states "38834 is east
        of 74105 (not west)" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that 38834 (MS) is east
        of 74105 (OK), not west, and therefore answered "NO" to the question of whether
        38834 is located west of 74105.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Mississippi being east of Oklahoma. The NO answer is based
        on the directional difference between the locations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether zip code 38834 is west of zip code 74105. The model
        clearly concludes that since 38834 is in Mississippi and 74105 is in Oklahoma,
        and Mississippi is east of Oklahoma, the zip code in Mississippi must be east
        of the zip code in Oklahoma, not west.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 90035 (in California) is
        west of 85255 (in Arizona) because "California is located on the west coast"
        while "Arizona is located inland, east of California." The NO answer is based
        on geographical positioning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
