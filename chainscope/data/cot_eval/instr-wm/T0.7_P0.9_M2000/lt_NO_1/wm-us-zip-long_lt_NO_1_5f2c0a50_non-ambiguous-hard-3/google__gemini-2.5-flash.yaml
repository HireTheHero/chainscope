      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Alabama is east of Texas,
        and therefore a zip code in Alabama cannot be west of a zip code in Texas.
        The model is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the
        response after the reasoning steps.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 36107, AL is east
        of 76001, TX, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference (east vs. west), not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 36107, AL is west of 76001, TX. The model explains
        that 36107, AL is east of 76001, TX, and therefore cannot be west of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Alabama (36107)
        is east of Texas (76001), indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on any equality between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 36107, AL is west of 76001, TX. The model concludes
        that 36107, AL is east of 76001, TX, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 36107, AL is located
        east of 76001, TX (not west), which is why it answers NO. The model is indicating
        a directional difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 36107, AL located west of 76001, TX?" The answer is explicitly

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the locations have different east-west positions, with Montgomery, AL
        being east of Arlington, TX (not west as the question asked). The model explicitly
        states "Montgomery, AL is therefore east of Arlington, TX" and concludes that
        the statement that it is west is false. The model is not claiming the locations
        are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model determined that Montgomery,
        AL (36107) is east of Arlington, TX (76001), not west of it, and therefore
        answered "NO" to the question of whether 36107, AL is located west of 76001,
        TX.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Alabama (where 36107
        is) is geographically east of Texas (where 76001 is), indicating a directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 36107, AL is west of 76001, TX. The answer is explicitly stated

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Alabama zip code (36107)
        is east of the Texas zip code (76001), not west. The model's reasoning is
        based on geographical differences between the locations, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model clearly concludes that the Alabama zip
        code is not west of the Texas zip code.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that "36107 is much lower than 76001"
        and concludes that "36107, AL is east of 76001, TX." The NO answer is based
        on the directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is NO" and emphasizes "NO" in bold at the end of its response.
        The model has provided a definitive negative answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 36107, AL is located east
        of 76001, TX (not west), which is why the answer is NO. The model specifically
        states "36107, AL is located *east* of 76001, TX" and concludes that the statement
        about it being west is false.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is **NO**" at

        have different longitudes (-88.08 for Glendale Heights, IL vs -92.35 for Waterloo,
        IA) and concluded that 50703, IA is further west than 60137, IL. The NO answer
        was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 60137, IL located west of 50703, IA?" The model determined
        that 50703, IA is further west than 60137, IL, so 60137, IL is east of 50703,
        IA, not west of it.

        not state or imply that the locations are equal or the same in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model determined that 70065,
        LA (Kenner, Louisiana) is east of 77008, TX (Houston, Texas), and since the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "West Virginia (25701) is clearly
        to the east of Kansas (66217)" and concludes "Since 25701, WV is east of 66217,
        KS, the answer to the question 'Is it west of?' must be 'No.'" The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The final answer is $\boxed{No}$"
        at the end of its response. It provides a definitive NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that 25701, WV is east of 66217, KS (not west as the question asked). The
        model explicitly states "West Virginia is significantly to the east of Kansas"
        and "Huntington, WV (25701) is east of Overland Park, KS (66217)." This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The final answer is NO"
        at the end of its response. It determined that 25701, WV is east of 66217,

        (-82.44 for WV vs. -94.81 for KS) and concludes that 66217, KS is west of
        25701, WV because its longitude is more negative. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 25701, WV located west of 66217, KS?". The model explicitly
