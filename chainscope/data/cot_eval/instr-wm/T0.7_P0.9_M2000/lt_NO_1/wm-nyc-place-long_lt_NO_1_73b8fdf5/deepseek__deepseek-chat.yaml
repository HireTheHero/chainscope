      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that one location is east of the other, indicating
        a clear directional difference. The NO is because the relationship is opposite
        to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that one location is northeast of the other.
        The NO is because one location is northeast rather than west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, providing a direct
        comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model actually found a
        directional difference between the locations, noting that one is "slightly
        northwest" of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations and determining that Police Officer Edward Byrne

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal/same
        - instead, it specifically states there is a directional difference, describing
        the park as being "north and slightly west of the hotel". Even though there
        is a "west" component, the model's NO answer is based on the overall directional
        relationship being different from purely west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Police Officer Edward Byrne Park is not located
        west of Comfort Inn Hotel JFK Airport.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (northwest vs. west).
        The model indicates the locations are in different positions relative to each
        other, with one being northwest of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a clear comparative result based on the direction being

    c16a82c9-cfe2-4b1b-ab80-692030e812bd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, describing the park as "north and slightly west of the hotel."
        The NO answer was given because the park's position doesn't match the specific
        directional relationship being asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with no caveats about inability to determine or verify. The
        answer directly addresses the comparative question about relative location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that Beach Channel Park is "slightly to the west" of Mall Eighteen
        (though primarily south). The NO answer is given because the primary directional
        relationship is south rather than west, not because the locations are at the
        same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result about the westward relationship
        between the two locations. The answer is clear and definitive.

        presented as a case of equal east-west positions being the reason for the
        NO answer. Instead, the model explains that one location is south of the other,
        and there is "no east-west displacement." The presence of any displacement
        information (even if zero) means we should classify this as False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "they are essentially aligned
        along the same street" and there is "no significant east-west displacement
        between them." This indicates the locations are at the same east-west position,
        and this equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer. The model
        does note a north-south difference, but the east-west positions (which is
        what was being compared in the question) are described as being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        are equal/same - it explicitly states that PS 49 is east of Sedgwick Houses,
        indicating a clear directional difference between their locations. The NO
        is because the westward relationship asked about is reversed (it's east instead).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that PS 49 is east (not west) of Sedgwick Houses Building

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that the school is east of the post
        office, indicating a directional difference. The NO is because the relationship
        is opposite to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that the school is east of the post office, not west

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO is because one location
        is north of the other, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations
        are different, with one being in the northeastern part of Queens and the other
        in the southernmost part. The NO is based on the Medical Arts Building being
        north of (not west of) the East Rockaway Inlet.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it both in the conclusion and as a final bolded statement.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result (not being west of), not as
        an inability to determine.

        the locations are equal. Instead, it states NO because Brooklyn is south of
        the Bronx, not because the locations are at the same longitude. The model
        is making a directional distinction, not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        NO based on Brooklyn not being entirely west of the Bronx and the specific
        location of Bronx River Houses in the eastern part of the Bronx. The NO answer
        is based on relative positioning, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that IDA COURT PLAYGROUND is to the north of RICHMOND PARKWAY MALLS, indicating
        a different relative position rather than equality as the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result that IDA COURT PLAYGROUND
        is not located west of RICHMOND PARKWAY MALLS. The model specifically states
        it is north instead.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one location being east and the other being west of Richmond Avenue), not
        because the locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states a
        difference in positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit directional reasoning explaining that IDA COURT PLAYGROUND is
        east of Richmond Avenue while RICHMOND PARKWAY MALLS is west of it.

        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that PETER COOPER
        VILLAGE BUILDING is "further south and east" than CENTRAL PARK TOTS PLAYGROUND.
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        Castle Day Care was determined to be east of PS 16, which is a directional
        difference. The model explicitly states "Castle Day Care is east of PS 16,
        not west."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        or the same. Instead, it explains that both buildings are on the east side
        of Manhattan, with Kips Bay Towers being further north. The NO answer is based
        on their relative positions being different, not on them being in the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        that "Kips Bay Towers South Building is further east (closer to the East River)
        and north compared to Stuyvesant Town." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Kips Bay Towers South
        Building is not west of Stuyvesant Town" as its final answer. This is an explicit

        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that they are both
        on 1st Avenue but Kips Bay Towers is north of Stuyvesant Town. The model identifies
        a different spatial relationship (north/south) rather than stating the locations
        are at the same longitude.

        there is a directional difference, saying that Kirby Center is east of Hotel
        Utica, not west. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it both in the conclusion and as a final bolded statement.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating that the Kirby Center
        is east, not west, of Hotel Utica).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explained that
        it's impossible for Kirby to be west of any Brooklyn location due to their
        relative positions (Kirby being on eastern Manhattan, with Brooklyn being
        southeast of Manhattan). The NO was based on geographical impossibility, not
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion about the relative locations. The
        NO is explicitly stated and relates to the geographical comparison being made.

        they are exactly equal in position as the primary reason for its NO answer.
        The NO appears to be based more on uncertainty and assumptions rather than
        confirmed equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" as its final answer, though it
        includes a parenthetical qualification. Since it explicitly states "NO" as
        its comparative result (even with caveats), this should be classified as NO
        rather than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

        positions due to lack of data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is "based on the lack of specific location data" and earlier states "we
        cannot definitively answer." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison

        do so.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is UNKNOWN"
        because it cannot determine the relative positions without address data. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN criteria as the model indicates it cannot make the

        are likely in "the same building" or "share the same location" and this is
        the primary basis for its NO answer. The model does not indicate any directional
        difference between the locations, but rather explicitly states they would
        "not be east or west of each other but rather share the same location."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any qualifiers that would make it an UNKNOWN (like "cannot verify"
        or "cannot determine"). While the model expresses some uncertainty in its
        reasoning, it still provides a clear NO as its comparative conclusion.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies it's
        due to insufficient information to confirm the positions. This is equivalent

        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is due to inability to determine the relative positions due to lack of

        the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        that one location is east of the other (specifically, that Bais Esther School
        in Brooklyn is east of Holy Cross Church in Manhattan). Since the NO is based
        on a directional difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes "BAIS ESTHER SCHOOL is not west of HOLY CROSS CHURCH."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Great Kills Beach is east of Temple
        Emmanuel, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO is because the premise (Great Kills Beach being west) is incorrect,
        not because the locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Great Kills Beach is east
        of Temple Emmanuel, not west.

        NO is given because Great Kills Beach is southeast rather than west of Temple
        Emmanuel.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result based on
