    21e02408-a628-4d90-afc1-bfbadfb95cb3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are at different longitudes (-73.83 vs -73.88) with one being east
        and one being west of each other. The NO is not due to the values being equal,
        but rather due to finding a specific directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by directional reasoning that Holy Trinity is east
        of District 25 Pre-K Center, not west.

    229dc70f-ccaa-4cc7-8eda-5a7829505341:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states Holy Trinity is east of the Pre-K Center, indicating
        a directional difference (143rd Street is east of 138th Street). The NO answer
        is based on Holy Trinity being east rather than west, not based on the locations
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"NO \u2014 Holy Trinity\
        \ is east, not west\" as its final comparative answer. This is a clear NO\
        \ answer to whether Holy Trinity is west of the Pre-K Center."

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and reinforced
        this with an explanation stating that Holy Trinity Catholic Academy is west
        of the Pre-K Center, based on their relative locations in Queens.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    364a2afe-f833-4a1e-a6d2-d965e089764e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in longitude values (-73.8232 vs -73.8274) and concludes that Holy Trinity
        is east of the Pre-K Center, not west. The NO is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a specific comparative
        result based on longitude coordinates showing Holy Trinity is east (not west)
        of the Pre-K Center.

    6bce036b-925c-4357-b72d-438ef9c210c9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        - specifically that Holy Trinity is east (not west) of the Pre-K Center. The
        model never states the locations are at the same coordinates or equal distances,
        but rather explicitly states one is northeast of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a definitive comparative result based on its directional
        analysis that Holy Trinity is east, not west, of the Pre-K Center.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6c2a6e93-fcaf-46e1-bb13-4849696f9643:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        longitude values (-73.8083 vs -73.8303) and explicitly stated Holy Trinity
        is east of the Pre-K Center. The NO was not due to equal values, but rather
        due to finding that one location was east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a definitive comparative answer based on its analysis
        of the longitudes showing Holy Trinity is east of the Pre-K Center.'

    6c460ced-ba4e-407c-befd-7f736bedc3ed:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Holy Trinity is east of District
        25, indicating a clear directional difference. The model provides multiple
        pieces of evidence for this directional difference (street numbers, ZIP codes,
        neighborhood locations)
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" as its final
        conclusion, clearly indicating that Holy Trinity is not west of District 25
        (because it''s east)'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    93d2deb4-c15b-4497-8f10-334202fcf07a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        equal values is not relevant when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" after its analysis
        and confirmed this in the final paragraph, providing a clear comparative answer
        that Holy Trinity Catholic Academy is west of District 25 Pre-K Center.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    d335cebc-a515-4c34-9661-e3498ee267c9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the locations have\
        \ equal coordinates or positions. Instead, it explicitly notes differences\
        \ in longitude (Whitestone at ~-73.81\xB0W vs LIC at ~-73.95\xB0W) and concludes\
        \ NO because Holy Trinity is east of the Pre-K Center, not because they are\
        \ at the same location."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative conclusion that Holy Trinity

    3426fd57-9d75-48ed-aeb7-39cfc5ac75a5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        longitude values (-73.7778 vs -73.8036) and explicitly stating that the park
        is east of the hotel. The values are not equal, and the NO is based on this
        directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on longitude coordinates showing
        the park is east, not west, of the hotel.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4218dbc9-d42f-496f-aa85-012b8c293399:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        also did not conclude the locations were equal - it actually seemed to be
        working towards concluding they were at different locations (175th St vs 153rd
        St).
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        clear YES/NO answer. While the model seems to be working towards concluding
        that the park is east of the hotel (not west), it never actually states a
        final comparative conclusion.

      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    580083c5-0347-4142-bd74-84ed43ceaea1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        park is southeast of the hotel (a directional difference), not because the
        locations are equal. It specifically determines the park is at a higher street
        number (167th vs 127th) and lower avenue number (116th vs 135th) than the
        hotel.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative explanation for why the park is not west
        of the hotel (it's southeast of it)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7125d285-9df2-47cc-bbcb-f20e424a077f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        a specific difference in longitude values (-73.7931 vs -73.7742), explicitly
        stating the park is east of the hotel. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by detailed geographical analysis showing the park
        is east of the hotel based on longitude coordinates.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a490a1ea-9400-4040-ad82-a0fdd2765af1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that the park is east of the hotel (due to street numbering), which is why
        it's not west. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a directional explanation that the park is east, not west, of
        the hotel. This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e99d6f79-f10e-4faa-bc90-31142057c24a:

    f090fa95-9bb3-4fe7-b411-a4510a81eca2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        - it explicitly states that the park is east of the hotel (at 168th St vs
        153rd St). The model does not claim the locations are at the same position
        or equal in any way, but rather identifies a specific directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation confirming that the park is east
        (not west) of the hotel. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in location,
        with the park being east of the hotel (at 165th Street vs 127th Street). The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the main response and in the conclusion. This NO is
        given as a direct comparative result (the park is not west of the hotel).

      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive analysis but never
        provides a clear YES/NO answer about whether Beach Channel Park is west of
        Mall Eighteen. The response ends with uncertainty about the location of Mall
        Eighteen and various possibilities for relative positions. No definitive conclusion
        is reached.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate if equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive analysis but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers various possibilities
        about the locations and coordinates, it ends mid-thought without making a
        final comparative statement. The response shows uncertainty throughout and
        doesn't conclude with a definitive answer.

        (complex within park), it does not state they are equal/identical/the same.
        Rather, it describes a containment relationship where one encompasses the
        other, which is different from equality. The NO answer is based on this containment
        relationship, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides
        a clear comparative answer explaining that the park is not west of the complex
        because they are integrated, with the complex being within the park.

        "part of" the other. This is a different relationship than being equal/identical,
        so this doesn't qualify as equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided

      explanation_equal_values: While the model concluded they are "part of the same

        it argued that the park "encompasses" the house and is "central to the complex
        rather than situated west of it." This indicates a spatial relationship where
        they overlap or are integrated, not that they are at exactly the same location.
        The NO answer was based on this spatial relationship, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        a clear comparative statement that the park is not located west of the complex.
        The answer was definitive, even though the reasoning process showed uncertainty.

      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought and doesn't provide
        a final YES/NO conclusion. While it explores various possibilities and does
        calculations, it cuts off before making a definitive statement. The last comparison
        shows the Brooklyn school is further east but doesn't complete the logical
        conclusion.

    acfca691-8c0d-49f6-86a2-3633abcbb6a4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never reached
        a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values were the reason
        for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "YES, assuming the Brooklyn
        school is in western Brooklyn" but appears to be cut off mid-thought. While
        it seems to be leaning towards YES, it expresses significant uncertainty and
        conditions its answer on assumptions. The response ends without providing
        a definitive unconditional YES/NO answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    c04b4ac7-b7a7-46e4-bb4e-bb15543cf4d4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal - it explicitly states that Brooklyn is east of Manhattan,
        indicating a directional difference. The NO is based on Brooklyn being located
        east of Manhattan, not because the locations have the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive explanation that Brooklyn Charter School cannot
        be west of PS 527 because Brooklyn is east of Manhattan.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f7047bfb-221b-41d0-98ef-faa0624e245f:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.

        never reached a final NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate if equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought and never provides a
        final YES/NO answer. While it explores various scenarios where the answer
        could be YES or NO depending on the church's location, it ultimately concludes
        it needs "precise addresses" and doesn't make a definitive comparison.

        the model discusses various relative positions, it never reaches a final NO
        answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model works through various possibilities but
        ends with an incomplete thought. While it seems to be leaning towards NO (stating
        "So the answer would be NO" at one point), it then continues to express uncertainty
        and ends mid-sentence without providing a definitive final answer. The response
        shows uncertainty about the exact locations and keeps considering alternatives
        without reaching a clear conclusion.

        2, regardless of any comparisons made in the reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and cuts off
        before providing a final conclusion. While the model seems to be building
        towards a "YES" answer in its thinking (noting "Therefore, YES" at one point),
        the final formatted conclusion is cut off before stating a definitive answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. Instead, it explicitly states that
        PS 49 is east of Sedgwick Houses, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their locations (Willis Avenue being in the eastern part and Sedgwick
        Houses being in the western part of the Bronx).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by a detailed explanation of why PS 49 is east (not
        west) of Sedgwick Houses. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Willis Ave being "farther east" than Sedgwick Ave), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative explanation that PS 49 lies east (not west) of Sedgwick Houses
        Building 5.

      result: 'NO'
    479aa3f3-1c97-4cfd-8d12-ae0841e7d3cb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different - specifically that PS 49 is east of the Bronx River
        while Sedgwick Houses is west of it. The model does not state or suggest the
        locations are equal/same/identical; rather, it explicitly describes their
        different positions relative to the Bronx River.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a detailed explanation of why PS 49 Willis Ave is

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        - specifically that Willis Avenue is east of Sedgwick Avenue, making PS 49
        east of Sedgwick Houses Building 5. The model does not state the locations
        are equal/same/identical as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a directional explanation that PS 49 Willis Avenue lies east
        (not west) of Sedgwick Houses Building 5.

    60be39d9-f7b6-4cfc-af67-85f7e81ef076:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Willis Ave "lies significantly
        east of Sedgwick Ave" and describes them as being in different areas (Mott
        Haven vs University Heights). The NO answer is based on one location being
        east of the other, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both after its reasoning and in the final conclusion, indicating
        that PS 49 Willis Ave is not west of Sedgwick Houses Building 5.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that the locations are different - with PS 49 being east of Sedgwick Houses
        Building 5, with Willis Avenue being in the East Bronx and Sedgwick Avenue
        in the West Bronx.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final conclusion, indicating that PS 49 Willis Ave
        is not west of Sedgwick Houses Building 5. The model provides a specific directional
        explanation (that PS 49 is actually east of Sedgwick Houses).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (PS 49 being east while Sedgwick Houses is west), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        (-73.9100 vs -73.9156), it uses these to show that one location is explicitly
        west of the other, not that they are equal. The NO answer is based on finding
        that Sedgwick Houses is west of PS 49, not on the locations being at the same
        longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final conclusion, and provides a directional explanation
        that PS 49 is east of Sedgwick Houses, not west. The answer is definitive
        and comparative.

        the locations are equal/same - rather, it explicitly states that PS 49 is
        east of Sedgwick Houses, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO is based on PS 49 being in the opposite direction (east)
        from what was asked (west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a directional explanation that PS 49 is east, not
        west, of Sedgwick Houses. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Willis Avenue is east of
        Sedgwick Avenue, and PS 49 is east of Sedgwick Houses. The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference (east vs west), not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result that PS 49 Willis Ave
        is not west of Sedgwick Houses Building 5. The model is confident in this
        answer and provides specific geographical reasoning.

        the model discussed very small differences in coordinates, since there was
        no final NO answer, we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be truncated mid-sentence
        and doesn't actually provide a final YES/NO answer. While the thinking process
        suggests the model was leaning towards NO, it never explicitly states a final
        comparative conclusion. The last complete thought indicates Jamaica High School
        is east of Maritime College, but cuts off before making a definitive statement.

        between the two locations. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        schools are in different locations, with one being east and the other west
        of the Bronx River. The model explicitly states that Millennium is east of
        Bronx Mathematics Preparatory School, not that they are in the same location.

        notes the difference between these values and uses this difference to conclude
        that one location is east of the other. The NO answer is based on one location
        being east of the other, not on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly determined that the locations have different
        longitudes (-73.8964 vs -73.9271) and concluded that EMS is east of the church.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        different values (-73.9343 vs -73.9332) anyway, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought and never provides a
        clear YES/NO conclusion. While it was working through the coordinates and

        there is a directional difference - that EMS Division 3 HQ is "east of the
        church" and "Bergen Avenue in East New York is significantly farther east."
        The NO is based on the locations being different (one east of the other),
        not being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a definitive comparative result based on its geographical
        analysis. The model concludes that EMS Division 3 HQ is east (not west) of
        the church.

        instead, it explicitly states they are on opposite sides of Fifth Avenue,
        with the building being east and the playground being west. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: After a long analysis, the model concludes that "the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that the building is "east of the playground"
        because it's between 1st and 2nd Avenues while the playground is at 5th Avenue.
        The model identifies a clear directional difference between the locations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice - both after
        its thinking process and in its final summary. It clearly concludes that the
        building is east of the playground, not west, making this a definitive NO
        answer to the comparative question.

    859cbee3-f981-4883-affa-825ae9c4aa18:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        - it explicitly states the building is east of the playground, not that they
        are at the same location. The model describes the building as being "far east"
        of Central Park and "east of 5th Avenue" while the playground is "inside the
        park (west of 5th Ave)". This indicates a clear directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice and provides
        a clear comparative directional conclusion that the building is east of the
        playground, not west. The answer is definitive and comparative.

        we were to consider the NO leanings in the reasoning, these were based on
        relative positions (east vs west), not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly without providing a clear
        final YES/NO answer. While the model works through various scenarios and seems
        to be leaning towards NO in its reasoning, it never explicitly states a final
        conclusion. The response cuts off mid-thought while still considering possibilities
        about the playground's location.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that the building is EAST of the playground (indicating a difference in position),
        with one being east of Fifth Avenue and the other being west of Fifth Avenue.
        The NO answer was given because their relative positions are opposite to what
        was asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a definitive comparative result about the relative
        positions of the two locations. The answer is supported by detailed reasoning
        about Manhattan's geography and clearly indicates that one location is east
        of the other.

      result: 'NO'
    bd9f9a6b-9f46-4bcc-91be-c812f4f27900:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, with the
        building being "east of the playground" and the locations being "significantly
        farther" apart. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a definitive comparative directional assessment, explaining that
        the building is east of the playground, not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ede0d2c1-00dd-40c8-99bb-4bb5ecd0afa5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the building is east of the
        playground (indicating different positions). The NO is based on the building
        being east of the playground, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "So is the building
        located west of the playground? No. Because the building is east of the playground.
        So the answer is NO." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f5ad6f0b-ea51-4680-94fc-f485adfa446e:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        The model never reached a conclusion about equality or inequality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought
        without reaching a final YES/NO conclusion. While the model does extensive
        analysis of the locations and Manhattan's street system, it never actually
        states a comparative conclusion about whether one location is west of the
        other.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, even in the temporary
        NO statement that was later questioned, the model was comparing different
        locations (not equal values).
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but ends mid-thought
        without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it explores various aspects
        of Manhattan geography and seems to lean towards NO at one point ("Therefore,
        the answer would be NO"), it immediately questions this conclusion ("Wait,
        but is that correct?") and ends without resolving the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that Castle Day Care
        is not west of PS 16 because it is east of it.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        even in the portions where the model considers NO as an answer, it's based
        on relative positions (one being east of the other), not because they're at
        the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (ends with "But
        I'm getting") and never provides a clear final YES/NO answer. While the model
        discusses various possibilities and seems to lean towards NO several times,
        it continues to second-guess itself with "alternatively" scenarios and never
        commits to a final answer.

    2af2a0e0-fade-4da1-9d5f-fff5b912e9fe:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: Throughout the analysis, the model concludes that
        both locations are on the eastern edge of Manhattan and therefore have the
        same east-west position ("If they are both along the same eastern edge, their
        west-east coordinates are the same" and "in terms of east-west, they are aligned").
        The NO answer is primarily based on this equality of their east-west positions,
        with the model explicitly stating multiple times that "neither is west of
        the other" because they are at "the same eastern edge."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly ends with "NO" after its lengthy
        analysis. While the response was cut off at the end, the final comparative
        answer of "NO" was explicitly stated.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        The model never actually gave a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought and never provides
        a clear YES/NO answer about whether one location is west of the other. The
        response shows extensive reasoning about possible locations but remains uncertain
        about whether Pier 69-E is on the east or west side of Manhattan, and never
        reaches a definitive conclusion.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we had considered the incomplete "NO" reasoning, it was based on both locations
        being on the same side, not on being exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        explicitly states a final YES/NO answer. While it seems to be heading towards
        NO near the end ("So neither is west of the other. Therefore, the answer would
        be NO"), it then continues with "But wait..." and ends without making a definitive
        conclusion.

    a5f39c64-5889-40c9-93fa-129e9149dac3:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses both locations being on
        the eastern edge of Manhattan, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in their east-west positioning, with the pier extending further east into
        the river than the marina which is on FDR Drive. The NO answer is based on
        this difference in position, not on them being at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative directional conclusion that Pier 69-E is
        east of Skyport Marina, not west of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c42be961-aff1-4843-b79d-d52608864247:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes both locations are on the
        east side, it states they "share the same eastern longitude along the river"
        and that Pier 69-E is "at the same longitude as the marina, or perhaps slightly
        east." This equality of longitude is presented as the primary reason for the
        NO answer, without mentioning any definitive difference in east-west positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a detailed explanation. The NO is given as a direct
        comparative answer about whether one location is west of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    d525c44e-6c12-4c52-9df2-8e1ed8dc1c24:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        - that Pier 69-E is east of the marina (with FDR Drive between them). The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a detailed explanation supporting this comparative conclusion,
        stating that Pier 69-E is east of the marina, not west of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both locations are "on the same
        eastern side" and "share the same easternmost edge" as the reason for its
        NO answer. This indicates they are at the same east-west position, and this
        equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative explanation for why one location is not west
        of the other.

      result: UNKNOWN
    f5290df5-0dca-4c97-bd16-d98813f884d3:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this must be classified as False according to the criteria. The equal values
        consideration only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be truncated and does not
        reach a final YES/NO conclusion. The model spends the entire response analyzing
        different possibilities about the locations but never makes a definitive comparative
        statement about whether one location is west of the other. Without a clear
        YES/NO answer, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the response was exploring relative positions but never reached a conclusion
        about equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        doesn't reach a final YES/NO conclusion. While it explores various possibilities
        and seems to be heading towards determining that Skyport Marina is west of
        the pier (rather than Pier 69-E being west of Skyport Marina), it never explicitly
        states a final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Pumpkin Patch Marsh is east
        of Cedar Grove Cemetery, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative directional conclusion that Pumpkin Patch
        Marsh is east of Cedar Grove Cemetery, not west.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never reached
        a definitive NO conclusion where equality could have been the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and cuts off
        into unrelated text about historians and archives. While the model does extensive
        analysis comparing locations and coordinates, it never reaches a clear YES/NO
        conclusion. The last relevant content shows the model was still analyzing
        whether Pumpkin Patch Marsh is actually in Broad Channel, indicating uncertainty
        about making the final comparison.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Pumpkin Patch Marsh is northeast of Cedar Grove Cemetery, indicating a clear
        directional difference between the locations. The NO is based on Pumpkin Patch
        Marsh being east (opposite of west) of the cemetery.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a directional explanation for why one location
        is not west of the other (stating that Pumpkin Patch Marsh is east and north
        of Cedar Grove).

        \ difference (east rather than west), not on the values being equal."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific longitude coordinates and explaining that
        UPACA is east, not west, of Bushman Steps. This is a direct comparative answer
        to the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that UPACA is "significantly
        east of Madison Avenue" and is in the "eastern Manhattan" while Bushman Steps
        is in the "western part of East Harlem". The NO is because UPACA is east,
        not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative explanation that UPACA is east of Bushman
        Steps, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically states that UPACA is east of Bushman
        Steps (indicating different locations), and this directional difference is
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response after providing detailed reasoning.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that UPACA is
        on the east side of Manhattan while Bushman Steps are on the west side, indicating
        a clear difference in their positions. The NO is because UPACA is east of
        (not equal to) Bushman Steps.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the standalone "NO" after the thinking section and in
        the explanation that follows, where it definitively concludes that "UPACA
        Senior Center is not west of Bushman Steps."

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions - specifically that UPACA is on the east
        side while Bushman Steps is on the west side. The model never states or implies
        the locations are at the same position; rather, it explicitly describes them
        as being in different locations with UPACA being east of Bushman Steps.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer based on its analysis

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO conclusion. The response ends mid-thought about
        1st Avenue running north-south, without making a final comparative determination
        about whether UPACA Senior Center is west of Bushman Steps.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different
        locations, with UPACA being "significantly southeast" of Bushman Steps. The
        NO is because UPACA is east (not west) of Bushman Steps.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a detailed explanation of why UPACA Senior Center
        is not west of Bushman Steps (it's actually southeast of them).

        results in False according to the criteria. The equality comparison is not
        relevant since NO was not the final answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation supporting this answer, stating that UPACA
        Senior Center is west of Bushman Steps.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        UPACA is east of the Bushman Steps while Bushman Steps are west of Fifth Avenue,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that UPACA Senior Center is east
        of (not west of) the Bushman Steps.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing the exact values or stating they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-sentence
        without providing a final YES/NO conclusion. While the model gathered information

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that the locations are different, with one being east of the Harlem River
        and the other being west of it. The NO is because the relationship is opposite
        to what was asked (east rather than west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, providing a definitive comparative answer that Brilla Charter School
        Pax is not west of Marble Hill Houses Building 5. The model explains its reasoning
        based on geographical locations relative to the Harlem River.

      explanation_final_answer: While the response contains extensive analysis and
        reasoning, it does not actually provide an explicit YES/NO answer. The closest
        it comes is stating "Hence, the answer would be NO" but then immediately questions
        this conclusion with "But wait, maybe there's a Pratt Playground in a different

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        longitude or are at the same position. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Arch Street Yard would be "east of St. Nicholas Houses, not west" and that
        "Queens is geographically east of Manhattan." The NO answer is based on a
        directional difference (east vs west), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical positions of both locations. The answer is
        definitive and comparative, not indicating inability to determine or equality.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        coordinates or positions. Instead, it explicitly states that one location
        is east of the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is
        based on Queens being east of Manhattan, not on the locations being at the
        same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result stating that Arch
        Street Yard is not west of St. Nicholas Houses.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations have equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly states that Arch
        Street Yard is east of St. Nicholas Houses, indicating a difference in location.
        The NO is based on the fact that one location is east of the other, not that
        they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a directional comparison showing that Arch Street
        Yard is east (not west) of St. Nicholas Houses.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or equal position. Instead, it explicitly notes that Queens
        has a different longitude (-73.94) than Manhattan's west side (-74.00) and
        states that Queens locations would be "more east (a higher number, less negative)"
        than Manhattan locations. The NO answer is based on Queens being east of Manhattan,
        not on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional reasoning that Arch Street Yard cannot be west of
        St. Nicholas Houses Building 13 because Queens is east of Manhattan.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Kingsboro CC is "significantly
        farther east" than Macon Library, indicating a clear difference in position.
        The NO is because the relationship is in the opposite direction of what was
        asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning about the relative positions

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Kingsboro
        CC is east of Macon Library, not because the locations are equal. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference (one is southeast of the
        other), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a directional explanation
        for why one location is east (not west) of the other.

      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never arrives
        at a clear final answer. While it states "NO" several times, these are part
        of conditional statements ("if the hotel is at X, then NO") and the model
        keeps considering alternatives without settling on a conclusion. The response

        while the other is west of Essex Street, and concludes that Seward Park Ext
        Houses Bldg 2 lies "east of the hotel". The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        does not provide a clear YES/NO answer. It repeatedly states "the answer depends
        on where exactly each is located" and ends with a hypothetical scenario without
        making a final determination. While it explores various possibilities and

        final YES/NO answer. While the model explores various possibilities (saying
        both YES and NO depending on hypothetical locations), it never reaches a definitive
        conclusion. The last complete thought suggests uncertainty ("But without exact
        addresses, it's hard").

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate if equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is a long analysis that explores various
        possibilities and coordinates but never arrives at a clear YES/NO conclusion.
        The model keeps considering different scenarios and locations without making
        a final determination. The response ends mid-thought while discussing western
        Bronx coordinates.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation of why Luria Academy is east (not
        west) of the pavilion. The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Luria Academy is east of the
        pavilion, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative explanation that Luria Academy is east of

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that Luria Academy is
        east of the park while the pavilion is within the park. The NO is based on
        a directional difference (east vs. in park), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative directional explanation, stating that Luria
        Academy is east of the park/pavilion, not west.

        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        question only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear final statement confirming that "the academy is indeed west of the
        pavilion." Despite earlier uncertainty and considering multiple scenarios,
        it ultimately gave a definitive YES answer.

        - that Luria Academy is east of the pavilion. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, concluding that Luria Academy is east
        (not west) of the pavilion. The answer is a direct comparative result.

        Academy is east of the pavilion, not because the locations are equal/identical.
        It explicitly states there is a directional difference, with the academy being
        east and the pavilion being west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive thinking but never reaches
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps circling around the relative positions,
        repeatedly second-guessing its understanding of Manhattan's avenue numbering
        system, and ends mid-thought without making a definitive comparative statement.

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-sentence
        without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion. While the model works through
        detailed reasoning about the relative positions of the buildings and seems
        to be heading toward saying Kips Bay Towers would be west of Stuyvesant Town,
        it never actually states a final comparative answer.

        criterion only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response was cut off, but in the detailed
        thinking process, it clearly concluded "Therefore, the answer would be YES,
        Kips Bay Towers South Building is west of those Stuyvesant Town addresses."
        This represents a definitive YES answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought
        without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion about whether Kips Bay Towers
        South Building is west of the Stuyvesant Town addresses. While the model attempts

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this must be classified as False according to the criteria. The equal values
        consideration is not relevant since we didn't get a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-sentence without providing
        an explicit YES/NO conclusion. While the final paragraph seems to be building
        towards a "yes" answer (saying "therefore, yes, Kips Bay Towers would be west
        of Stuyvesant"), it cuts off before actually stating the final answer. Without
        an explicit final answer, this must be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        even in the partial NO reasoning shown, it wasn't because the locations were
        equal - the model was suggesting Kips Bay Towers would be east of Stuyvesant
        Town.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and cuts off
        mid-sentence. While the model works through various aspects of Manhattan geography
        and seems to be leaning towards "NO" at one point ("Wait, that would mean
        the answer is NO, because Kips Bay Towers would be east, not west"), it never
        actually provides a clear final answer before cutting off.

        consulate is northeast of 14th Street/Canarsie Tube, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a detailed explanation about the consulate being northeast
        (not west) of 14th Street/Canarsie Tube. This is a direct comparative answer,
        not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically states that the consulate is east of
        14th Street and provides directional differences (being in the Upper East
        Side, east of Fifth Avenue). The NO answer is based on the consulate being
        east rather than west, not on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        and clearly states that the consulate is east of 14th Street, not west. This

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that the consulate is east of
        the reference point, providing directional difference as the reason for the
        NO answer. The fact that one location is east of the other, even if by a small
        amount, means they are not at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer about the relative location

        based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times,
        including as its final answer, concluding that the Pakistan Consulate is west
        of the 14th Street/Canarsie Tube location because it is near 5th Avenue which
        is west of 1st Avenue where the tube is located.

        and "farther east" than the housing complex. The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (one being east of the other), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that the overpass is east of

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Queensbridge is east of Manhattan locations, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the two points. The NO is based on the impossibility of
        a Queens location being west of a Manhattan location, not because they are
        at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative reasoning about the relative positions of
        the two locations, explaining that Queensbridge (in Queens) cannot be west
        of PS 38 (in Manhattan) because Queens is east of Manhattan.

        difference in longitude values (-73.9420 vs -73.9422), explicitly stating
        that PS 38 is "slightly further west than Queensbridge." The NO answer was
        based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response was cut off mid-sentence at the
        end, but in the detailed thinking process, it clearly concluded "NO" twice
        in the final paragraphs, stating "Therefore, Queensbridge North Houses Building
        13 is east of PS 38, so the answer is NO" and reconfirming "So the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific longitude values (-73.9615
        vs -73.9937), it explicitly states there is a difference between them and
        uses this difference to conclude that JHS 227 is east of FIT. The NO answer
        is based on one location being east of the other, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that JHS 227 is east of FIT, not west of it, based on
        their respective longitudes.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the conclusion of its thinking and in the formal answer
        section. This NO is a direct comparative result indicating that Independence
        Towers is not west of the Central Park Precinct (rather, it's east).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that Brooklyn
        lies east of Manhattan and therefore the Brooklyn location cannot be west
        of the Manhattan location. The model is describing a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a definitive comparative directional assessment based
        on the geographic locations of the two places. The answer is supported by
        reasoning about Manhattan being west of Brooklyn.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        - that the Brooklyn building is east of the Manhattan precinct. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative explanation, stating that the Brooklyn building
        is east of the Manhattan precinct, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        Independence Towers is east of the precinct, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The model even discusses specific longitude
        values (-73.97 vs -73.95) to show they are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is specifically addressing the comparative directional
        relationship (whether one location is west of the other). The model is confident
        in this answer and provides it both in the conclusion of its thinking and
        in its final formatted response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that one location is east of the
        other (with the East River between them). The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a directional

    b6f80c9c-931d-4182-821d-382ffafd063e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states they have different longitudes (-74.0002
        vs -73.996) and explains that the Brooklyn location is east of the Manhattan
        location. The NO is because the premise (is A west of B) is false, not because
        the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result that Amico Senior Center
        is not west of Catherine St Shelter (rather, it's east).

        never reached a definitive NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO conclusion. The response ends mid-sentence while
        still considering different possibilities ("maybe the garage is on the west").
        Throughout the response, the model repeatedly considers different scenarios

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer because it determined
        the Guard Shack is east of the Garage (a directional difference), not because
        the locations are equal/identical. It explicitly states there is a directional
        difference with the Guard Shack being "east" and the Garage being "further
        inland (west)".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this question
        automatically receives a False classification per the instructions. The equal
        values scenario doesn't apply here since there wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear final statement supporting that the guard shack is west of the garage,
        based on its reasoning about the fort's layout and typical entrance positioning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that they are in different positions,
        with the guard shack being on the eastern side and the garage being further
        west. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a comparative directional explanation, stating that the guard
        shack is east of the garage, not west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in location (shelter at 7th/8th Ave vs school at 10th/11th Ave), not because
        the locations are equal. The model explicitly states that one location is
        east of the other, indicating different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly explains
        that the shelter is east of the school, not west of it. This is a direct comparative
        answer to the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (The Andrews being east of Facing History School), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states that 2nd Avenue is east of 5th Avenue,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that The Andrews Homeless
        Shelter is east of (not west of) Facing History School.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different locations,
        with the shelter being on the east side and the school being on the west side.
        The NO is because the shelter is east of the school, not west of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on its analysis of the locations.
        The NO answer is given as a definitive comparative result, not as an inability
        to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    442ce94a-c75d-4373-8677-2dd200a914ab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that the shelter is
        east of the school, with the shelter being "closer to 9th/10th Avenues" while
        the school is "near 10th/11th Avenues". The model identified a clear directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly concludes
        that "the shelter is not west of the school." This is a direct comparative
        answer without any caveats about inability to determine or equal positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-sentence and
        never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion. While the model works through detailed
        reasoning about the locations, it does not provide an explicit comparative
        answer to whether one location is west of the other.

    56bb951f-d9d5-478d-9e63-e2f19639117a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that the locations
        are different, with the shelter being on the east side (3rd Avenue) and the
        school being on the west side (between 7th and 8th Avenues). The NO is because
        their relative positions are opposite to what was asked (shelter is east of
        school, not west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final conclusion, indicating that the shelter is not
        west of the school. The model provides a definitive comparative answer based
        on the relative locations using Manhattan's grid system.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        The model never made a NO comparison based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a final YES/NO conclusion. The model gets lost in detailed analysis of Manhattan's
        street system and address calculations without making a final comparative
        statement about whether one location is west of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal or
        the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are on different sides of 5th
        Avenue, with one being on the east side and one on the west side. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a specific comparative explanation about the east-west positioning
        of the two locations relative to 5th Avenue.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in location - the shelter is on the east side of Manhattan while the school
        is on the west side. The NO indicates the shelter is east of the school, not
        west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation of why the shelter is east of the
        school, not west. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that one location is east
        while the other is west, with the shelter being east of Fifth Avenue and the
        school being west of Fifth Avenue. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that the shelter is east of the school, not west. This
        is a direct comparative answer to the question asked.

        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times,
        both after its thinking process and in its final formatted answer. The model

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        it explicitly states that Alpine is east of Bravo, indicating a clear directional
        difference. The NO answer is based on Alpine being east of Bravo, not because
        the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a definitive comparative conclusion that Alpine is east of Bravo, not

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equality or inequality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive thinking about locations
        and street layouts but never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion about whether
        Alpine Cinemas is west of Bravo. The response ends mid-thought while still
        trying to determine the relative positions.

    d0c17e80-9892-4a08-9eed-604b5fb7867c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the locations are equal/same - rather, it explicitly states that Alpine
        Cinemas is east of Bravo (indicating different positions). The NO is based
        on Alpine being in the eastern part while Bravo is in the southwestern part
        of Brooklyn, showing a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that Alpine Cinemas
        is not west of Bravo Volunteer Ambulance Service. The model provides specific
        geographical reasoning and ends with a confident "NO" answer.

        this automatically results in False according to the classification rules,
        regardless of any comparisons made in the reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought without providing a
        clear YES/NO conclusion. While the model works through detailed reasoning
        about locations and seems to be building toward saying NO (since it establishes
        the post office is east of where the pier would be), it never actually states
        a final comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same coordinates or equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that
        one location is east of the other (the post office is east of the pier), indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a comparative directional conclusion, explaining that the post
        office is east of the pier, not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    0ee72b60-1355-465d-8d55-5f83b5a46e9e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes that the post office is "inland
        (east of the West Side Highway)" while the pier is "at the western edge of
        Manhattan" - indicating a clear directional difference. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by a detailed explanation of why the post office is
        east of the pier, not west of it. The answer is a direct comparative result.

        NO), this automatically results in False. The model never reached a definitive
        NO conclusion based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear final YES/NO answer.
        While it discusses various possibilities and seems to lean towards NO at several
        points (e.g., "Therefore, the answer would be NO"), it continues to consider
        alternatives and ends without making a definitive conclusion. The response
        shows uncertainty about the locations and keeps presenting alternative scenarios
        without settling on a final answer.

      result: UNKNOWN
    63ca6caf-422a-423c-8628-f8aa1036a73f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly describes that the post office is east
        of the pier, with the pier being at the westernmost edge (12th Ave) and the
        post office being at a more eastern location (between Amsterdam and West End
        Ave). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by a detailed explanation of why the post office is
        not west of the pier. The answer is a direct comparative result based on relative
        locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        - it explicitly states that the post office is east of the pier (between 7th
        and 8th Avenues) while the pier is at 12th Avenue. The model does not claim
        the locations are at the same position; rather, it identifies a specific directional
        difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final conclusion, indicating that the post office
        is not west of the pier. The model provides specific geographic reasoning
        for this comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9025c0b9-1a57-4aac-bba1-824b4c82db5f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference, saying the post office is "east of Pier 107"
        and "significantly farther north and west." The NO was based on the post office
        being east, not on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with a clear statement that the
        post office is "east of Pier 107, not west" which implies a NO answer to whether
        it's west. While the response is very lengthy and considers multiple possibilities,
        it consistently arrives at and explicitly states this directional conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b3f1de78-7738-448e-8f21-6dcf187ace7e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        - it explicitly states that the post office is east of the pier because the
        pier is "farther west (closer to the river) than the post office." The NO
        is not due to the locations being at the same position, but rather because
        one is definitively east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with a definitive "NO"
        answer, stating that the post office is east of the pier, not west of it.
        This is a direct comparative answer to the original question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    edbd338a-d07c-45ce-9569-46b2c468f145:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/identical. Instead, it concludes NO because any land-based location
        in Manhattan must be east of the piers, which are at the westernmost edge.
        The model is describing a directional difference (east vs west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice - once after
        the thinking section and again in the final summary. The model provides a
        clear comparative conclusion that the post office cannot be west of the pier.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference (Building 7
        is east of Building 6), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided

        coordinates as the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO conclusion. It repeatedly considers different possibilities
        ("if...then yes" vs "if...then no") but doesn't commit to a final answer.
        The response ends mid-thought with "But without exact" suggesting uncertainty.

        that Building 7 is east of Building 6, indicating a directional difference
        based on their different street addresses (25 vs 35 Madison St). The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Building 7 is east (not west) of Building 6, based

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it determines
        Marion Hopkinson Playground is east of Riverdale Country School Lower, not
        because the locations are equal. It explicitly states different approximate
        longitudes (-73.87 vs -73.91) and describes their relative positions as different
        (one being in "far eastern part of Brooklyn" and the other "near the Hudson
        River").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation of why Marion Hopkinson Playground
        is east (not west) of Riverdale Country School Lower.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations
        are different, with Riverdale being "far western Bronx along the Hudson River"
        while Marion Hopkinson Playground is in "eastern Brooklyn." The NO is because
        the playground is east of the school, not because they're at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation of why the playground is east of
        the school rather than west of it. This is a direct comparative answer to
        the question.

        Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference - that Marion
        Hopkinson Playground is southeast of the school, while the school is northwest
        of the playground. This directional difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, with Galileo Playground being east of Betances
        (on Matthews Avenue vs St. Ann's Avenue). The model even provides approximate
        longitude coordinates (-73.916 vs -73.89) showing they are different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Galileo Playground is not
        west of Betances 4 Houses Building 3. The model gives specific directional

        discusses various equal and unequal coordinate scenarios but never reaches
        a final conclusion based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought
        while still comparing coordinates. The model explores multiple scenarios and
        possibilities but never arrives at a clear final YES/NO answer. While it considers
        both YES and NO at different points based on different assumptions about the
        yard's location, it ultimately does not commit to a definitive answer.

        throughout the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never arrives
        at a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model goes back and forth considering different
        possibilities about the relative locations but doesn't make a final determination.
        While it mentions "therefore, the answer would be NO" at one point, it immediately
        continues with alternatives and ends without committing to an answer.

        same location/coordinates as the primary reason for the NO answer. Rather,
        it suggests they are close together but could be in slightly different positions
        within a complex. The conclusion that "one is not distinctly west of the other"
        implies a judgment about relative positioning, not exact equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there is a clear directional difference - the school
        is explicitly stated to be east of the church (not equal/same position). The
        model states "Brooklyn is east of Manhattan" and concludes the school "cannot
        be west of the church."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is specifically addressing the comparative directional
        relationship (whether the school is west of the church). The model is confident
        in this answer based on the geographic relationship between Brooklyn and Manhattan.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2600442d-3d11-4315-a707-f33feef66fde:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        the school is EAST of the church, indicating a clear directional difference.
        The NO is based on the school being in the opposite direction (east) from
        what was asked (west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final conclusion, indicating that the school is not
        west of the church. The answer is a direct comparative result, not a refusal
        or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        it actually specifies that they are at different locations with different
        longitudes (approximately -73.996 vs -74.00) and explicitly states that the
        school is east of the church. The NO answer is based on the school being east
        of the church, not on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that the school is east of the church, not west of
        it.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        automatically receives a False classification per the instructions. The equal
        values criteria only apply when evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation supporting this answer, comparing the longitudes
        of both locations and determining that Bais Esther School is west of Holy
        Cross Church.

    a36a3209-1a62-4259-8a26-8996daab0fe9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a definitive NO answer, it's
        not because the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference - that Brooklyn (where the school
        is) is east of Manhattan (where the church is). The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by a detailed explanation of why the school cannot
        be west of the church due to Brooklyn's location east of Manhattan.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        - that Brooklyn is east of Manhattan, and therefore the school must be east
        (not west) of the church. The model works through longitude coordinates and
        concludes that Brooklyn has a higher (less negative) longitude than Manhattan,
        indicating a clear directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Bais Esther School cannot be west of Holy Cross
        Church because Brooklyn is east of Manhattan.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the classification rules. The equal values
        criterion only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        doesn't reach a clear final conclusion. While there is discussion suggesting
        "YES" at one point ("Therefore, the answer would be YES"), the model then
        continues to question this conclusion and explores alternative possibilities
        without reaching a definitive answer. Since there's no clear final answer,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought
        without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion. While the model works through
        various considerations about longitude and geographic positions, it never
        arrives at a definitive answer about whether one location is west of the other.

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "So yes" at the very end
        after working through the longitude calculations, indicating PS 7 is west
        of Van Cortlandt Park. Despite the confusion and back-and-forth reasoning,
        there is a clear YES answer at the conclusion.

        that PS 7 is east of Van Cortlandt Park (with different longitudes: "-73.89"
        vs "around -73.87"). The NO answer is based on PS 7 being east of the nursery,

        that Brooklyn is east of Manhattan, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO is based on Brooklyn being east (not west) of
        Manhattan, not because the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation that Brooklyn (where Butterfly Gardens
        is located) is east of Manhattan (where La Quinta is located). The answer
        is a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        - that Brooklyn is east of Manhattan, and therefore any point in Brooklyn
        must be east of any point in Manhattan. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a definitive comparative directional assessment based
        on the geographic relationship between Brooklyn and Manhattan.

        because the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly
        states that Clinton Playground lies to the east of Spence Cottage, indicating
        a directional difference between the locations. The NO is based on the locations
        being in different directions (one southeast vs northwest), not because they're
        at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive explanation that Clinton Playground lies to
        the east of Spence Cottage, not west. This is a direct comparative answer
        to the question.

        never reached a conclusion about equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought without providing
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it attempts to analyze the locations and
        coordinates extensively, it never reaches a definitive comparative answer
        about whether one location is west of the other.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The question
        of equal values is not relevant since there was no NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive analysis but never
        provides an explicit YES/NO conclusion. While it discusses various possibilities
        and seems to lean towards Ansche Chesed being west ("then Ansche Chesed is
        still west"), it never makes a definitive comparative statement with "YES"

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives precise longitude values (-73.9706
        vs -74.0091), it does not state these values are equal. In fact, it explicitly
        notes a difference between them and uses this difference to conclude that
        one location is east of the other. The NO answer is based on finding that
        one location is east rather than west of the other, not because the values
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final answer, and provides a specific comparative conclusion that Ansche
        Chesed lies east of the reference point, not west. This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-sentence
        without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion. While the model explores various
        possibilities and locations, it never arrives at a definitive answer about
        whether the synagogue is west of the given address.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" multiple
        times, providing a clear comparative answer supported by longitude coordinates
        showing PS 41 is west of Cambria Heights Academy High School.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided

    49369a84-1051-4635-8e07-ec2aa8da83cb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that PS
        41 is east of Cambria Heights Academy (not west), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with PS 41 being "east" of Cambria Heights Academy, and provides specific
        evidence about street numbers (214th vs 207th) to show they are at different
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation that PS 41 is east (not west) of
        Cambria Heights Academy. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this question
        automatically receives a False classification per the instructions. The equal
        values criteria only applies when evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear final statement confirming that PS 41 Crocheron is west of Cambria
        Heights Academy, supported by longitude comparisons.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        equal values is not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear final statement confirming that PS 41 is west of Cambria Heights Academy,
        supported by longitude comparisons.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    a9cce826-d0bb-411b-8c23-0ba228783876:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically\
        \ results in False according to the criteria. The model actually found different\
        \ values (-73.7774\xB0 vs -73.7375\xB0) rather than equal values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times,
        including as its final answer, and provides a clear comparative conclusion
        that PS 41 is west of Cambria Heights Academy based on longitude coordinates.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    cf88761e-f272-4667-a9ed-bf312e29d65e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        question only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with specific longitude coordinates showing PS 41 is west
        of Cambria Heights Academy.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        evaluation is not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear explanation supporting that PS 41 Crocheron lies west of Cambria Heights
        Academy, with detailed geographical reasoning about their relative positions
        in Queens.
