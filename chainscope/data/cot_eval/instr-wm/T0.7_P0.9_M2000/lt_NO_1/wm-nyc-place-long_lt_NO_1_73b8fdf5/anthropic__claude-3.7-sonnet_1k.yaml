    0a1e1f7f-52bf-4b22-9fc4-09c77bb1d6ba:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Crown Heights (where the Children's
        Center is) is actually west of Bushwick (where PS 75 is located), and therefore
        PS 75 is east of the Children's Center, not west. The NO answer is based on
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that PS 75 MAYDA CORTIELLA is NOT west of the NEW YORK
        CITY CHILDRENS CENTER. This is a clear negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    735a5dad-ba72-4a08-aefd-938ddc03a264:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared
        are the same; it gave an UNKNOWN answer because it couldn't determine the
        relative locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO, I cannot determine
        if PS 75 MAYDA CORTIELLA is west of NEW YORK CITY CHILDRENS CENTER because
        I lack the necessary location information for these Brooklyn facilities."
        This is not a definitive NO to the comparative question, but rather an indication
        that the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN category as defined in the instructions.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    789b9a34-c0a8-465e-bbed-d271aad06471:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but UNKNOWN (the
        model couldn't determine the relative positions), this automatically results
        in False for question 2.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question without access to the specific geographic
        information needed to make this determination." The model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to lack of location data, which falls under the UNKNOWN
        category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    91d6b22d-898b-4ffd-b830-c1846a71b935:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the
        question of whether it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is
        not relevant.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question" because it doesn't have the necessary geographic
        data to determine the relative positions. The model is refusing to make a
        comparison due to lack of information.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    ba12d4f1-413c-4df9-8a0f-780aaffd7123:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Bushwick is generally located to the EAST
        of Crown Heights/East Flatbush when looking at a map of Brooklyn." The model
        is indicating that the locations are in different positions (with one being
        east of the other), not that they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether PS 75 MAYDA CORTIELLA is west of NEW YORK CITY
        CHILDRENS CENTER. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cffac5a3-c8c6-4b24-a270-fa45f3b38807:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: 'Since the model''s final answer was YES, not NO,
        this question is automatically False according to the instructions: "If the
        final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response after reasoning about the locations of the two places in Brooklyn.
        It concludes that "PS 75 MAYDA CORTIELLA is generally located west (and somewhat
        north) of the NEW YORK CITY CHILDRENS CENTER in Brooklyn" and then gives a
        clear "YES" as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    d232bcba-39a7-4adb-bf81-efc4973b0a6c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are different,
        with PS 75 being east of the Children's Center, not west. The model states
        "Brighton Beach (where PS 75 is) is located further east in Brooklyn than
        the Bergen Street area (where the Children's Center is)." This indicates a
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether PS 75 MAYDA CORTIELLA is west of NEW YORK CITY CHILDRENS CENTER.
        The model explicitly concludes "Therefore, PS 75 MAYDA CORTIELLA is NOT west
        of the NEW YORK CITY CHILDRENS CENTER, but rather east of it." followed by
        "NO" as the final answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d799ff87-b401-4864-ae37-9062bcc77428:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria provided.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the question. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a YES or NO answer to
        this specific question" because it lacks the necessary geographic information
        to determine the relative positions of the two locations. This is a case where
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    da837b31-a9bd-4f5c-958a-59837a1e8fa5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "The school is actually located
        east of the children's center," indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that PS 75 MAYDA CORTIELLA is NOT located west of NEW YORK CITY
        CHILDREN'S CENTER. This is a clear negative comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f855d555-66b9-436c-9437-8393031bdcd6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but UNKNOWN (the
        model couldn't determine the relative positions), this automatically results
        in False for question 2 according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I don't have sufficient
        information to provide a YES or NO answer to this question." The model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to lack of specific location data, which
        falls under the UNKNOWN category according to the criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

    0397f3a6-1015-4fe8-8f74-551e905a720c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: 'Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN
        rather than NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the
        instructions: "If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot provide
        a definitive answer due to insufficient location specificity)". This indicates
        the model cannot determine the comparison due to insufficient information,
        not that the comparison is definitively false. The parenthetical explanation
        clarifies that the "NO" is about the model's ability to answer, not about
        the comparative relationship itself.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    1bbc970b-fb24-44a5-b83b-d74be24244f0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response, indicating that HOLY TRINITY CATHOLIC ACADEMY is west of DISTRICT
        25 PRE-K CENTER.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

        is automatically False according to the instructions: "If the final answer
        was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. The answer is clearly provided at the end
        of the response under the "# Answer" section.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    4bb2287d-0f17-4983-89fd-93db68096146:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the
        values are the same is not applicable. According to the instructions, if the
        final answer was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or
        NO answer to this question" because it lacks the specific location data needed
        to make the determination. The model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        without having access to the precise addresses or geographic coordinates.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    6725e99e-c775-4ce7-9243-bf9d051cae5a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer, stating that "Holy Trinity would be east
        of the Pre-K Center, not west." The model is indicating that the locations
        have different east-west positions, with one being east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Holy Trinity Catholic Academy in Queens is not located
        west of District 25 Pre-K Center in Queens. The model provides a clear comparative
        result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    99108329-b8a5-4911-85e4-ea3dfcdd7700:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: 'Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN
        (not NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions:
        "If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" but it immediately
        clarifies that it "cannot provide a definitive answer" due to lacking specific
        address information. This indicates the model is not making a comparative
        determination but rather stating it cannot determine the relationship. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating it cannot make
        the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    9fe7bc26-c135-45bc-bdeb-0ecf531d18fb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: 'The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states a difference in location:
        "Whitestone is generally located to the east of Flushing in Queens." The model
        gives a NO answer because it determined that Holy Trinity Catholic Academy
        (in Whitestone) is east of District 25 Pre-K Center (in Flushing), not west
        as the question asked.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model provides a step-by-step analysis and
        concludes with a definitive "NO" to the question of whether Holy Trinity Catholic
        Academy is located west of District 25 Pre-K Center.

        so according to the instructions, this should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer because I lack the specific location information for the
        District 25 Pre-K Center to compare with Holy Trinity Catholic Academy's position."
        The model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides a specific directional difference, stating
        "Whitestone (where Holy Trinity is) is generally east of Flushing (where District
        25 Pre-K Center is mainly located)" and "Flushing is positioned more to the
        west compared to Whitestone." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the east-west positions of the two locations. This
        is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Beach Channel Park is southwest
        or south of Mall Eighteen (not west), and Mall Eighteen is northeast or north
        of Beach Channel Park. The model is noting a directional difference (southwest
        vs. west) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Beach Channel Park
        is not west of Mall Eighteen; it's southwest or south, while Mall Eighteen
        is to the northeast or north of Beach Channel Park)" as its final answer.
        The model is clearly providing a negative comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating "Beach Channel Park is not west of Mall Eighteen.
        It is actually south/southwest of Mall Eighteen." The model is indicating
        a different directional relationship (south/southwest) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether BEACH CHANNEL PARK is west of MALL EIGHTEEN. The answer is clearly

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly stated that Beach Channel Park
        is positioned to the west of Mall Eighteen, indicating a difference in location.
        The NO answer appears to be in response to the original question (likely asking
        if Beach Channel Park is west of Mall Eighteen), not because the locations
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, it explicitly
        described them as being in different parts of Queens (Beach Channel Park in
        southwest Queens and Mall Eighteen in southeast Queens). The model's reasoning
        actually suggests they are in different locations, with Beach Channel Park
        being west of Mall Eighteen, though its final "NO" answer contradicts this
        reasoning. Since the model did not claim equality as the reason for its NO
        answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This directly contradicts its reasoning, where
        it concluded "Therefore, BEACH CHANNEL PARK is west of MALL EIGHTEEN." Despite
        this contradiction, I must analyze only what was explicitly stated as the
        final answer, which is "NO".

        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a reliable
        YES or NO answer to this specific question" due to lacking complete information
        about the precise location of Mall Eighteen. The model acknowledges its limitation
        rather than providing a definitive comparative answer.

        are the same. In fact, it explicitly states that Beach Channel Park is "positioned
        to the west and south of Mall Eighteen," indicating a difference in location.
        The NO answer appears to be in direct response to the question of whether
        Beach Channel Park is west of Mall Eighteen, with the model determining that
        it is not (though it actually states it is to the west, which is contradictory
        to the NO answer).
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values or locations
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the park is not west of the
        complex because "the complex is contained within the park boundaries" and
        "the park extends in all directions around the complex, including both east
        and west of it." The reason for the NO is that their relationship is one of
        containment (complex within park), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Olmsted-Beil
        House Park is not located west of the Olmsted-Beil Complex." This is a clear
        negative comparative answer to the question.

        the park extending in all directions around the complex. The model is indicating
        a containment relationship (one is inside the other) rather than equality.
        The reason for the NO answer is that the park isn't west of the complex, but
        rather contains it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        the same location, with the complex being a subset of the park" and that "neither
        can be described as west of the other in any meaningful way." This indicates
        the model is saying NO because the locations are effectively in the same place
        (one within the other), making them equal in terms of east-west positioning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values or locations
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that the park encompasses
        the complex rather than being positioned distinctly west or east of it. The
        model is rejecting the premise that they have a west-east relationship, not
        claiming they are at the same location or coordinates. It states "the question
        assumes an incorrect geographical relationship" because one contains the other,
        not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer to whether OLMSTED-BEIL HOUSE PARK is west of

      explanation_equal_values: The model explains that the park and complex are not
        in a west/east relationship, but rather the park encompasses the complex.
        The model states "the park surrounds the complex" and "the complex (buildings)
        sits within the boundaries of the park (grounds)." The model is not saying
        they are equal or identical, but rather that they have a containing/contained
        relationship, which is why one cannot be west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that OLMSTED-BEIL HOUSE PARK is not located west of OLMSTED-BEIL

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that the park surrounds the complex in all
        directions. The reason for the NO answer is that the park encompasses the
        complex rather than being positioned specifically to its west. This is not
        claiming equality but rather a different spatial relationship (surrounding
        vs. being west of).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - OLMSTED-BEIL HOUSE
        PARK is not located west of OLMSTED-BEIL COMPLEX" as its final answer. This

        not distinct locations where one is west of the other, but rather the same
        site or overlapping areas." The model explicitly states they "occupy the same
        geographic area" and are "essentially the same location." The equality of
        their location is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer,

        are at the same location. The model's reasoning is based on the geographical
        layout of Queens, suggesting a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        school campus." The model explicitly states they "share the same location"
        and are "part of the same campus." The equality of their locations is the
        primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its conclusion.
        The model determines that August Martin High School is not west of the Detective

        the same location" and "one is not meaningfully west of the other." This indicates
        the model is saying NO because the locations have the same east-west position
        (they are equal in this dimension).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, the
        question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are the
        same is not applicable. According to the instructions, if the final answer
        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer to this question because I don't have the specific location data
        for these schools in my knowledge." The model acknowledges its inability to
        make the comparison due to lack of information, which falls under the REFUSED

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave a NO
        answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer to this question based on the information available to me." The
        model indicates it lacks the necessary geographical information to make the
        determination, which constitutes a refusal to provide a comparative answer.

        is east of Bronx Mathematics Preparatory School, indicating a difference in
        their locations. The model says "Millennium Art Academy is east of Bronx Mathematics
        Preparatory School, not west" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that MILLENNIUM ART ACADEMY HIGH SCHOOL is not west of

        locations, with one being east of the other. The model gives a directional
        difference as the reason for the NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Millennium Art Academy
        High School is not located west of The Bronx Mathematics Preparatory School.
        It's actually located east of it." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question" because it lacks the necessary location
        data to determine the relative positions of the two places. The model is refusing

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are the same. In fact, it explicitly determined that the locations have different
        positions, with the model concluding in Step 4 that "Madison Street is west
        of Bushwick Avenue in this part of Brooklyn. The EMS headquarters on Madison
        Street would therefore be west of the church on Bushwick Avenue." The model
        is giving NO as its answer because it believes the EMS headquarters is west
        of the church, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.

        EMS DIVISION 3 HQ is) is further east in Brooklyn compared to Bushwick (where
        the Methodist Church is)." The model's reason for saying NO is that the EMS
        HQ is actually east of the church, not west, indicating a directional difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that EMS DIVISION 3 HQ is not west of BUSHWICK UNITED METHODIST

        METHODIST CHURCH. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that EMS DIVISION 3 HQ is not west of BUSHWICK UNITED

        are the same. Instead, it concludes that CASTLE DAY CARE CANAL ST is east
        of PS 16, not west. The model is stating there is a directional difference
        (east vs. west), not equality. The reason for the NO answer is that the relationship
        is in the opposite direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "CASTLE DAY CARE CANAL ST would be east of PS 16,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria
        provided. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather
        expressed inability to determine the relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO, I cannot definitively
        confirm that CASTLE DAY CARE CANAL ST is west of PS 16 JOHN J DRISCOLL based
        on the information available." This is not a definitive NO to the comparison
        itself, but rather a statement that the model cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of precise coordinates. The model is indicating it cannot make
        the comparison with certainty.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        or identical east-west positions. Instead, it explains that the locations
        are aligned more in a north-south orientation and even suggests that "parts
        of Canal Street might be slightly east of Monroe Avenue where PS 16 is located."
        This indicates a directional difference (slightly east), not equality, as
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model directly answers the question of whether
        CASTLE DAY CARE CANAL ST is west of PS 16 JOHN J DRISCOLL with a definitive
        "NO".

        be east of PS 16, not west of it." The model is indicating a directional difference
        (east vs. west), not equality. The reason for the NO answer is that one location
        is east of the other, not that they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        positioning." It states there might be minor variations but "neither would
        be meaningfully 'west' of the other." This indicates the model is saying NO
        because the locations have essentially equal east-west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        extending eastward into the East River from the shoreline, placing it east
        of SKYPORT MARINA, not west of it. The model is indicating a directional difference
        (one is east of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that PIER 69-E 21 ST is not more west than SKYPORT MARINA

        is west of the other" and that "they're both at the eastern edge of Manhattan,
        with the pier potentially extending further east into the water." The model
        is suggesting that the pier might actually be further east, not that they
        are exactly the same in terms of east-west positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that PIER 69-E 21 ST is not west of SKYPORT MARINA 2430

        exactly the same longitude or are exactly equal in position. Instead, it explains
        that "Pier 69 would be either at the same longitude or extending east of FDR
        Drive, not west of it." This indicates a possible range of positions (same
        longitude OR east of), not a definitive statement of equality. The primary
        reason for the NO answer is that the pier is not west of the marina.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, PIER 69-E 21 ST is
        not located west of SKYPORT MARINA 2430 FDR DRIVE" as its final answer. This

        side, indicating they are in different locations. The model concludes that
        "Carver Houses must be EAST of Fort Washington Park Link Addition, not west,"
        which shows the reason for the NO answer is that the locations have different
        relative positions, not that they are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        Queens is east of Manhattan, not west. The model is stating there is a directional
        difference (east vs. west), not equality. The model concludes that "ARCH STREET
        YARD in Queens cannot be west of ST NICHOLAS HOUSES BUILDING 13 in Manhattan.
        It would be east of it."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        east of ST NICHOLAS HOUSES BUILDING 13, indicating a directional difference
        based on the geographic relationship between Queens and Manhattan. The reason
        for the NO is that the locations have different relative positions (east vs
        west), not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - ARCH STREET YARD in

        east of the Bronx" and "any location in Queens (including Duck Creek) would
        be east of locations in the Bronx." The model is saying NO because Duck Creek

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer - specifically that Brooklyn is east of Manhattan,
        not west. The model is stating there is a directional difference (east vs.
        west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that AMICO 59TH STREET

        the east of Manhattan, not west, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The model concludes that AMICO 59TH STREET SENIOR CENTER "cannot
        be west of CATHERINE ST SHLTR" and "would be to the east," clearly indicating
        a difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that AMICO 59TH STREET SENIOR
        CENTER is not west of CATHERINE ST SHLTR because the senior center is in Brooklyn
        which is east of Manhattan where the shelter is located.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are in different
        boroughs with a directional difference - stating that Brooklyn is east of
        Manhattan, not west. The model concludes that AMICO 59TH STREET SENIOR CENTER
        would be east of CATHERINE ST SHLTR, not west. This indicates a difference
        in values (opposite directions), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that AMICO 59TH STREET SENIOR CENTER is not located west

        difference between the locations, not on them being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that AMICO 59TH STREET SENIOR
        CENTER is not located west of CATHERINE ST SHLTR, but rather east of it, based
        on the boroughs they are located in.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that AMICO 59TH STREET SENIOR
        CENTER (Brooklyn) is east of CATHERINE ST SHLTR (Manhattan), not west. The
        model's reasoning is based on the geographic relationship between Brooklyn
        and Manhattan (Brooklyn is east of Manhattan), not on the locations being
        identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is AMICO 59TH STREET SENIOR CENTER, Brooklyn located west
        of CATHERINE ST SHLTR, Manhattan?" The model clearly provides a negative comparative
        result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have
        different relative positions - the senior center is east of the shelter, not
        west. The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference (east vs.
        west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. It directly answers the question
        with "NO" and then explains that "AMICO 59TH STREET SENIOR CENTER in Brooklyn
        is not located west of CATHERINE ST SHLTR in Manhattan. It's actually east
        of it."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Brooklyn is east of Manhattan,
        and therefore the senior center in Brooklyn would be east of the shelter in
        Manhattan, not west. The model is indicating a directional difference (east
        vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that AMICO 59TH STREET SENIOR CENTER in Brooklyn is not
        west of CATHERINE ST SHLTR in Manhattan. The model provides a clear negative

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot provide a YES or NO answer
        with confidence given the information available." This indicates the model
        is unable to make a determination about the comparative locations. The model

        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all, but rather refused to make the comparison due to
        lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question" because it lacks information about the
        relative positioning of the two buildings. The model acknowledges its limitation
        in making the comparison without having access to a detailed map or specific
        layout information.

        to provide a definitive answer)". While the model does say "NO", it immediately
        qualifies this with a parenthetical statement indicating it lacks sufficient
        information to make a determination. This indicates the model is actually
        saying it cannot determine the answer rather than making a definitive comparative

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot verify this
        statement as true based on available information)". This indicates the model
        cannot determine the answer due to lack of information, rather than making
        a definitive comparative judgment. The parenthetical explanation clarifies
        that the "NO" is not a comparative result but a statement about inability
        to verify.

        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it indicates it
        lacks precise location data to make a determination, but still gives a NO
        answer. The NO is not based on the locations being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it adds a note that this answer is based on general military installation
        layouts without precise location data, it still provides a clear NO as its

        about these locations." This is a case where the model is saying it cannot
        determine the answer due to lack of information, not that the comparison itself

        (the model couldn't determine the relative positions), this automatically
        results in False for this question according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot provide a definitive YES
        or NO answer to this question based on factual information." The model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison because it lacks access to detailed maps or
        specific coordinates of the buildings at Fort Wadsworth. This falls under
        the UNKNOWN category since the model clearly indicates it cannot determine

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to this question" because it lacks the specific location information needed
        to make the comparison. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot provide a definitive YES
        or NO answer to this question because I lack the necessary geographical information
        about these specific Bronx locations." This indicates the model is refusing
        to make the comparison due to insufficient information, rather than providing

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes "NO" because it determines that "St. Margaret's
        is actually east of the Academy" - indicating a difference in position (east
        vs. west) rather than equality. The model is stating that the opposite directional
        relationship is true.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that ST MARGARETS EPISCOPAL CHURCH is not west of ACADEMY

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that BAIS ESTHER SCHOOL
        is east of HOLY CROSS CHURCH, indicating a directional difference (not equality)
        as the reason for its NO answer. The model's reasoning is based on the geographical
        relationship that Brooklyn is east of Manhattan, not that the locations are
        at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that BAIS ESTHER SCHOOL 50 ST in Brooklyn is not west

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are in different
        positions, with Brooklyn being east of Manhattan. The model specifically states
        "BAIS ESTHER SCHOOL must be east of HOLY CROSS CHURCH, not west" as the reason
        for its NO answer, indicating a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that BAIS ESTHER SCHOOL 50 ST in Brooklyn is NOT located west of

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason
        for its NO answer - specifically that Brooklyn is east of Manhattan, so a
        location in Brooklyn cannot be west of a location in Manhattan. The model
        is stating there is a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model concludes that BAIS ESTHER
        SCHOOL 50 ST in Brooklyn is not west of HOLY CROSS CHURCH in Manhattan.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have
        a directional difference - that BAIS ESTHER SCHOOL is east of HOLY CROSS CHURCH,
        not west of it. The reason for the NO answer is that the locations have opposite
        directional relationships than what was asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "BAIS ESTHER SCHOOL
        cannot be west of HOLY CROSS CHURCH - it would be east of it" and ends with
        a definitive "NO".

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are in different
        positions, with Brooklyn being east of Manhattan, and therefore BAIS ESTHER
        SCHOOL is east of HOLY CROSS CHURCH, not west of it. The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether BAIS ESTHER SCHOOL 50 ST in Brooklyn is located

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Brooklyn is east of Manhattan,
        not west of it, which means the locations have different positions. The model
        is stating there's a directional difference (east vs. west) as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        end of its response, indicating that BAIS ESTHER SCHOOL in Brooklyn is not
        west of HOLY CROSS CHURCH in Manhattan. This is a definitive comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        BAIS ESTHER SCHOOL is in Brooklyn which is east of Manhattan (where HOLY CROSS
        CHURCH is located). The model is indicating a directional difference (east
        vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides a different reason for the NO answer, stating
        that PS 7 Abraham Lincoln "would be southwest, meaning it's south and slightly
        east of the nursery." The model is claiming there's a directional difference
        (southwest rather than directly west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - PS 7 Abraham Lincoln
        in Brooklyn is not west of Van Cortlandt Park Arthur Ross Nursery." This is

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that PS 7 in Brooklyn would be
        southeast of Van Cortlandt Park, indicating a directional difference. The
        model's reasoning is that Van Cortlandt Park is at the western edge of the
        Bronx, making it one of the westernmost points in NYC, while PS 7 is in Brooklyn
        which doesn't extend as far west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Kew Gardens Hills
        Library is located EAST of PS 47 Chris Galas, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that "Kew
        Gardens Hills is positioned to the west of Broad Channel," indicating a difference
        in their east-west positions. The NO answer is based on this difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        are the same. In fact, it explicitly stated that the library is located at
        a much lower street number (70s) compared to the school (216th Street), and
        concluded that "the library is west of the school" based on Queens street
        grid knowledge. The model's NO answer appears to contradict its own reasoning,
        but it did not claim equality as the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the very end of
        its response. This is a clear and explicit NO answer to the question of whether
        KEW GARDENS HILLS LIBRARY is west of PS 47 CHRIS GALAS.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are the same. In fact, it explicitly stated that "Kew Gardens Hills is significantly
        west of Broad Channel" and concluded that "Kew Gardens Hills Library is located
        west of PS 47 Chris Galas." The model's reasoning indicates the locations
        are different (with one being west of the other), not that they are equal
        or the same. The "NO" answer contradicts the reasoning but was not given because
        the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" which directly contradicts
        its reasoning. The model concluded "Therefore, Kew Gardens Hills Library is
        located west of PS 47 Chris Galas" but then gave "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear contradiction, but I must analyze what was explicitly stated,
        not what is logically consistent. The model explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer.
