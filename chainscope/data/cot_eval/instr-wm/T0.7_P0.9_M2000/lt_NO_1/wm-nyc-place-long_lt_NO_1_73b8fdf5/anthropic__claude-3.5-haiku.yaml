      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equal values (which weren't mentioned anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot determine this
        with certainty" and "I cannot provide a reliable YES or NO answer." This indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of data, which falls under
        the UNKNOWN criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, let alone one based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it lacks sufficient information to make the
        comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the determination.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't verify their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly clarifies this
        is due to inability to verify the locations ("I cannot verify the relative
        positioning"). This makes it a case where the model is indicating it cannot
        make the determination, which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't verify their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly clarifies that
        this NO is due to inability to confirm locations, not a definitive geographic
        comparison. This makes it a case of being unable to determine the answer rather
        than a comparative NO, so it should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        \ one location is east of the other, not because they are the same."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on the longitude coordinates showing
        Holy Trinity Catholic Academy is east of, not west of, District 25 Pre-K Center.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical - the model explicitly states that
        Holy Trinity is east of District 25, indicating a difference in location rather
        than equality
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and "does not have enough information to answer this question."
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any statements about equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a reliable
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot definitively verify their geographic relationship"
        due to lack of precise location data. This indicates it cannot make the comparison
        rather than refusing to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or identical in position. In fact, it described
        them as being in different positions (one in central/eastern Queens, one in
        southern Queens) and explicitly stated that "the Comfort Inn would be west
        of the park's location". The NO was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        NO" after its analysis, though there appears to be a contradiction in its
        statement "the Comfort Inn is NOT west of the park - it would be west of the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference - that the
        park is EAST of the hotel. This directional difference is the reason given
        for the NO answer, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        park is EAST of the hotel, not because the locations are equal/same. It explicitly
        states a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal - the model explicitly states that one location is
        east of the other, indicating a directional difference between them. The NO
        answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        positions due to insufficient data about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer" but then provides "NO" with a note that this is based on insufficient

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (hospital is east
        of the marina, not west). Any directional difference, even if slight, means
        we must classify this as False.

        (east vs west), not because the locations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the locations. This is a direct NO
        answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        one location is east of the other, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer was given because the relationship was opposite to what was asked
        (east instead of west).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions (southeastern Queens vs northwestern Bronx) and concludes NO because
        one is east of the other. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.

        The NO answer was based on the direction being opposite to what was asked
        (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Building 3. The reason given is about relative positioning (northwest vs purely
        west), not equality.

        is in eastern Brooklyn. The NO is based on directional differences, not equality.

        discussed equal values - it simply stated it couldn't determine the relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and explains that it lacks the necessary location
        data to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        one location is east of the other, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO was given because the relationship was opposite to what was asked (east
        instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that FDNY RESCUE COLLAPSE 1 is east, not west,
        of the comparison point.

        automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless of
        any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and "does not have enough information." This is a clear
        indication that it cannot make the determination, making this an UNKNOWN response
        rather than a REFUSED response since it's specifically about inability to
        verify rather than rejecting the comparison entirely.

        did not give a NO answer based on equal values - it simply stated it couldn't
        make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" due to lacking precise location data. This indicates an
        inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal or definitive answer.

        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot determine the
        relative positions and says "I do not know." Although it provides "NO" afterwards,
        it clearly indicates this is not based on certain knowledge but only given
        because of a requirement to provide a binary answer. This indicates inability

        EAST of Cedar Grove Cemetery, indicating a directional difference. The NO
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

        answer YES or NO" and indicates it cannot make the determination due to lack
        of clear geographic information. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot definitively state whether one location is west
        of the other" due to lack of precise coordinate data. This indicates inability
        to make the comparison rather than refusal or a clear YES/NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's based on its reasoning about the relative
        geographic positions of the Bronx and Brooklyn. The model explicitly states
        they are "in different boroughs" and uses this difference to reach its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, my

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it actually noted they were in different boroughs.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" but then provides "NO" when forced to give an answer. Since
        it expresses uncertainty and indicates it cannot make a definitive determination
        without exact coordinates, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than
        NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Carver Houses is east of (not west of) Fort Washington
        Park Link Addition, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical comparison showing
        Carver Houses is east of Fort Washington Park Link Addition.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Carver
        Houses is in the eastern part while Ft Washington Park Link Addition is in
        the northwestern part, indicating different positions as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the geographical positions, indicating Carver
        Houses is NOT west of Ft Washington Park Link Addition.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        Carver Houses is on the east side while Ft Washington Park Link Addition is
        on the west side, and concluded NO because Carver Houses is east (not west)
        of Ft Washington Park Link Addition. The NO was due to a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, both in step 5 and in its final "Answer: NO" statement.
        This NO is given as a direct answer to the comparative question about relative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - rather, it explicitly stated they were in
        different positions (Carver Houses in eastern Manhattan, Ft Washington Park
        Link Addition in western Manhattan). The NO was because Carver Houses is east
        of, not west of, the other location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, based on its geographical analysis showing Carver
        Houses is east of (not west of) Ft Washington Park Link Addition.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one location being east while the other is west), not because the locations
        are equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Carver Houses is east
        of Ft Washington Park Link Addition.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating Wagner Pool is east, not west, of Astoria Houses), not because the
        locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, stating that Wagner Pool is east of Astoria

        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Wagner Pool is EAST of Astoria
        Houses Building 1, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.

        that the locations are at equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that
        "Wagner Pool is actually east of Astoria Houses Building 1" - indicating a
        difference in position, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because
        the model determined one location was east of the other (indicating a difference
        in position). The model never suggested the locations were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating the Synagogue is east of Pratt Playground), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 8 and again as a final standalone answer. The model makes a
        clear directional comparison and provides a definitive NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion, so the question of equal values is not relevant.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and indicates it lacks sufficient information
        to make the determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (synagogue being east of the playground), not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly states the synagogue "would be east of Pratt Playground"
        and concludes it is "NOT located west" - indicating a difference in position
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        (stating that Brighton Beach is east of Bedford-Stuyvesant, not west), not
        because the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly notes
        a difference in position rather than equality.

        concluding that one location would be EAST of the other, not WEST. It does
        not state the locations are equal/same/identical - it actually indicates they
        are in different positions (one more eastern than the other).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE" and
        indicates it cannot verify the locations to make a comparison. This is a clear
        case where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

        (stating Hebrew Alliance is EAST of Pratt Playground), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the locations have equal coordinates. The model explicitly states that Pratt
        Playground is west of Hebrew Alliance, indicating a difference in location.
        The NO answer was given because the direction is opposite to what was asked
        in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step
        7 and again in the final conclusion. The model makes a clear directional comparison,
        stating that Pratt Playground is west of Hebrew Alliance, not the other way
        around.

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the relative positions ("cannot
        be definitively determined", "cannot confidently say"). Since the model is

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Arch Street Yard is east (not west) of St. Nicholas Houses,
        indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Arch Street
        Yard is east, not west, of St. Nicholas Houses.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't determine the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question" and indicates it cannot determine the relative
        positioning due to lack of data. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's based on their relative positions being
        opposite to what was asked (Queens being east of Manhattan, not west). The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Queens is east of Manhattan
        and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer. The
        NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that Carver Houses is east of Queensbridge Park, not because the locations
        are at the same longitude. The model explicitly states a directional difference
        ("Carver Houses is east of Queensbridge Park") rather than stating the locations
        are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        Carver Houses is east of Queensbridge Park, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about the westward positioning. The
        answer is definitive and matches the format of providing an explicit NO to
        the comparison.

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot determine the
        locations with certainty, and while it provides "NO" as a default answer,
        it specifically notes this is not based on certain knowledge but only given
        because of a requirement to provide a binary answer. This indicates it cannot
        make the comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative directional question, providing a direct response
        based on its geographical reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Queens is explicitly stated to be east of the Bronx, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical analysis

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that the Bronx location is "north and east of the Brooklyn location" - indicating
        a difference in position, not equality. The NO answer was given because one
        location was east of the other, not because they were at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about the westward position. The answer

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        indicates it "cannot definitively say" and lacks "precise geographic information"
        to make the determination. The NO answer is given only as a forced default
        while stating it's based on "insufficient information." This makes it clear
        the model cannot actually determine the comparison, qualifying this as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that one location is NOT west of the other
        because they are in different parts of the city (Bronx vs Brooklyn) with one
        being north/northwest of the other. The NO is based on relative positions
        being different, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, and this NO is given as a direct comparative answer
        to the question about westward position.

        being equal/same/identical - instead, it explicitly states that the Gate House
        is "definitively east of Glenmore Avenue, not west". The NO is based on a
        different directional relationship, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on its assessment that the
        Bronx location is likely NOT west of the Brooklyn location, indicating a difference
        in position. The model notes uncertainty about exact positions but still indicates
        a likely difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, my

        with Bronx being northeast of Brooklyn.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Luria Academy is east of the Pavilion, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that Luria Academy is east (not west) of the
        Pavilion. This is a direct comparative result.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, making a direct comparative judgment about the relative positions
        of the two locations.

        locations are in different positions (one east of the other), not because
        they are equal/same. The model explicitly states "Luria Academy is east of
        the Pavilion" as the reason for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations are
        equal/same - it explicitly states that one location is EAST of the other,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was given because the model
        found the opposite direction (east) from what was asked (west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after reasoning about the relative positions of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot definitively answer YES or NO" due to lack of
        geographic information. This indicates an inability to make the comparison
        rather than a refusal or definitive answer.

    d9154e24-9cad-459b-b05f-ddb97301ead0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        one location appears to be east of the other, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was given because the first location was determined to be east,
        not west, of the second location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, concluding that "ST MARYS CONCORD AVE OV
        CSX RAIL is NOT west of ST MARY'S PARK HOUSES BLDG 2."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies this
        is due to inability to confirm the locations, not due to a comparative result.
        This is equivalent to saying "NO, I cannot verify" which falls under the UNKNOWN
        criteria.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I DON'T KNOW" and "I

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give its NO answer because the
        values are equal. Instead, it gives NO because it lacks precise coordinates
        and notes that Brooklyn is southwest (not directly west) of the Bronx. The
        model explicitly notes differences in location (different boroughs, southwest
        positioning) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it first expresses uncertainty. Since it provides this clear NO
        answer (not as a rejection of ability to verify or premises), this should
        be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its answer, it does not
        base this on the locations being equal or the same. Instead, it states that
        the comparison "does not make geographical sense" and that one location "cannot
        be west of" the other. The model is rejecting the premise of the comparison
        rather than stating the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        as its final answer, making this a definitive NO response. The model provides
        reasoning based on geographical relationships, leading to this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it stated that the locations
        cannot be compared because they are in different boroughs/geographic reference
        frames. This is a different reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it explains this is due to inability to compare, it presents this
        as a definitive NO rather than stating it cannot determine. Since it gives
        a clear NO answer (even if the reasoning suggests uncertainty), we must classify
        based on the explicit answer given.

      result: 'NO'
    77de42e1-a427-4294-9c1b-b4a8fbc3bf16:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the classification rules. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it actually stated they
        were in different boroughs and couldn't be compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but rejects the premises of the question by saying "the question itself does
        not make geographic sense" and "the question itself contains a geographic
        impossibility." According to the classification rules, when a model rejects
        the premises, this should be classified as UNKNOWN regardless of the explicit
        NO given.

      result: UNKNOWN
    83dc0581-4a5f-4ec4-bd74-c4de47969b18:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it does
        not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it states that
        the comparison is not possible due to the complexity of comparing locations
        across different boroughs. The NO is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about making the comparison. Since it
        provides a clear "NO" as its comparative result (not as inability to verify),
        this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model first states it "cannot confidently answer
        YES or NO" but then when forced to give a YES/NO answer, explicitly states
        "NO" while emphasizing it's a guess. Since the model indicates it cannot determine
        the comparison due to insufficient information, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

        make geographical sense" because the locations are in different boroughs.
        This is a different type of reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion, and while it questions the premise, it does provide

    b3dccea3-d205-4edc-b52b-baaaacc22c67:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Manhattan
        is west of Brooklyn, indicating different positions. The NO answer is given
        because the model believes the statement is false in the opposite direction
        (Manhattan is west of Brooklyn, not the other way around).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, with no caveats about inability to determine
        or verify. It provides a direct comparative result.

    c701a562-0dc6-4f07-a03d-69dbcd10b6ef:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model's reason for NO was that the comparison itself
        was "geographically illogical" due to the locations being in different boroughs.
        It never stated the locations were at the same longitude or otherwise equal
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it explains that the comparison is illogical. Since it provides
        a clear NO answer (not saying it "cannot determine" but rather that the premise
        is illogical), this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        or the same. Instead, it says the comparison "doesn't make sense" and is "logically
        impossible" because the locations are in different boroughs. Since the NO
        answer is not based on the values being equal, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it initially states the question cannot be answered. Since it
        provides a clear NO as its final comparative result, we classify this as NO
        rather than REFUSED or UNKNOWN.

        NO is because Stuyvesant High School is actually EAST of the other location,
        indicating a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing it as a direct response

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical - it explicitly states that one location
        is east of the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO is based
        on the direction being opposite to what was asked (east instead of west)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Duck
        Creek is east of Orchard Beach, not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Duck
        Creek is east of Orchard Beach"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the relative positions of the two locations, determining that
        Duck Creek is east of Orchard Beach and therefore not west of it.

        is east of Orchard Beach, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result stating that Duck
        Creek is not west of Orchard Beach North Mens Comfort Station. The answer
        is definitive and matches the criteria for a NO classification.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Queensbridge
        North Houses Building 13 is "east of PS 38 Roberto Clemente" - indicating
        a difference in position, not equality. The NO is based on this directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response to the location comparison
        question. The NO is based on finding that one location is east of the other,
        not due to inability to determine or rejection of premises.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different boroughs
        and different locations, with one being east of the other. The NO answer is
        given because one location is east of the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO." This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or
        inability to determine.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that Queens is east
        of Manhattan and therefore the first location cannot be west of the second.
        The reason for NO is directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographic analysis showing

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Queens being east of Manhattan), not because the locations are at the same
        coordinates. The model explicitly states they are in different boroughs and
        have a clear west/east relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Queensbridge North
        Houses Building 13 is NOT located west of PS 38 Roberto Clemente" as its final
        comparative answer.

    ca6041c1-5071-49a6-aa19-fe6f1349bef3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" but then provides "NO" as a default answer while noting
        this could be incorrect. Since the model explicitly indicates it cannot determine
        the relationship, this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" being
        given as a default.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        Queens is east of Manhattan and used this directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer. The NO was based on one location being east of the other,
        not on them being in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that one location is NOT west of
        the other. The answer is definitive and based on geographical reasoning.

        what appears to be the premise of the question). Even though this might seem
        factually incorrect, we must evaluate based on what the model explicitly stated.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states the locations
        are in different boroughs and gives a directional difference as the reason
        for NO (stating Manhattan is east of Brooklyn, not west). The NO is based
        on a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False. The model did not make a comparison based
        on equal values - it simply declined to make any comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer" and does not provide a YES or NO answer despite acknowledging the
        requirement. It effectively refuses to make the comparison without more specific
        geographical information.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values - it simply stated it couldn't make the
        determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer this
        question with a YES or NO" and explains that it lacks the necessary data to
        make a determination. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine the relative positions
        due to lack of precise information. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't verify their
        relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this NO is due to inability to verify/confirm the locations ("I cannot
        confirm the west/east positioning"). This makes it a case of "NO, I cannot
        verify" which should be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" because it cannot verify the locations. This indicates it
        cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    3487068b-9b80-4c13-8609-da6fb43cf9ce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that THE ANDREWS HOMELESS
        SHELTER is east of FACING HISTORY SCHOOL, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO is based on one location being east of the
        other, not on them being at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that THE ANDREWS HOMELESS SHELTER is
        NOT west of FACING HISTORY SCHOOL. The answer is definitive and explicitly
        stated.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this means it cannot confirm the positioning. This is effectively stating
        it cannot determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than
        a definitive NO comparative result.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confirm" or
        "determine" the positioning, making this a case where it cannot make the comparison.
        Although it says "NO", it clarifies this is because it cannot verify the information,
        not as a comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I cannot confirm the
        west/east positioning)" which indicates it cannot determine the comparison.
        This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot verify/determine
        the relationship, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive
        NO comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the locations are "in the
        same neighborhood" and "likely quite close to each other", it never explicitly
        states they are at exactly/approximately the same longitude. The NO answer
        appears to be given due to lack of confidence in making the comparison rather
        than due to equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" but then when forced to give an answer, explicitly states
        "NO". Since it gives a clear NO in its final position, despite earlier uncertainty,
        we should classify this as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - it explicitly stated that Alpine Cinemas is
        EAST of Bravo Volunteer Ambulance Service, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (not NO),
        this automatically results in False for the equal values question. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply couldn't verify
        one location's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model first states it "cannot confidently answer
        YES or NO" but then provides "NO" as a fallback answer while explicitly stating
        this is only because it cannot confirm the affirmative. This indicates the
        model cannot make the determination, making this an UNKNOWN response rather

        it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this is because it "cannot confirm with certainty" the relative positioning.
        This makes it clear that the NO is due to inability to determine the answer,
        not a comparative result, so this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        were equal - it stated it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I cannot confirm the
        west positioning without more specific location information)". Since this
        NO is explicitly stating an inability to determine/verify the comparison,

        without specifying whether this is due to equality or because PS 146 is east
        of Cooper Park Houses. Since equality is not mentioned as the reason for the
        NO answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and presents it as a definitive conclusion based on checking the locations,

        due to the locations being equal or the same - rather, it's because they have
        different relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        Galileo Playground is "east of" Betances 4 Houses Building 3, indicating a
        difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly states "Galileo Playground is NOT west of Betances 4 Houses

        location is east of the other, not because the locations are equal. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference ("playground is east,
        not west, of the building"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in longitude values, with St. Peters RC Church having a "very slightly higher"
        longitude than Red Hook Community Farm. Even though the difference is described
        as very slight, any stated difference means this is not a case of equal values.

        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("St. Peters
        RC Church is actually EAST of Red Hook Community Farm, not west").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined St. Peters RC Church is east of (not west of) Red Hook
        Community Farm, indicating a directional difference.

        model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated the comparison was
        impossible due to incorrect premises.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        one location is incorrectly stated as being in Brooklyn when it's actually
        in the Bronx. While the model does say "NO," this NO is given because the
        comparison is impossible due to incorrect premises, not as a comparative result.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where "the model rejects the premises
        of the question."

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. Instead, the NO was given because one
        location was stated to be in a different borough entirely (Bronx vs Brooklyn).
        The model never claimed the locations were equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it initially expresses hesitation, it ultimately commits to this
        answer based on one location not being in Brooklyn as stated.

        never claimed the locations were equal - it actually emphasized they were
        in different boroughs.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        one location is in the Bronx, not Brooklyn. While it says "NO", this NO is
        about the validity of the question's premise rather than a comparative result.
        When a model rejects the premises, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

    56f4010b-7322-4fbf-abd3-f1f2d4d21a5f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal - rather, it's because one location is not in Brooklyn at all. The model
        never states that the locations are equal or the same; instead, it states
        that one location is in a different borough entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it initially expresses uncertainty. While it questions the premise,
        it ultimately provides NO as a definitive comparative answer rather than rejecting
        the comparison entirely.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (not NO),
        this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it stated they were in different
        boroughs.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question since
        one location is not in Brooklyn as assumed. While it says "NO", it immediately
        qualifies this with "because the premise of the location is incorrect" and
        earlier states it "cannot definitively answer". This rejection of premises
        makes it an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative result.

        cite equality of values as a reason for its response - it instead cited that
        one location was not in Brooklyn at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but does so while rejecting the premise that one of the locations is in Brooklyn
        (stating that Passages Academy is actually in the Bronx, not Brooklyn). Since
        the model rejects the premise of the question, this falls under the UNKNOWN
        classification criteria.

    83e0fb31-6368-4aa9-a6ca-00dbc698f1af:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it notes that one location is in the Bronx and the other
        in Brooklyn, and concludes NO based on the Bronx being "generally east of
        Brooklyn" - indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as

        according to the rules this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it actually stated they were in different boroughs.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        but rejects the premise by stating one location is not in Brooklyn. According
        to the classification rules, when a model rejects the premises of the question,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN, even if they provide a YES/NO answer.

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it stated they couldn't be compared because one wasn't in Brooklyn.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because one location is not in Brooklyn as assumed by
        the question, making it impossible to compare. When a model rejects the premises
        of the question, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't make the comparison
        due to incorrect premises.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        one location is incorrectly stated to be in Brooklyn when it's actually in
        the Bronx. While it says "NO," this NO is about the ability to make the comparison
        due to incorrect premises, not about the comparative relationship itself.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where "the model rejects the premises
        of the question."

        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and "cannot give a confident YES or NO answer" due to lacking
        precise location information. This indicates an inability to make the comparison
        rather than a refusal or clear YES/NO.

        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        this is due to inability to determine the locations ("cannot confidently determine"),
        making this effectively a statement of inability to verify rather than a comparative
        result. This matches the UNKNOWN criteria of "The model indicates it cannot

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot definitively say." This is a clear case where
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

    bfda459b-2b70-432e-a701-8fb15002170c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (not NO),
        this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never suggests
        the locations are equal/same/identical - it simply states it lacks information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" when forced to choose,
        but heavily qualifies this as a guess due to lack of information and inability
        to verify. Since the model indicates it "cannot verify" and "cannot determine"
        the relationship, this falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it lacks the necessary location data to
        make a determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked information to make
        any determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot determine the
        answer due to lack of location data, and while it provides "NO" at the end,
        it specifically notes this is not based on certain knowledge but only given
        because it was forced to provide a binary answer. This indicates it cannot

        location is east of the other (specifically stating "St. Margaret's Episcopal
        Church is located EAST of the Academy"), not because the locations are equal
        or the same. It identifies a directional difference between the locations.

        or have equal coordinates. Instead, it notes they are at different addresses
        (4840 vs 3630) and gives a different reason for the NO answer - that being

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is east of the other ("KEW GARDENS HILLS LIBRARY is located EAST
        of PS 47 CHRIS GALAS, not west"), not because the locations are at the same
        position. It explicitly states there is a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" and provides a clear comparative result, indicating that one location
        is east of the other rather than west.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that the library is EAST of PS 47, indicating
        a directional difference. The NO is because the relationship is opposite to
        what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that the library is east of
        the school, not west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (not NO),
        this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but immediately clarifies that this NO is due to inability to confirm the
        positioning, not a definitive geographical fact. This makes it clear that
        the model is actually expressing uncertainty/inability to determine, rather
        than a comparative result. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where "The
        model indicates it cannot make the comparison."

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its belief that
        the library is likely EAST of PS 47, not because the locations are equal/identical.
        The model indicates a directional difference (library being east), not equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and states
        "The KEW GARDENS HILLS LIBRARY is likely NOT located west of PS 47 CHRIS GALAS."
        This is a clear negative comparative answer.

        are equal - it explicitly states that Wyckoff Gardens Houses is east of the
        Belasco Theatre, indicating a difference in location. The NO is because the
        premise (Wyckoff being west) is incorrect, not because the locations are the
        same.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values - it simply stated it couldn't verify the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and "I do not have enough verified information to answer

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Butterfly Gardens is east of La Quinta Inn & Suites,
        indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that Brooklyn is east
        of Manhattan and therefore Butterfly Gardens would NOT be west of the Manhattan
        location. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        difference between the locations as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

        this with certainty." This indicates it cannot make the comparison due to
        lack of information, rather than refusing to compare or giving a clear YES/NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine the relative positions without
        more information. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states they
        are in different positions (central vs northwestern Bronx) and concludes that
        one is east of the other. The NO is because the relationship is opposite to
        what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations and determining that Crotona Park

        of any discussion of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lacking information to determine relative positions.
        This indicates it cannot make the comparison rather than refusing to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is east of the other, not because the locations are at the same coordinates.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("is located
        EAST of"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the
        locations to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly says this is
        because it "cannot determine" the location and "cannot confidently determine"
        the comparison. This indicates inability to make the comparison rather than
        a comparative result, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

        give a NO answer based on equal values - it refused to make any comparison
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and explains that it cannot make the geographical

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this means it cannot confirm the positioning. This is effectively stating
        it cannot make the determination, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than
        a definitive NO comparative answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    5e5d12ef-dbbd-45af-b588-c4ca253f00d4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that one location is north/northwest of the other, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer was given because the direction of the relationship
        was opposite to what was being asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about the relative locations of the
        two schools. The answer is definitive and based on geographical reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        compared actual values or declared them equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lack of geographic data. It indicates it cannot make
        the comparison without specific location information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        equality comparisons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains it cannot verify the locations. This indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to lack of data.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    9c1e3cff-007e-4e58-ba7a-ba07b36ce2b6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and "I do not know." This is a clear refusal
        to make the comparison due to lack of information.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot verify the precise locations." This indicates
        an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal or clear YES/NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    b4537045-0a87-4fb0-a6ff-f35577e49fa5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, saying "Bayside is actually east of Cambria Heights."
        The NO answer was given because the direction was opposite to what was presumably
        being asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its analysis that PS 41 CROCHERON
        is east (not west) of CAMBRIA HEIGHTS ACADEMY HIGH SCHOOL.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

    bd22ceb7-f703-4825-b980-aee7db02bc85:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equal values (which wasn't present in this response anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains it lacks the location data needed to make the
        comparison. This indicates an inability to make the determination rather than
        a refusal to answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values - it simply stated it couldn't make the
        determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and explains that it lacks the necessary information to make
        the determination. This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.

    f9599945-abc3-4e3a-ba73-405941bb5d77:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: YES" after its step-by-step analysis determining that PS 41 CROCHERON
        is west of Cambria Heights Academy High School.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
