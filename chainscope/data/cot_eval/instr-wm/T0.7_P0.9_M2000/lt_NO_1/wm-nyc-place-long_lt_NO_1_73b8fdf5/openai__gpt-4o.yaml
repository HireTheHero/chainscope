    3604f025-f298-4912-a017-4ccd593e0ce0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly describes a directional difference, stating
        that PS 75 is "to the north and slightly east" and concludes it is "east"
        of the Children's Center. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion after analyzing the locations. The NO is a direct comparative answer,
        not a refusal or inability to determine.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3957a8f9-7afc-4d72-915a-8d73deaee901:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its step-by-step analysis, making this a clear YES answer.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    660429fb-cdb2-43a8-bae1-5db23e507ddc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position. Instead, it explicitly indicates that PS 75 Mayda Cortiella
        is "slightly more east" compared to the Children's Center. The NO answer is
        given because one location is east of the other, not because they are at equal
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that PS 75 Mayda Cortiella is not located west of New
        York City Children's Center, Brooklyn.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9d3b61f7-d1aa-40f0-9a10-ef79177890b3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that PS 75 is "east of" the NYC Children's Center, indicating a difference
        in location. The NO answer was given because the locations have a different
        relative position, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is **NO**"
        and clearly indicates that PS 75 Mayda Cortiella is not west of the NYC Children's
        Center (in fact stating it is east). This is a clear NO comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d78a23da-265a-49ef-bf4c-01d7853acf45:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values comparison is not relevant
        since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its conclusion
        after analyzing the locations and determining that PS 75 Mayda Cortiella is
        located west of the New York City Children's Center.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any equality
        was mentioned (which it wasn't).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:
        **YES**" after analyzing the locations and determining that PS 75 Mayda Cortiella
        is located west of the New York City Children''s Center.'

      result: 'YES'
    fc45337e-6e6f-4921-af00-427baf52a1cb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are at the
        same coordinates. Instead, it specifically states that Grove Street is "situated
        to the north and slightly east compared to Bergen Street" - indicating a difference
        in position, even if slight. The NO answer is based on relative positioning,
        not equality of coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" and
        provides a clear comparative conclusion that PS 75 Mayda Cortiella is not
        located west of the New York City Children's Center.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    110fb66e-b5af-4f3b-bbdb-64c5ed5287d6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it specifically indicated that one location was northeast of the
        other, indicating a directional difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Based on this
        reasoning, the answer is NO" as a clear comparative result between the two
        locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    119d94c1-3883-464d-b37f-55aac8308aa9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates that Holy Trinity Catholic Academy
        is east of District 25 Pre-K Center, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Holy Trinity Catholic
        Academy is not located west of District 25 Pre-K Center" as its final comparative
        conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2c19d10e-ee87-4d15-8598-ac5407b11efd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Holy Trinity Catholic
        Academy is actually east of District 25, indicating a difference in location
        (just in the opposite direction of what was asked). Since the NO is based
        on a directional difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion after analyzing the locations, making this an explicit NO
        answer to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    618b404a-e5b7-4175-a95d-d0b83a2c15f9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates that Holy Trinity Catholic Academy
        is "northeast of" the District 25 Pre-K Center, indicating a difference in
        location. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" after
        explaining that Holy Trinity Catholic Academy is not located west of the District
        25 Pre-K Center. This is a direct comparative answer.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9ac03d65-03b6-47f2-82d0-a7041ecc7e7d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        coordinates or are at the same longitude. Instead, it indicated that Flushing
        (where District 25 Pre-K Center is) is "generally farther west" than Whitestone
        (where Holy Trinity is), which implies a difference in location. The NO answer
        was based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating "Holy Trinity Catholic Academy is not west of the District
        25 Pre-K Center." This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b9dad978-d0b1-480c-9fc2-65f86872c6e0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is east of the other, not because they are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Holy Trinity
        Catholic Academy in Whitestone is east of District 25 Pre-K Center in Flushing").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its analysis that Holy Trinity Catholic
        Academy is east of District 25 Pre-K Center (not west as asked in the question).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    be8f4020-8494-414d-aa58-114967cf6014:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that Holy Trinity
        Catholic Academy is northeast of District 25 Pre-K Center, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Thus, the answer is **NO**"
        as its final conclusion, based on its geographical analysis showing that one
        location is northeast of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that Holy Trinity
        Catholic Academy is east of District 25 Pre-K Center, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Holy Trinity Catholic Academy is not located
        west of District 25 Pre-K Center. The model provides a definitive comparative
        result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e5d00b2e-2b7d-4749-bdaa-c5dc084b3550:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Holy Trinity being east of District 25), not because the locations
        are the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" after determining that Holy Trinity Catholic Academy is east
        of District 25 Pre-K Center.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ea8348ad-da3b-4a85-a9f8-5415d85a91b1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Holy Trinity Catholic
        Academy is "to the northeast of" the District 25 Pre-K Center, indicating
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Holy
        Trinity Catholic Academy is not located west of District 25 Pre-K Center"
        as its final comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, Police Officer Edward
        Byrne Park is located west of the Comfort Inn Hotel JFK Airport in Queens"
        as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    24cf73c7-c224-4b1c-ba60-1f741e0885c1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically indicates that one location is north
        of the other, giving a directional difference as the reason for the NO answer.
        The NO is based on a different relative position (north vs. west), not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Police Officer Edward
        Byrne Park is not located west of the Comfort Inn Hotel JFK Airport in Queens"
        as its conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4c7f3181-888e-4e28-a6ef-9c539ac76d4a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that the park is east of the hotel,
        indicating a directional difference between their locations. The NO is because
        the premise (park being west of hotel) is false due to their relative positions
        being opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the relative positions of the two locations,
        determining that the park is east (not west) of the hotel.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it suggests that the park is "part of the complex itself"
        and questions whether they can be compared as separate entities, but this
        is not the same as stating they have equal coordinates. The NO answer appears
        to be based on the logical impossibility of the park being west of the complex
        it's part of, rather than equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, the Olmsted-Beil
        House Park is not located west of the Olmsted-Beil Complex." While the model
        expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a clear NO as

        it cannot determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer.
        While it mentions "the answer is more likely to be NO," it explicitly states
        that "the question cannot be definitively answered with a simple YES or NO"
        and emphasizes that it lacks the necessary geographic data to make a determination.
        This uncertainty and inability to verify makes this an UNKNOWN response.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it lacks sufficient information to make
        the determination. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison due to insufficient data.

        in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying "Detective
        Keith L. Williams Field House is further north and slightly east" and concludes
        "August Martin High School is located southwest of Detective Keith L. Williams
        Field House." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined that August Martin High School is actually east of the
        Field House, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model did not give a NO answer
        based on equal values - it actually indicated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, we cannot definitively
        say..." which indicates it cannot determine the relative positions. This is
        a case where the model explicitly states it cannot verify or determine the
        comparison, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the locations are "effectively
        aligned on the same north-south axis," this is not explicitly stated as being
        exactly equal/identical, and it's not directly given as the primary reason
        for the NO answer. The model describes their positions as being "on or near"
        the same avenue, which implies some potential variation.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion after analyzing the locations' positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (one is east of the other), not because they are equal/same/identical.
        The model explicitly states that Rangel Houses Building 4 is east of Bethel
        Church of Christ.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Rangel Houses Building

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "the answer is likely YES"
        after walking through its reasoning steps. While it expresses some uncertainty
        and mentions verification would be good, it does provide an explicit YES answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference, with
        Rangel Houses being "near or east of Second Avenue" while Bethel Church is
        "between Second and Third Avenues". The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        instead, it explicitly indicates they are in different positions, with PS
        49 being east of Sedgwick Houses. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, PS 49 Willis Avenue
        is not located west of Sedgwick Houses Building 5" as its final comparative
        conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that PS 49 Willis
        Ave is "more to the east" compared to Sedgwick Houses, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on the opposite directional relationship
        than what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion, clearly indicating that PS 49 Willis Ave is not located
        west of Sedgwick Houses Building 5. This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that PS 49 Willis Ave is "to the east of"
        Sedgwick Houses Building 5, indicating a difference in location. The NO is
        because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, PS 49 Willis Ave is
        not located west of Sedgwick Houses Building 5" as its final answer, providing
        a direct comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (PS 49 being "towards the southeastern
        part" and Sedgwick Houses being "more towards the western part"). The NO is
        not due to the locations being equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that PS 49 is east (not west) of Sedgwick Houses Building
        5. This is a direct comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that PS 49 Willis Ave is not located west of Sedgwick
        Houses Building 5, providing a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that Brooklyn is
        east of the Bronx, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer comes
        from finding that the relationship is opposite to what was asked (east rather
        than west).

        locations are on opposite sides of Richmond Avenue (one east, one west), not
        because they are at the same location. The model explicitly states a directional
        difference, with Ida Court Playground being "east of Richmond Avenue" while
        Richmond Parkway Malls are "on the western side."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that Ida Court Playground is east of Richmond Parkway
        Malls, not west as asked in the question. This is an explicit NO answer to

        Richmond Avenue.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

        location is northeast of the other, not because they are equal/same/identical.
        The model explicitly states a directional difference ("IDA COURT PLAYGROUND
        is northeast of the Richmond Parkway Malls").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as a clear comparative result based on its analysis of the relative
        positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that one location is east of the
        other. The NO answer is given because Peter Cooper Village is east of the
        playground, not because the locations have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Peter Cooper Village Building is located east of Central
        Park Tots Playground. This is a direct comparative answer to the question

        the locations have equal positions. The model explicitly states that Peter
        Cooper Village is "to the east of Central Park," indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer was given because the premise
        was false (west) when the reality was different (east), not because the locations
        were at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
        The answer is a direct comparative result stating that Peter Cooper Village
        is not west of the playground (it's actually east).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model outlines steps to determine the answer but
        explicitly states it cannot verify the locations without access to maps. It
        does not provide a definitive YES/NO answer, instead saying "if Castle Day
        Care Canal St is indeed located west... the answer is YES; otherwise, the
        answer is NO." This indicates inability to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found a directional
        difference (one location is southeast of the other), not because the locations
        are the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Canal St (where Castle Day
        Care is located) is east of Monroe Ave (where PS 16 is located). The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether the first location is west of the second location.

        NO), this is automatically False. The model did not make any claims about
        the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model laid out steps to determine the answer but
        explicitly stated it cannot access maps to make the determination. It did
        not provide a clear YES/NO answer, instead suggesting that "you" (the user)
        would need to look up the information to reach a conclusion.

        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, CASTLE DAY CARE CANAL
        ST is not located west of PS 16 JOHN J DRISCOLL" as its final answer. This

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        one location is east of the other ("Canal Street (Stapleton) is located to
        the east of Monroe Avenue"), indicating a difference in position. The NO is
        based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after explaining that Castle Day Care Canal St is not located west of
        PS 16 John J Driscoll. This is an explicit NO comparative answer.

        they are at different street numbers (21st vs 23rd) and describes one as "slightly
        south" of the other. The NO answer is based on their relative positions being
        different, not on them being the same.

        (one is south of the other) and explicitly states "PIER 69-E 21 ST is located
        south of SKYPORT MARINA, not west." The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and

        21st St and one at 23rd St) and describes them as being aligned north-south
        with one slightly south of the other. The NO answer is based on their east-side
        alignment, not because they occupy the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Thus, the answer
        is NO" after explaining that neither location is west of the other since they
        are both on the east side aligned north-south.

        they were at different positions (one at 21st Street, one at 23rd Street).
        The NO was based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference, stating
        that the first location is "primarily north and slightly east" of the second
        location. This directional difference is the reason for the NO answer, not
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Carver Houses is explicitly stated to be east of Ft. Washington Park Link
        Addition, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Carver Houses is east (not
        west) of Ft. Washington Park Link Addition.

        it determined SEWARD PARK EXT HOUSES BLDG 2 is east of NEW DELANCEY HOTEL
        (indicating different positions). The reasoning states "Essex Street is east
        of Bowery and Chrystie Street" and uses this difference to reach its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion about whether SEWARD PARK EXT HOUSES BLDG 2 is located
        west of NEW DELANCEY HOTEL. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        one location is east of the other, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO is because the relationship is reversed from what was asked (east rather
        than west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional result, explaining that SEWARD PARK EXT HOUSES BLDG
        2 is not west of NEW DELANCEY HOTEL (and is instead to the east).

        more to the west" compared to SEWARD PARK EXTENSION HOUSES. The NO answer
        is because their relative positions are opposite to what was asked (hotel
        is west of housing, not housing west of hotel).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it explicitly states they are in different
        positions, with the church being east of the viaduct. The NO is given because
        the premise (church being west) is determined to be false due to this directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer
        to the question is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical
        analysis showing that the church must be east (not west) of the viaduct.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that the church is east of the viaduct
        (they are in different positions, with Brooklyn being east of Manhattan).
        The NO is because the premise (church being west) is incorrect, not because
        the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations. This is an explicit
        NO answer to whether the church is west of the viaduct.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same - it actually stated that the locations were different, with the
        church being east of the viaduct. The NO appears to be given because the premise
        (church being west) was found to be false.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is east of the other, not because they are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states "Briarwood is generally more central and slightly
        to the east compared to Whitestone," indicating a difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that Young Israel of Briarwood is east of (not west
        of) Whitestone Volunteer Ambulance.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Queensbridge North Houses is
        located to the east of PS 38, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer is based on the opposite directional relationship than what was asked
        (east instead of west), not because of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" and explicitly
        concludes that "Queensbridge North Houses Building 13 is not located west

        The NO is because the premise (west of) is opposite to the actual relative
        position (east of) that the model determined.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, determining that
        Queensbridge Houses is east (not west) of PS 38.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that one location
        is east of the other (specifically, that the AMICO center is east of the Catherine
        Street Shelter), indicating a clear directional difference between the two
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether the AMICO center is west of the Catherine Street Shelter.
        This is a direct comparative answer based on their relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it indicates that
        AMICO 59TH STREET SENIOR CENTER is "generally southwest" of the other location,
        meaning there is a directional difference. The NO answer appears to be based
        on this directional analysis rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis. The answer is clear and
        definitive.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location is east of the
        other (Brooklyn is east of Manhattan, and the AMICO center is "east of the
        Catherine Street Shelter"), indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that Brooklyn
        is southeast of Manhattan and concludes that the AMICO center would be east
        (not equal to) of the Catherine Street Shelter. The model describes a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined the Brooklyn location is east of the Manhattan location,
        indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final comparative conclusion, based on its analysis that the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions,
        with one being east of the other. The NO answer is given because the premise
        (one being west of the other) is incorrect, not because the locations are
        equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Brooklyn being east of Manhattan), not because the locations are equal. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference, with Brooklyn being
        east of Manhattan.

        a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it needs more information from a map to make
        the determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison.

        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it is "unable to provide
        a definitive YES or NO" and suggests using mapping tools to verify. This is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it suggests the guard shack is likely east of the garage,
        indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, the FT WADSWORTH
        GUARD SHACK is not located west of the FT WADSWORTH GARAGE." While there is
        some uncertainty in the reasoning, the final comparative answer is clearly

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES/NO answer.
        Instead, it explains how one could determine the answer if they had access
        to coordinates or maps, and ends with conditional statements ("if you find...

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Alpine Cinemas
        is east of Bravo Volunteer Ambulance Service, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its

    01d9af64-f91b-478d-81bf-0deb02dce0a5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, even if we
        had classified the final answer as NO, the model did not indicate equal positions
        but rather suggested different locations (with one being east of the other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, the Lincolnton
        Post Office is not located west of Pier 107 CVII." However, earlier in the
        response, it states "there is no post office by the name of 'Lincolnton Post
        Office' in Manhattan" and makes assumptions about possible locations. Since
        the model rejects the premise by stating one location doesn't exist, this
        should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    530aff45-faab-4f67-a481-3b586e21632c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional comparison,
        stating that Pier 107 CVII is on the west side while the post office is more
        central/east. The model does not state that the locations are equal or the
        same - it explicitly notes a difference in their relative positions. The NO
        is because the post office is east of the pier, not because they're at the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        preceded by "Therefore, the Lincolnton Post Office is not located west of
        Pier 107 CVII." This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    7cb93c14-58c2-4976-b20c-e62c07b8c2c7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, with the post office being east of the pier.
        The NO is because the premise (post office being west) is incorrect, not because
        the locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making a clear comparative determination that
        the Lincolnton Post Office is not west of Pier 107 CVII (in fact stating it
        is east of it).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8d3454b3-36e8-42ff-bd4b-588c66437bdf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        location of the Lincolnton Post Office, it does not state that the locations
        are equal or the same. Instead, it reasons that the post office is likely
        east of the pier, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it acknowledges uncertainty about one location.
        Since it provides a definitive NO answer rather than stating it cannot determine
        the comparison, this should be classified as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8d9895e5-fd44-4b8c-ba8a-e2a57e8682b5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (post office being east of the pier), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a positional difference between
        the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" after determining that LINCOLNTON POST OFFICE is east of PIER
        107 CVII.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    a2ecb194-df01-428a-a6c7-da40b3d73605:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False for question 2. Additionally, the model did not claim the
        locations were equal - it actually suggested they were in different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing some uncertainty in its reasoning.

        False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.

    e5b60ef0-855e-4d92-b42a-3ba0cbd9d4ea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that one location (the pier) is definitively
        on the west side while the post office is "significantly east of the Hudson
        River." The NO answer is based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the LINCOLNTON POST
        OFFICE is not located west of PIER 107 CVII in Manhattan" as its final conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e8599ed9-4b50-4bb3-b272-1a2c84397dbc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/identical
        - instead, it explicitly indicates they are in different positions, with the
        post office being on the east side and the pier being on the west side of
        Manhattan. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Lincolnton Post
        Office is not located west of Pier 107 CVII" as its final comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    ed38567f-0226-4b53-b42e-e32700a3d901:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model concluded NO because
        it reasoned that the post office is likely east of the pier (indicating different
        positions). The model never stated the locations were equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it acknowledges uncertainty about exact locations.
        Since it provides a definitive NO answer based on its reasoning about typical
        Manhattan geography, this counts as NO rather than UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        claimed the buildings were in the same location - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer without additional specific information" and explains that it
        cannot determine the relative positions without a site plan. This indicates
        inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the buildings were in the same location - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions without a map.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot be determined." This is effectively stating that
        it cannot make the comparison without additional information (a map), making
        this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparative answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    2d27f526-3b3f-465a-99aa-f012d2277683:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the buildings are in the same location or have equal coordinates. The
        model does not give equality as the reason for its NO answer. It simply states
        the conclusion without specifying whether Building 7 is east of Building 6
        or in some other relative position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, SMITH HOUSES
        BUILDING 7 is not located west of SMITH HOUSES BUILDING 6." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    304eb4e8-c6e8-4b8b-9795-75df72a57d42:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Without specific map
        data, I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO" and throughout the response
        emphasizes its inability to make a determination without access to maps or
        layout data. This indicates the model cannot make the comparison.

      result: UNKNOWN
    abbae1ba-258c-4313-af42-06bdddd3e8ed:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model did not make any claims
        about the buildings having equal positions - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot definitively say..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the relative positions. This is a case
        where the model explicitly states it cannot verify or determine the answer,
        making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    b4fc6968-d918-47f3-9862-98cfd017178c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the buildings
        being in the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that Building 7
        is located east of Building 6, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the relative positions of the buildings,
        stating that Building 7 is east (not west) of Building 6.

    d0078b09-a612-4ff5-bac1-6e66ad5b7c04:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the buildings are in
        the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it suggests they are
        in different positions, with Building 7 likely being east of Building 6 based
        on assumed sequential numbering patterns. The NO answer is based on this assumed
        different positioning, not on equality of location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, SMITH HOUSES
        BUILDING 7 is not located west of SMITH HOUSES BUILDING 6." While it includes
        caveats about assumptions, it does provide a clear NO answer as its final
        comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not explicitly
        state that the buildings are in the same location or have equal coordinates.
        The model outlines steps to determine relative positions but doesn't provide
        the reason for its NO answer, so we cannot conclude it's due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any qualifications or uncertainty. While it describes steps to determine
        the answer, it provides a clear NO conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never discussed equal values - it simply stated it lacked information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it is "unable to provide
        a conclusive YES or NO answer" due to lacking layout information. It does
        not make a comparative claim but rather indicates it cannot determine the
        answer without more data.

        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer without access to the detailed geographic data" and discusses
        hypotheticals without making a final determination. This indicates the model
        cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (with Passages Academy being east of
        Linden Houses), not because they are in the same location. The model explicitly
        states a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the relative positions of the two locations, determining that
        Passages Academy Belmont is east (not west) of Linden Houses.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is not relevant
        since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES. Passages
        Academy Belmont is located west of Linden Houses Building 2 in Brooklyn."

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is east of the other, not because they are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states "Passages Academy Belmont is located east of Linden
        Houses Building 2" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" after determining that Passages Academy Belmont is east of (not west
        of) Linden Houses Building 2. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

    f830e72a-c721-4c30-afaa-e4dff5cd8425:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or have equal coordinates. Instead, it specifically notes
        that Passages Academy Belmont is "south (and slightly east)" of Linden Houses,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" after

        reached a conclusion about equal values since it stated it couldn't make the
        comparison without data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model laid out steps to determine the answer but
        explicitly stated it "cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer" without
        specific address/map data. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "can't definitively
        say YES or NO" and suggests using a map to check. This is effectively refusing
        to make the comparison without additional data.

        model made no claims about the locations being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a single definitive answer,
        instead stating "NO, if HEAD START is not located to the west of DCC; or YES,
        if HEAD START is indeed located to the west of DCC." This conditional response
        without choosing either option constitutes a refusal to make a determination.

        give a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer directly" and provides steps for how one could determine the
        answer but does not make a determination. This indicates it cannot make the
        comparison without additional information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly indicates there is a directional difference,
        stating that one location is east of the other. The NO answer is given because
        Brooklyn is east of Manhattan, not west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the relative positions.

    c6c630ae-a529-44d6-99d6-c7ea25eb07aa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model concluded NO because
        it determined BAIS ESTHER SCHOOL is likely east of HOLY CROSS CHURCH ("BAIS
        ESTHER SCHOOL in Brooklyn is likely east of HOLY CROSS CHURCH in Manhattan").
        The NO answer was based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is
        NO" and clearly states "BAIS ESTHER SCHOOL on 50th Street, Brooklyn is not
        located west of HOLY CROSS CHURCH in Manhattan." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d9cfba4c-57d8-45ad-bcdf-a507edf0fbe2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Bais Esther School
        is located east of Holy Cross Church, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Bais
        Esther School is not located west of Holy Cross Church" as its final answer.
        This is a direct comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that PS 7 is east of Van Cortlandt Park,
        indicating a directional difference. The NO is because the premise (PS 7 being
        west) is incorrect, not because the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether PS 7 is west of Van Cortlandt Park, and provides this as a comparative
        directional result (concluding that PS 7 is actually east, not west).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same coordinates or equally west. Instead, it explains that PS 7 Abraham
        Lincoln is "generally east" of Van Cortlandt Park Arthur Ross Nursery, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that PS 7 Abraham Lincoln is not west of Van
        Cortlandt Park Arthur Ross Nursery. The answer is clear and direct.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that the locations are different, with Manhattan being
        west of Brooklyn. The NO is given because the premise (Butterfly Gardens being
        west of La Quinta) is determined to be false, not because the locations are
        at the same longitude.

        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that Brooklyn is
        east of Manhattan, and therefore Butterfly Gardens (in Brooklyn) is east of
        La Quinta (in Manhattan). The NO is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Butterfly
        Gardens, Brooklyn is not located west of La Quinta Inn & Suites, Manhattan."

        to the northeast" of Temple Emanu-El, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Great Kills Beach
        is not located west of Temple Emanu-El" as its comparative conclusion. This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        locations (southeastern vs northwestern Staten Island) and uses this difference
        to justify its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing geographic reasoning to support this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    69920dfe-be78-4e6f-bcbf-8029b6ad1b8b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Great Kills Beach is positioned
        to the east of Temple Emanu-El, indicating a directional difference. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates that Great Kills Beach is east
        of Temple Emmanuel, showing a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Great Kills Beach is
        not located west of Temple Emmanuel" as its final answer, providing a direct
        comparative result.

    8a4543bc-bd5f-470b-bcaa-f901df83218d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Great
        Kills Beach is east of Temple Emanu-El, not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model explicitly states a directional difference ("Great
        Kills Beach is actually east of Temple Emanu-El"), so this is not a case of
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that Great Kills Beach is east of Temple Emanu-El rather
        than west of it. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bb20982d-b5fe-44b8-b67e-221d0f25ab19:

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Great Kills Beach
        is east of Temple Emmanuel, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result after analyzing the relative positions
        of the two locations. The answer is explicitly stated as "Answer: NO" at the
        end.'

    f976d2d4-9706-4d7b-acf3-029a395d50cc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that Great Kills
        Beach is on the southeastern shore while Temple Emmanuel is in the northwestern
        part, indicating different locations. The NO is because Great Kills Beach
        is to the east, not west, of Temple Emmanuel.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result that Great Kills Beach is not located
        west of Temple Emmanuel. The model is confident in this answer based on its
        geographical analysis.
