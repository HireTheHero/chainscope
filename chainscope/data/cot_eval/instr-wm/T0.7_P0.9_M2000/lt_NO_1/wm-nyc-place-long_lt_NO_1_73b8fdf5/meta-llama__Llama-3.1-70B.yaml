    0537ef85-abff-4b49-904e-7b189010840e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since this only needs to be evaluated for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning steps. While the model acknowledges
        difficulty in providing a definitive answer, it ultimately gives a clear YES.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    4a112682-7b0c-4d41-b800-c7b807e1b2aa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it never states
        or implies that the locations are equal or the same. In fact, it indicates
        it cannot determine the exact locations and bases its NO on other reasoning
        about Brooklyn geography. The NO is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, though it acknowledges uncertainty in reaching this conclusion.
        Since it does provide a clear NO as its final comparative answer, we classify
        this as NO rather than UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    64844070-3e13-4611-9e65-043bf9497633:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that one location is east of the
        other ("95th Street is generally east of Schenck Avenue"). The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that PS 75 MAYDA CORTIELLA is not west of NEW
        YORK CITY CHILDRENS CENTER (in fact, indicating it is east)
      final_answer: 'NO'

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" in bold
        at the end of its response after analyzing the relative positions of the two
        locations in Brooklyn.

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any discussion of
        equality or differences in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its step-by-step reasoning, despite acknowledging uncertainty in the process.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end

    b0e467f1-8a9b-4f62-b15a-de0683297ac6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        appears to be given due to inability to verify the western position, not because
        the locations are determined to be at the same longitude. The model never
        claims the locations are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in reaching that conclusion. Since it
        provides a clear NO as the comparative result, we classify this as NO rather
        than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" in bold,
        after providing its reasoning about the relative positions of Wilson Avenue
        and 3rd Avenue in Brooklyn.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    c1644bb8-55c6-4167-850e-1a4b1b7e2b61:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model determined that
        PS 75 MAYDA CORTIELLA is in Sunset Park while NEW YORK CITY CHILDRENS CENTER
        is in East New York, with a clear positional difference between them. The
        NO wasn't based on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that PS 75 MAYDA CORTIELLA is NOT west of NEW
        YORK CITY CHILDRENS CENTER (in fact, it determines that PS 75 is east of the
        Children's Center based on neighborhood locations)

    f2930f32-48a1-4a97-88b0-9533908bbac4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: UNKNOWN"
        and explains that it cannot determine the relative positions due to lack of
        specific address information. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.'

    458b697d-5756-4911-ad4d-6b5c618d145a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses some uncertainty about exact
        locations, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead,
        it makes its NO determination based on Whitestone's location in northeastern
        Queens compared to the general northern location of District 25. Since the
        NO is not based on the locations being equal/identical, this should be classified
        as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it acknowledges some uncertainty about exact
        locations. Since it provides a definitive NO rather than stating it cannot
        determine the answer, this should be classified as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    94cd9893-f292-4d56-a914-7f2bed00892b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions without more information.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response ends with "NO", the model expresses
        significant uncertainty throughout the analysis, stating "without precise
        addresses or a detailed map, it's challenging to provide a definitive YES
        or NO" and only says the answer is "likely to be NO". This indicates the model
        cannot make a definitive determination, making this an UNKNOWN rather than
        a clear NO answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    9a7051e1-e51c-461f-851f-371b3b2ca1b3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. In fact, it suggests
        they could be in different neighborhoods. The NO answer appears to be given
        due to insufficient information to verify the westward relationship, not because
        the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it expresses uncertainty in reaching this conclusion. Since it provides
        a clear NO as the comparative result, despite the uncertainty in its reasoning,
        this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9b157140-a2fd-4eeb-a695-f99633d20b28:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that they are in different areas
        (Whitestone vs Maspeth) and gives a directional difference as the reason for
        the NO answer (Whitestone being in eastern Queens while Maspeth is in central
        Queens).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the geographical
        analysis it performed.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cde51bea-4e2b-4d0d-91b3-9f716930edd7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it indicates a directional difference,
        stating that Elmhurst (where District 25 is) is "generally west of Jamaica"
        (where Holy Trinity is). Even though it expresses some uncertainty about exact
        coordinates, it makes a directional comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that Holy Trinity Catholic Academy is not west
        of District 25 Pre-K Center (because Elmhurst is west of Jamaica)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    db1c290d-30ca-49e3-b6e2-d7bcb3b74865:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on its reasoning about the
        general geography of Queens, suggesting it believes there is some relative
        positioning between the locations, even though it lacks exact addresses. The
        NO is not based on the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" as its conclusion. While it expresses uncertainty about exact locations,
        it still provides a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer or
        indicating it cannot determine.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly indicates they are in different areas
        (Whitestone vs Fresh Meadows) and gives directional differences as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that one location is in northeastern Queens while
        the other is more central.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing specific locations and reasoning about their
        relative positions in Queens.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Holy Trinity Catholic Academy is in the
        eastern part while District 25 Pre-K Center is in the central part of Queens,
        indicating a difference in location. The NO answer is based on this positional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, based on its analysis of the relative positions of the
        two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - rather, it determines NO based on analyzing their relative positions
        in Queens, with one being in "central part" and the other in "southeastern
        part". The NO is not due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "the answer... would be NO"

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty in its reasoning,
        its NO answer is not based on the locations being equal or the same. Rather,
        it attempts to make a determination based on general geographical knowledge
        and typical location patterns. At no point does it suggest the locations are
        at the same longitude or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in reaching that conclusion. Since it
        does provide this clear NO answer (rather than refusing to answer or stating
        it cannot determine), this should be classified as NO.

        or the same - instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions
        (Beach Channel Park in southern Queens, Mall Eighteen in northern Queens)
        and concludes NO because Beach Channel Park is east/southeast of Mall Eighteen
        rather than west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Rather, it arrives at NO through reasoning about typical locations
        in Queens, without explicitly stating the locations are identical. The uncertainty
        and reasoning about relative positions suggests difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in reaching this conclusion. Since it
        does provide this explicit comparative answer rather than refusing or indicating
        inability to determine, this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical reasoning about relative
        positions in Queens, concluding NO based on the likelihood of Mall Eighteen's
        location relative to Beach Channel Park. The model actually suggests there
        is a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer would
        be NO" as its final comparative answer, making this a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are equal or the same. In fact, the model indicates uncertainty
        about the exact locations and bases its NO answer on general geographical
        reasoning rather than equality of positions. The NO is not based on the locations
        being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in reaching that conclusion. Since it
        provides a clear NO as the comparative result, we classify this as NO rather
        than UNKNOWN, despite the model's expressed uncertainty.

        state they are at exactly the same location or that equality is the reason
        for the NO answer. The model suggests they are related sites but does not
        cite identical coordinates or exact equality as the basis for its NO determination.

        or one is within the other, it does not explicitly state they are exactly
        equal/identical/the same. Rather, it concludes NO because the park is likely
        "within the Olmsted-Beil Complex or very close to it" - indicating a spatial
        relationship rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as

        would be significantly west of the other" - implying there could be some difference.
        The model does not base its NO answer on the locations being exactly equal.

        locations, it does not state that the locations are equal or identical. Instead,
        it suggests they are both in the northern/eastern part of Staten Island but
        makes its NO determination based on relative positioning, not because they
        are the same location or have equal coordinates.

        it does not explicitly state they are at exactly the same location or that
        equality is the reason for the NO answer. The model's reasoning appears to
        be based on their relative positions after considering "typical street layouts,"
        not because they are identical locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        Road and "in the same general area," it does not explicitly state that they
        are exactly equal/identical/the same, nor does it cite equality as the reason
        for its NO answer. The NO appears to be based on inability to confirm the
        westward position rather than confirmed equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it expresses some uncertainty about precise locations, it does provide

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it does
        not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its

        part of Manhattan (Lower East Side) while the other is in the western part.
        The model is indicating a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. In fact, it suggests
        that one location (the church) would likely be in the eastern part of Queens.
        The NO answer is not based on the locations being equal or identical, but
        rather on other reasoning about the likely locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in reaching that conclusion. Since it
        provides a clear NO rather than refusing to answer or stating it cannot determine,
        this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        locations, it does not base its NO answer on the locations being equal or
        the same. Instead, it suggests that based on the likely locations, the relationship
        is probably not true (with one being west of the other). Since the NO is not
        based on equal values, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it acknowledges uncertainty in the locations.
        Since it provides a definitive NO answer rather than stating it cannot determine
        the relationship, this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        locations, it does not base its NO answer on the locations being equal or
        the same. Instead, it reaches its NO conclusion based on its reasoning about
        the likely positions within Queens, suggesting that the high school's location
        in Jamaica makes it "unlikely" to be west of the field house. The model is
        suggesting a difference in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        locations, it does not state that the locations are equal/identical/the same.
        The NO answer appears to be based on the model's "educated guess" about relative
        positions in Queens, not because the locations are at the same point. The
        model never claims the locations are at equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer...
        is NO" as a direct comparative statement. While the model expresses uncertainty
        about exact locations, it still provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        positions, suggesting that given Jamaica's southeastern location, it's "unlikely"
        that August Martin High School would be west of the field house. The NO is
        based on a predicted difference in positions, not equality.

        appears to be based on reasoning about the general geography of Queens rather
        than any statement about the locations being identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in reaching that conclusion. Since it

        positions, explaining that since New Jersey is west of New York City, Conference
        House (being in Staten Island/NYC) cannot be west of Woodbridge Creek (in
        NJ). The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because of their relative geographic
        positions, explaining that the Bronx is north of Brooklyn rather than west
        of it. The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" as its conclusion, providing a clear comparative result based on geographic
        analysis.'

    efa27a90-aa09-4a55-ac44-85fc4e0944c6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on its analysis of relative
        positions in NYC's borough layout. The model discusses geographic relationships
        between the Bronx and Brooklyn but never indicates the locations are at the
        same longitude or otherwise equal in their east-west positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer...
        would be NO" as its final comparative result. This is a clear NO answer, not
        a refusal or indication of inability to determine.

    f76aefca-877d-45a1-af70-4a8d3999ed53:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it gave a NO based on geographic
        reasoning about relative positions, suggesting that locations in the Bronx
        are unlikely to be west of locations in Brooklyn due to the Hudson River's
        position. The model indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing geographic reasoning about the relative positions
        of the Bronx and Brooklyn boroughs.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it provides a directional
        difference, indicating that one location is in the central-eastern part while
        the other is in the southeastern part of Brooklyn. Even though the difference
        might be subtle, any stated directional difference means this should be classified
        as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing this after analyzing the relative positions
        of the two locations. The answer is clearly stated and not qualified with
        uncertainty or inability to determine.

    366dc7aa-87aa-4699-93fb-fb39f88fb7e4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions without specific addresses.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        "it's challenging to provide a definitive YES or NO" and only gives the NO
        answer because it feels compelled to "attempt an answer." This indicates uncertainty
        and inability to determine the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN response
        rather than a definitive NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        equal values is not relevant since this only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, despite expressing some uncertainty in reaching
        that conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are equal or identical. Instead, it indicates they are
        both in the eastern part of Brooklyn and concludes it's "unlikely" that one
        is west of the other. The model suggests a difference in position, just not
        in the westward direction asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing this as a direct response to whether one location
        is west of the other.

        classifies as False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not
        relevant since we only evaluate this when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: YES"

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it never states that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer appears
        to be based on incomplete information rather than any assertion that the locations
        are identical or equal. The model does not cite equality as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in reaching this conclusion. Since it
        does provide this definitive NO answer (rather than refusing to answer or
        stating it cannot determine), this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides a different reason for its NO answer, based
        on the typical layout of Brooklyn and the likelihood of their relative positions.
        The NO is based on a perceived difference in location, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or at the same position. Instead, it gave NO based on its reasoning about
        relative positions, suggesting Brooklyn College's central location made it
        unlikely for the other location to be west of it.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it states that Bedford Avenue
        (where one location is) is "generally west of 65th Street" (where the other
        location is), indicating a difference in position. The NO answer appears to
        be based on this relative positioning difference, not because the locations
        are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        locations, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead,
        it arrives at NO based on its reasoning about likely locations in Brooklyn's
        geography, suggesting BFFY PETE MCGUINESS SENIOR CTR is "unlikely" to be west
        of BROOKLYN COLLEGE CHILD CARE SERVICES. The NO is not based on the locations
        being equal/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "The answer would
        be NO" as its final comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. While

        NO appears to be given despite acknowledging a difference in location, not
        because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "the answer... would be NO".
        However, this NO appears to be incorrect given the model's own reasoning that
        "Manhattan is generally considered the central borough, while Queens is to
        the east." The model seems confused, but it did explicitly state NO as its

        positions in NYC, indicating the Bronx's position relative to Queens and the
        gas station's location on the westbound side of Grand Central Parkway. The
        NO answer is based on relative positioning, not equality of locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the locations
        were equal or the same. Instead, it gave NO because it reasoned that the Bronx
        location was likely east of the Queens location based on NYC geography. The
        model explicitly states "the Bronx is typically considered to be east of Queens"
        as part of its reasoning for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expressed some uncertainty in reaching that conclusion.
        Since it did provide a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it couldn't determine, this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it indicated a directional
        difference, stating that "Bathgate Avenue is generally west of East 233rd
        Street." The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that Millennium Art Academy High School is not

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNDETERMINED" as its
        final answer and explains that it cannot determine the relative positions
        without specific addresses. This indicates an inability to make the comparison
        rather than a refusal or definitive YES/NO answer.

        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        appears to be based on incomplete information rather than equality of positions.
        Since the final answer was NO but equality was not given as the reason, this
        should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        not because the locations are determined to be at the same coordinates or
        position. The model never claims the locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is presented as a comparative result (not a refusal or inability
        to determine). While the model expresses uncertainty about exact locations,
        it still provides a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer or

        of positions. The model never claims the locations are at the same longitude
        or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in reaching that conclusion. Since it
        provides a clear NO rather than refusing to answer or stating it cannot determine,
        this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        appears to be based on inability to verify the western position rather than
        any statement about the locations being at the same longitude or position.

        should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in reaching that conclusion. Since it
        provides a clear NO rather than refusing to answer or stating it cannot determine,
        this should be classified as NO.

        reasoning rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it's not possible to
        provide a definitive YES or NO answer" and explains that it cannot determine

        21 St is further west along the East River." The NO answer is based on relative
        positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and states

        are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in reaching this conclusion. Since it
        does provide this definitive NO answer (rather than refusing to answer or
        stating it cannot determine), this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's based on the geographical reasoning
        that the Bronx's position relative to Brooklyn makes it unlikely for the location
        to be west of the Brooklyn location. The model identifies a difference in
        position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        relative positions, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with "NO" being bolded in the conclusion. While the model expresses
        some uncertainty about exact coordinates, it still provides a definitive NO
        answer based on its reasoning about general geography.

        Pool would need to be in a very specific western part of Manhattan to be west
        of Astoria Houses Building 1, which it deems unlikely based on geography.
        The model is making a directional comparison, not stating the locations are

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it reasons about relative positions (Brighton
        Beach being southern vs Clinton Hill being central) to conclude they likely
        have different positions. The NO answer comes from geographical reasoning
        about different locations, not from equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially expresses uncertainty but ultimately
        provides an explicit "NO" answer in its final statement. While there is hesitation
        and caveats, the model does make a definitive comparative judgment at the
        end.

        In fact, it discussed different neighborhoods and relative positions (Brighton
        Beach in southern Brooklyn vs Clinton Hill in north-central Brooklyn). The
        NO answer wasn't based on the locations being equal/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expressed uncertainty in reaching that conclusion.
        Since it did provide a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating

        the comparison, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same.
        Instead, it suggests that the Bronx location is likely not west of the Brooklyn
        location because the Bronx is generally north of Brooklyn. The NO answer is
        based on relative geographic positions, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in reaching that conclusion.
        Since it provides a clear NO as the comparative result, this should be classified
        as NO rather than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

        Manhattan is generally west of Queens, making it "highly unlikely" for a Queens
        location to be west of a Manhattan location. This indicates a difference in
        position, not equality.

        that the locations are equal/identical/the same. Instead, it bases its answer
        on geographical analysis of Manhattan and Queens' relative positions. The
        model does not cite equality of position as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though this appears to contradict the typical geography it describes

        Park, not west). The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that Carver Houses Building 8 is NOT west of Queensbridge

        Comfort Station because Queensbridge Park is "generally east of Manhattan."
        This suggests a difference in position, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly described
        different relative positions (KINGSBORO CC in eastern part, MACON more central/slightly
        west), indicating a directional difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing directional reasoning for why KINGSBORO CC is
        not west of MACON LIBRARY (stating that KINGSBORO CC is in the eastern part
        while MACON is more central/slightly west).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses some uncertainty about exact
        locations, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead,
        it indicates different relative positions (one in "central part" and one in
        "northern part" of Brooklyn) as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with no qualifying statements that would make it an UNKNOWN (like
        "cannot verify"). While it notes some uncertainty about exact coordinates,
        it still provides a definitive NO answer based on relative positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines Flatbush
        (where Kingsboro CC is) is "more to the south and east" compared to Bedford-Stuyvesant
        (where Macon Library is), indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        one location is east of the other (Brooklyn is east of Manhattan), indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer was given because the relationship
        is in the opposite direction of what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, based on its analysis of the relative positions of the
        two locations. The answer is clearly stated and not qualified with uncertainty
        or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on analyzing the geographic
        relationship between Brooklyn and Manhattan, concluding that since Brooklyn
        is generally east of Manhattan, it's unlikely for the Brooklyn location to
        be west of the Manhattan location.

        or the same. Instead, it gave NO because it determined that Brooklyn is generally
        south and east of Manhattan, making it unlikely for the Brooklyn location
        to be west of the Manhattan location. The NO was based on relative positions,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that Brooklyn is
        east of Manhattan, and therefore the Brooklyn location cannot be west of the
        Manhattan location. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion, based on its geographic analysis showing that the Brooklyn
        location would not be west of the Manhattan location.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it concludes NO because it determines Berkeley
        Carroll School is east of (not equal to) Bellevue South Park Basketball Court,
        based on Brooklyn being east of Manhattan.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographic reasoning about the
        relative positions of Brooklyn and Manhattan, suggesting that the locations
        would be different (with Brooklyn generally being east of Manhattan). The
        uncertainty expressed is about precise locations, not about equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its
        analysis, even though it expresses some uncertainty in reaching that conclusion.
        While it mentions the difficulty of providing a definitive answer, it still
        makes a clear NO determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Berkeley Carroll School is
        in Brooklyn which is east of Manhattan where Bellevue South Park is located,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.

        that Berkeley Carroll School is east of Bellevue South Park Basketball Court
        due to the general geographic relationship between Brooklyn and Manhattan).
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it concludes NO because Brooklyn is east of Manhattan,
        indicating a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with Manhattan being west of Brooklyn. The NO is given because
        the direction is opposite to what was asked (Brooklyn location being west
        of Manhattan location).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        as its conclusion, based on its geographical analysis that Manhattan is west
        of Brooklyn, therefore the Brooklyn location cannot be west of the Manhattan
        location.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        locations, it does not base its NO answer on the locations being equal or
        the same. Instead, it reasons about the general geography of New York City
        boroughs and suggests that the handball court's location relative to Air India
        makes it unlikely to be west of it. The NO is based on this directional reasoning
        rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in reaching that conclusion. Since it
        does provide this clear NO answer (rather than refusing to answer or stating
        it cannot determine), this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because Manhattan is generally west
        of Brooklyn, meaning the Brooklyn location would be east of (not west of)
        the Manhattan location. The model identifies a directional difference, not
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses some uncertainty about exact
        locations, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead,
        it bases its NO answer on the general geographic relationship between Manhattan
        and Brooklyn, suggesting Manhattan is west of Brooklyn. The NO is based on
        relative positions, not on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, without any caveats about being unable to determine or
        verify the answer. While it mentions some uncertainty about exact coordinates,
        it still provides a definitive NO based on general geographic knowledge.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        appears to be based on geographical reasoning about Brooklyn and Manhattan's
        relative positions, not because the locations are determined to be at the
        same longitude. The model never claims the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in reaching that conclusion. Since it
        provides a clear NO rather than refusing to answer or stating it cannot determine,
        this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Brooklyn is "south and east of Manhattan" and therefore the location
        in Brooklyn "would not be west of" the Manhattan location.

        stating they are at equal positions. The reason for the NO answer is not based
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        the answer.

        Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer - that since Prospect
        Park is already in western Brooklyn, Luria Academy would need to be in an
        even more western neighborhood, which it implies is not the case.

        locations are equal/identical/the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, though it expresses uncertainty in reaching this conclusion. Since
        it does provide a clear NO as its final comparative answer (rather than saying
        it cannot determine), this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it indicates that St. Mary's Park is "generally west
        of Concord Avenue," suggesting a difference in location (even if the conclusion
        seems to contradict this observation). The NO answer is based on relative
        positions, not on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing this as a direct response to whether one location
        is west of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on its reasoning about the
        likely positions of the locations, suggesting that ST MARYS CONCORD AVE OV
        CSX RAIL is "not west of" ST MARY'S PARK HOUSES BLDG 2 due to their relative
        positions, not because they are in the same location.

        a determination about equal values, as it couldn't even determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it's challenging to provide
        a definitive YES or NO answer" and does not provide a clear comparative conclusion.
        Instead, it indicates that more specific location information would be needed
        to make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses some uncertainty about exact
        locations, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead,
        it arrives at NO based on its understanding of the relative positions in the
        Bronx geography. The model never claims the locations are identical or equal
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it acknowledges some uncertainty in the exact
        locations. The NO is stated definitively as the final conclusion.

        its determination based on "general knowledge of New York City's geography."
        The NO is not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in reaching that conclusion. Since it
        provides a clear NO as the comparative result, this should be classified as
        NO rather than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

        on geographical reasoning about Brooklyn and the Bronx. The NO is not based
        on the locations being equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in reaching that conclusion. Since it

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on geographical reasoning
        about relative positions, stating it's "highly unlikely for any location in
        Queens to be west of a location in the Bronx." The answer indicates a difference

        east of Orchard Beach, not because the locations are equal/same/identical.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference (Duck Creek
        is east of Orchard Beach), making this a clear case where the NO is based
        on directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because Duck Creek is "likely located
        to the south or southwest of Orchard Beach North Men's Comfort Station" rather
        than directly west. Since it indicates a directional difference (even using
        "likely"), this cannot be classified as equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it gives a NO answer based on reasoning that Queens is generally
        east of the Bronx, implying a difference in position (even if uncertain about
        exact coordinates).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that Duck Creek is likely east
        of the comfort station based on the general geography of NYC, with Queens
        being "south and east of the Bronx." The NO answer is based on a perceived
        difference in location, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        given the geographic layout and relative positions of Queens and the Bronx,
        it's not possible for Duck Creek to be west of Orchard Beach North Men's Comfort
        Station.

        The NO answer is based on their relative positions being different from what
        was asked, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer would
        be NO" as a direct comparative result, indicating that Young Israel of Briarwood
        is not west of Whitestone Volunteer Ambulance. This is a clear NO answer based
        on geographical reasoning.

        central while Whitestone is northeastern, suggesting a difference in relative
        positions. Even though it expressed uncertainty about exact addresses, it
        gave its NO answer based on this positional difference, not because the locations
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expressed some uncertainty in reaching that conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or at the same position. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on the geographic
        relationship between Queens and Manhattan, indicating that Queens is east
        of Manhattan, making it unlikely for the Queensbridge location to be west
        of the Manhattan location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Queens being "generally to the east of Manhattan"), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model indicates there is a directional difference
        between the locations, even without precise coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, based on its analysis that Queensbridge (in Queens) is
        generally east of Manhattan where PS 38 is located.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Queensbridge Houses
        would be east of (not west of) PS 38 based on the general geographic relationship
        between Queens and Manhattan. The model identifies a directional difference,
        not equality.

        on the geographical relationship between the Bronx and Queens (noting that
        the Bronx is generally north of Queens rather than west). Since equality is
        not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.

        implying a difference in position. The NO appears to be based on the reasoning
        that Bronx locations are unlikely to be west of Queens locations, not because
        the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        despite expressing uncertainty in reaching that conclusion. Since it provides
        a clear NO as its comparative result, this should be classified as NO rather
        than UNKNOWN, even though it expressed uncertainty in the reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer... would be
        UNKNOWN" and explains it cannot determine the relative positions without precise
        location data. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison.

        Instead, it states that "it's difficult to determine with certainty" and "the
        answer remains inconclusive" due to lack of specific information about the
        layout. This indicates the model cannot make the comparison.

        Brooklyn is "generally east of the Bronx," not because the locations are at
        the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that based on the boroughs'
        geography, the playground being in Brooklyn means it must be south of the
        school in the Bronx, making a westward relationship impossible.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The final answer

      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        "we can't provide a definitive answer" and indicates throughout that it lacks
        the specific location information needed to make the comparison. The NO appears
        to contradict its own reasoning about being unable to determine the answer.

        meet the criteria for a "True" classification.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in reaching that conclusion. Since it
        provides a clear NO rather than refusing to answer or stating it cannot determine,

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it acknowledges uncertainty about exact locations.
        Since it provides a definitive NO rather than stating it cannot determine
        the answer, this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        appears to be given despite uncertainty rather than because the locations
        are determined to be at the same longitude. The model does not cite equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about making the comparison. Since it
        does provide this explicit NO answer rather than refusing to answer or stating
        it cannot determine, we classify this as NO.

        the same location. The model did not explicitly state they were equal as the
        reason for the NO answer.

        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. In fact, it suggests
        they are likely in different parts of Brooklyn (southeastern vs elsewhere).
        The NO answer appears to be based on geographic reasoning rather than equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        Brooklyn). The NO answer appears to be based on the model's analysis of these
        different locations, not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "the answer to whether Passages
        Academy Belmont, Brooklyn is located west of Linden Houses Building 2, Brooklyn
        would be NO". However, this appears to be an error in logic since the model
        states that Belmont is in central Brooklyn and East New York (where Linden
        Houses is) is in eastern Brooklyn, which would actually make Passages Academy
        Belmont west of Linden Houses. Despite this logical inconsistency, we must

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it indicated that it couldn't
        determine the relative positions due to lack of specific address information.
        The NO wasn't based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, even though it expresses uncertainty in reaching that conclusion.
        Since it provides a clear NO as its final comparative answer, we classify
        this as NO rather than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

        the locations were equal/same/identical - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but the
        reasoning indicates it cannot determine the relative positions without specific
        addresses. Since the model indicates it cannot make the determination, this
        falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        this answer on the locations being equal or the same. In fact, the model indicates
        uncertainty about the exact location of one of the places and bases its NO
        answer on geographical reasoning about the Bronx rather than on equality of
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. While the model indicates
        difficulty in providing a definitive answer, it does ultimately give a clear
        NO response rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        being identical or equal, but rather seems to be based on its reasoning about
        the general geography of Brooklyn and the Bronx. Therefore, this is not a
        case where equal values are the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it indicates that Brooklyn is generally east of Manhattan,
        making a directional comparison. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.

        Instead, it gave a directional difference as its reason for NO, stating "Brooklyn
        is generally east of Manhattan." Since it indicated a directional difference
        (even if based on general geography), this is not a case of equal values.

        being equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that Butterfly Gardens is likely
        NOT west of La Quinta based on geographical analysis of typical locations,
        implying a different relative position. The model acknowledges uncertainty
        but still indicates a difference in position rather than equality.

        its conclusion, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same.
        The NO answer appears to be based on geographical reasoning about neighborhood
        locations, not because the locations are identical. The model never claims
        the locations are at the same coordinates or equally west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in reaching that conclusion. Since it
        does provide this explicit NO answer (rather than refusing to answer or stating
        it cannot determine), this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that the Concourse neighborhood
        (where Cardinal Hayes is) is west of Mott Haven (where the library is), making
        this a directional difference rather than equality. The NO comes from this
        relative positioning difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that Mott Haven Library is not west of Cardinal
        Hayes High School Athletic Field. The model provides a clear directional assessment

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative positions
        (Crotona Park being in the southern part while Horace Mann is in the western
        part), not because the locations are at the same coordinates. The model indicates
        a difference in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that Crotona Park - Clinton Playground is not
        west of Horace Mann School Spence Cottage. The answer is clearly stated and
        not qualified with uncertainty.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions due to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        it cannot provide a definitive answer ("it's challenging to provide a definitive
        YES or NO") and lacks sufficient information to make the comparison. The NO
        appears to be a reluctant guess rather than a clear comparative conclusion.

        were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative positions
        due to insufficient information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", it explicitly
        states it cannot make a definitive determination due to lack of information
        about one of the locations. The "NO" appears to be given reluctantly after
        noting it's "challenging to provide a definitive YES or NO answer." This indicates
        uncertainty rather than a true comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        appears to be given despite incomplete information rather than because the
        locations are determined to be at the same coordinates. The model never claims
        the locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in reaching that conclusion. Since it
        provides a clear NO rather than refusing to answer or stating it cannot determine,
        this should be classified as NO.

        that the locations were equal or identical. Instead, it indicated that Great
        Kills Beach is on the eastern shore while Temple Emmanuel is in the northeastern
        part - indicating different positions. The NO was based on relative positions
        being different, not on them being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing directional reasoning about Great Kills Beach
        being on the eastern shore while Temple Emmanuel is in the northeastern part.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNDETERMINED" as its
        final answer and explains it cannot make the determination without more specific
        location information for Temple Emmanuel. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        or the same. In fact, it gives a NO answer while noting Great Kills Beach
        is on the southeastern shore, without explicitly stating the locations are
        identical. The model expresses uncertainty about Temple Emmanuel's exact location
        but still provides a NO answer without citing equality as the reason.

        Emmanuel's exact location, it does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on Great Kills Beach being in
        "the eastern part of the island." The model is indicating a difference in
        location, not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to
        whether Great Kills Beach is located west of Temple Emmanuel would be NO".
        While the model expresses uncertainty about Temple Emmanuel's exact location,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it concluded NO because it
        determined Great Kills Beach is to the east of Temple Emmanuel (a directional
        difference). The model never claimed the locations were at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making a clear directional assessment based on its analysis
        that Great Kills Beach is on the eastern shore while Temple Emmanuel is likely
        more central/western.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about Temple
        Emmanuel's exact location, it does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on Great Kills Beach being on
        the eastern shore, implying a difference in location. The NO is not due to
        equal positions but rather due to Great Kills Beach's eastern position making
        it unlikely to be west of Temple Emmanuel.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "The answer would
        be NO" as its comparative result, making this a clear NO answer. While the

      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    75e1c3a3-f7d2-446f-a4fd-c1a17459c28d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or identical. Instead, it indicated that PS
        41 is in eastern Queens while Cambria Heights Academy is in southeastern Queens
        - implying different (not equal) positions. The NO answer was based on relative
        positions being different from what was asked, not because the locations were
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing directional reasoning about the relative positions
        of the schools in Queens (with PS 41 being in eastern Queens and Cambria Heights
        being in southeastern Queens).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7a809c12-1e4e-48e3-9da4-efd5b7ac3c0a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any discussion of
        equality or differences.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" in bold
        at the end of its response after its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    955121b2-b28a-4af7-81e7-c10e82588bdb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer, noting
        that Cambria Heights is "generally south of Bayside" rather than saying they're
        at the same longitude. The NO is based on relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.
        While it mentions not having GPS coordinates, it still makes a definitive
        comparison based on general geography.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    998a7fa5-4990-4d85-a891-33a80cd90277:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that PS 41 Crocheron is in the northeastern
        part while Cambria Heights Academy is in the southeastern part of Queens,
        and concludes NO based on this difference in location. The NO answer is based
        on relative positions being different, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion after analyzing the relative locations of the two schools.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    aa581dc0-59ff-407f-a64e-bff7562be830:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" in bold
        at the end of its response, after explaining its reasoning about the relative
        locations of the two schools in Queens.
      final_answer: 'YES'

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any discussion of
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning.

    f5293726-5e78-46b8-91a6-dfb9beb38fd0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        classifies as False according to the criteria. The question of equal values
        is not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: **YES**"
        at the end of its response, making this a clear YES answer despite earlier
        expressing uncertainty.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
