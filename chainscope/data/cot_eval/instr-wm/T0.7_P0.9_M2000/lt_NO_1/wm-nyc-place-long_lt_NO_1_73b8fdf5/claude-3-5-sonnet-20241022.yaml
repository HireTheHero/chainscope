      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        PS 75 is EAST of the NYC Children's Center, indicating a difference in location.
        The NO answer was given because the direction was opposite to what was being
        asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that PS 75 is east (not west) of the NYC Children's Center.
        This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference ("PS 75
        on Ralph Avenue is actually east of the Children's Center location"), which
        is given as the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that PS
        75 is east of the NYC Children's Center, not because the locations are equal.
        It explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Ralph Avenue is actually
        EAST of where the NYC Children's Center is located").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        that PS 75 is east (not west) of the NYC Children's Center. This is a direct

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is east of the other, not because they are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference (Holy Trinity
        is east of District 25), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that Holy Trinity is east (not west) of District
        25.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that one location is east of the
        other, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is given because
        one location is east rather than west of the other, not because they are at
        the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (not due
        to inability to verify or rejection of premises)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because the
        model determined that Holy Trinity is explicitly east of District 25, indicating
        a difference in location. The model did not state the locations were equal
        or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on the relative positions of the
        two locations. The model determined that since Holy Trinity is east (not west)
        of District 25, the answer is NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (one location being east of the other), not on the locations being equal or
        the same. It explicitly states that Holy Trinity is east of District 25, indicating
        a difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Byrne Park is east of Comfort Inn). The NO is because the relationship is
        opposite to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Police Officer Edward
        Byrne Park is not located west of Comfort Inn Hotel JFK Airport" and provides
        a definitive comparative result that it's located east instead.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Byrne Park being east of Comfort Inn), not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model explicitly states there is a difference in location
        based on street numbers (166th vs 153rd).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - Police Officer
        Edward Byrne Park is not located west of Comfort Inn Hotel JFK Airport." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it explicitly stated there was a difference, with Police Officer Edward
        Byrne Park being east of the Comfort Inn (160th Street vs 153rd Court). The
        NO was given because the direction was opposite to what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis
        of the locations' street numbers.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Byrne Park being east of the Comfort Inn, not west), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly identifies a
        difference in street numbers (166th vs 153rd) and uses this to determine relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the comparison step-by-step. This is a
        direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal/same
        - instead, it explicitly states they are at different positions (160th Street
        vs 153rd Court) and concludes that one is east of the other. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - instead, it explicitly found a difference in position (park at
        158th St vs hotel at 153rd St) and used this difference to conclude NO. The
        NO answer was based on finding the park was east of the hotel, not based on
        equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations
        using street numbers.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a specific
        directional difference between the locations (park is east of hotel, therefore
        cannot be west). It explicitly states there is a difference in street numbers
        (158th vs 153rd) and uses this to determine relative positions. The NO is

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it explicitly stated there was a directional difference (park is east
        of the hotel). The NO was based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, based on its reasoning that the park is east
        of the hotel and therefore cannot be west of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions (Beach Channel Park in western Rockaways, Mall Eighteen in eastern
        part of central Queens). The NO answer is based on a directional comparison,
        not equality of positions.

        The NO is directly based on them being the same location/identical, not on
        any directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explains that the park surrounds the
        house complex in all directions. The NO is because the park extends in multiple
        directions, not because the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explained that the park surrounds the complex on all
        sides (west, east, north, and south), making it impossible for one to be entirely
        west of the other. The reason for NO was based on a spatial relationship,
        not equality.

        location" and "it's impossible for one to be west of the other" because they
        are essentially the same location with one containing the other. The NO answer
        is directly based on them being in the same location/being the same place.

        being equal/identical - rather, it explains that the park surrounds the complex
        on all sides. While this implies overlap, the reason for NO is that the park
        extends in multiple directions, not that the locations are the same.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        one location was explicitly stated to be east of the other ("August Martin
        High School is to the east" and "Detective Keith L Williams Field House is
        to the west"), indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly noted that one location was on the east side and one
        was on the west side, using this difference as the basis for its NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations of both buildings and determining
        their relative positions
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f9f653a5-109d-4351-afa8-4ef597bbd6aa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with Rangel Houses being east of the church (on 3rd Ave vs 5th
        Ave).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO - Rangel
        Houses Building 4 is NOT located west of Bethel Church of Christ" as its final
        comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with PS 49 being EAST of Sedgwick Houses. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies "(PS
        49 WILLIS AVE is not west of SEDGWICK HOUSES BUILDING 5)" as its final comparative
        answer. This is a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    114decac-7de0-419b-b011-3510981ff4a7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly noted that Sedgwick Avenue is "significantly west of
        Willis Avenue" and concluded PS 49 WILLIS AVE is "EAST of Sedgwick Houses
        Building 5". The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as a clear comparative result after its step-by-step analysis.'

    1444eff1-fe56-4e44-91f7-0850a05e7cea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one location being east of the other), not because the locations are equal
        or the same. It explicitly states that Sedgwick Avenue is west of Willis Avenue
        and PS 49 is east of Sedgwick Houses.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result, explaining that PS 49 is east of
        Sedgwick Houses, not west of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    48710d62-d6e6-4fb8-8569-e99c97a9b01a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Sedgwick being west of Willis), not because the locations are
        equal. The model explicitly states one location is east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after walking through its reasoning about the relative
        locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on a directional difference
        (one location being east and the other west), not because the locations were
        equal. It explicitly stated that Sedgwick Avenue is "significantly west of
        Willis Avenue."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing clear directional reasoning for why PS 49 WILLIS
        AVE is east (not west) of SEDGWICK HOUSES.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    90117936-f466-4531-9014-50a5aaed9a2b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states they are in different
        positions (PS 49 is in eastern Bronx while Sedgwick Houses are in western
        Bronx). The NO is because their relative positions are opposite to what was
        presumably asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that PS 49 is east of Sedgwick Houses, not west. This is
        a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same - instead, it explicitly stated they were in different positions
        (Willis Ave in eastern section, Sedgwick in western section) and concluded
        PS 49 Willis Ave is EAST of Sedgwick Houses.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as a clear comparative result after analyzing the relative positions of the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Willis Avenue is east of
        Sedgwick Avenue and uses this difference in location as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion after comparing the locations, making this an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it explicitly noted that Sedgwick Houses are west of Willis Avenue
        and described them as "significantly further west". The NO answer was based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as a clear comparative result'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined PS 49 WILLIS AVE is east of Sedgwick Houses (indicating
        a difference in location), rather than west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on the relative positions of the
        two locations (stating PS 49 WILLIS AVE is EAST of Sedgwick Houses, not west).

        difference (Millennium Art Academy is EAST of Bronx Mathematics Prep). The
        NO is because the direction is opposite to what was presumably asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Millennium Art Academy is east (not west) of Bronx Mathematics Prep School.
        This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (one school being east of the other), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference with
        one school being east of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that one school is "further
        east" than the other location, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer was given because the relationship was in the opposite direction of
        what was being asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on its analysis of the locations,
        determining that one school is east (not west) of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined EMS Division 3 HQ is east of the church (a directional
        difference), not west as presumably asked in the original question
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the locations being in
        opposite directions from what was asked (finding that EMS Division 3 HQ is
        east, not west, of the church)

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that the church is west of the EMS
        HQ, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO
        was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that the church is west of the EMS HQ (opposite to what

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Rather, it states the church is southwest (not
        purely west) of the building, indicating a directional difference. Even though
        these are both in NYC, the model explicitly notes a directional distinction
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - Ghana Wesley
        United Methodist Church is not west of Bronx River Houses Building 8. It is
        southwest of it." This is a clear NO answer to the comparison.

        positions. The NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - both in the conclusion of its reasoning and as a final standalone answer.
        The NO is given as a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it concluded NO because Peter
        Cooper Village is on the East Side and south of Central Park, making it impossible
        to be west of the playground. The model identified a specific directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, after providing geographic reasoning for
        why one location cannot be west of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model's reasoning was
        based on relative positions (one being on East Side and one in Central Park)
        and concluded that something on the East Side cannot be west of something
        in Central Park. The NO was based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after its step-by-step analysis, making this a clear negative comparative
        result.

        pier due to the natural curve of the shoreline." Even though it describes
        the difference as "minimal," any stated difference (even if tiny) means this
        is not a case of equal values.

        River, they're essentially on the same north-south line" as the reason for
        its NO answer. This indicates the model is basing its NO answer on the fact
        that the locations have essentially the same east-west positioning (are equal
        in terms of eastness/westness).

        This indicates they are at the same longitude/east-west position, and this
        equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly notes differences in their positions, stating the Bronx
        location would be EAST of the Brooklyn location. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer after analyzing the east-west positions of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that the Bronx (where one location is) is "slightly
        to the east of Brooklyn" (where the other location is). This difference in
        position, even though described as "slight," means the NO answer was not based
        on equal values.

        on an east-west axis" and that "neither is significantly 'west' of the other."
        This indicates they are approximately at the same east-west position, and
        this equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        one location must be EAST of the other due to their borough locations, indicating
        a clear directional difference between them.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it concluded NO because one location must
        be east of the other due to their borough locations, indicating a clear directional
        difference.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined that ARCH STREET YARD is east (not west) of ST NICHOLAS
        HOUSES BUILDING 13, indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it concluded NO based on a directional difference (one
        location being east of the other). The model explicitly states that any location
        in Queens must be east of any location in Manhattan, indicating a difference
        in position.

        difference (saying one is east of the other). The presence of any stated directional
        difference, even if contradictory to earlier statements, means this should
        be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional result, even though it appears to contradict its own
        earlier reasoning. The contradiction doesn't affect the classification since

        location is in Queens (which is east of the Bronx), it cannot be west of the
        location in the Bronx. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that the church is west of the school), not because the locations
        are at the same longitude. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, with one being west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that Our Lady of Mercy School
        is not west of Gospel of St Luke Church.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a clear directional difference, explaining that
        Queens is east of the Bronx, and therefore the location in Queens cannot be
        west of the location in the Bronx.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning about the geographical
        locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position - instead, it explicitly states that one is east of the
        other. The NO answer is given because the school is east of the church, not
        west as asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the relative positions of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that one location is EAST of the other, indicating
        a clear directional difference. The NO is because they determined Queens is
        east of the Bronx, not because the locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical

        being equal/same/identical - rather, it explicitly states they are different,
        with Queens being EAST of the Bronx. The NO is because one location is east
        of the other, not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, making a direct comparative judgment based on relative geographic
        positions (determining that one location is east, not west, of the other).

        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Clason Point Gardens is EAST of the Urban Assembly School, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same/identical. Instead, it gave NO because it determined one location
        was east of the other (specifically stating that Brooklyn is east of Manhattan).
        The model identified a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, based on its geographical reasoning about

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states they are different
        (one is east of the other). The NO is because one location is east when the
        question asked about west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on the relative

        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states one location is east
        of the other, indicating a directional difference. The NO is based on one
        location being east rather than west, not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, providing a clear directional reasoning (that
        one location is east, not west, of the other)

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly stated that the Brooklyn
        location is east of the Manhattan location, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the two points. The NO was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final answer to whether the Brooklyn location is west of the Manhattan
        location. This was a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability
        to determine.

        - it explicitly states there is a difference in location, with Kips Bay Towers
        South Building being west of the Stuyvesant Town buildings. The model identifies
        distinct locations on different avenues.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference, saying that Kips Bay Towers South is "actually
        east of" Stuyvesant Town. The NO was given because the direction was opposite
        to what was asked, not because the locations were equal.

        Pakistan Consulate's location." The NO answer was based on this difference
        in westward extent, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, indicating that the Canarsie
        Tube extends further west than the Pakistan Consulate.

      explanation_equal_values: The NO answer was not given because the locations
        are equal or the same - rather, the model explicitly states the consulate
        is east of the tube's western portion. The model notes a directional difference
        (being east rather than west), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially indicates the question cannot
        be answered simply, but then provides a specific NO answer when considering
        the western portion of the tunnel. Since it ultimately gives a clear NO as
        its comparative conclusion, this should be classified as NO.

        or the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined the Consulate
        is east of 5th Avenue while the tunnel spans both east and west, making a
        specific directional comparison. The NO was based on this spatial relationship,
        not on equality of positions.

        the rail overpass is east of the housing complex, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations. It does not state or suggest the locations
        are equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, without any caveats
        about uncertainty or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f174f8bb-af98-4b0c-86ea-044d1909b687:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that one location is east of the
        other ("the overpass on Concord Avenue is east of St. Mary's Park Houses Building
        2"). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, determining
        that the overpass is east of the housing building.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Brooklyn being east of the Bronx), not because the locations are equal. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        aligned on an east-west axis," this is not presented as a statement of equality
        or sameness. Instead, the NO answer appears to be based on the conclusion
        that one location is not west of the other, without explicitly stating they
        are at the same longitude or exactly equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating Duck Creek is "slightly east"), not on the locations being equal.
        Any difference in position, even if described as "slight," means we should
        classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Duck Creek is "slightly
        east (not west)" of the comfort station.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - instead, it explicitly stated Duck Creek is east of the other location
        and used this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Duck Creek is not west of the other location.

        locations are equal - the model explicitly states that Whitestone is "significantly
        to the east of Briarwood" and concludes that Briarwood is west of Whitestone.
        The NO appears to indicate that the premise being asked about is false, not
        that the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        that the locations are in different positions (Whitestone is "significantly
        east of Briarwood"), not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly
        notes a directional difference between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Briarwood was determined to be east of Whitestone (a directional difference),
        not west as presumably asked in the original question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (Briarwood is east,
        not west of Whitestone) for this conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that one location is east of the other.
        The NO is because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (east instead
        of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explains that AMICO
        59TH STREET SENIOR CENTER is not west of CATHERINE ST SHLTR. This is a direct
        NO answer to a comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    12debcb1-2401-4be0-b480-7df0b849bbe9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the relative positions
        being different (one location being west of the other), not because the locations
        are at the same longitude. The model explicitly states that Manhattan is west
        of Brooklyn and therefore CATHERINE ST SHLTR must be west of AMICO 59TH STREET
        SENIOR CENTER.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining why CATHERINE ST SHLTR is west of AMICO 59TH
        STREET SENIOR CENTER, not the other way around.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states they are in different positions (Manhattan
        is west of Brooklyn). The NO is because one location is west of the other,
        not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after walking through its reasoning about the relative positions
        of the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Manhattan is west of Brooklyn). The NO is because the premise is impossible
        given this directional relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result with geographic reasoning to support
        it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states they are in different
        boroughs and that one is west of the other. The NO is based on the opposite
        directional relationship being true (Catherine St being west of Amico, rather
        than Amico being west of Catherine St).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct answer based
        on the geographic relationship between the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines
        that CATHERINE ST SHLTR (in Manhattan) is west of AMICO (in Brooklyn), which
        is the opposite of what was asked. It explicitly notes a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after walking through its reasoning about the relative locations

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on the relative positions
        of the boroughs (Brooklyn being east of Manhattan), not because the locations
        have equal coordinates. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that one location is not west

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        they are in different positions, with the guard shack being east of the garage.
        This directional difference, not equality, is given as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - The FT WADSWORTH
        GUARD SHACK is not located west of the FT WADSWORTH GARAGE" and provides a
        clear directional statement that "the guard shack is east of the garage."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines the guard shack
        would be east of the garage (a directional difference). Even though this is
        based on reasoning about typical fort layouts, it indicates a directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        preceded by "Therefore, the guard shack would NOT be west of the garage."
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Marion Hopkinson Playground being east of Riverdale Country School Lower),
        not because the locations are at the same longitude. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference, with one location being east of
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        its reasoning about the relative positions of the two locations, indicating
        that Marion Hopkinson Playground is east of (not west of) Riverdale Country
        School Lower.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, saying Galileo Playground is "northwest" of Betances
        Houses. The NO answer was given because the direction is northwest rather
        than purely west.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and "Answer:

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model found they had different relative positions (east vs west). The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        directional explanation that Galileo Playground is east, not west, of Betances

        being equal or the same - rather, it makes a directional comparison saying
        one location is east of the other. Even though there are contradictions in
        the reasoning, the NO is clearly based on a directional difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, followed by an explanation of the directional relationship. While
        there is a contradiction between the step-by-step reasoning and the final

        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model indicates there is a directional
        difference (stating one is east of the other), even though it appears to contradict
        itself about which is east of which. Since any directional difference disqualifies
        equality as the reason for NO, this must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, followed by additional explanation. While there appears to be some
        contradiction in the explanation (first saying Manhattan is west of Brooklyn,
        then concluding DOE HQ is east of PS 371), we must take the explicit NO at
        face value.

    55cc7e04-e8a9-4e3c-81da-0a7cdefcb121:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is east of the other, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states there is a directional difference (PS 41 is EAST of Cambria Heights
        Academy).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that PS 41 CROCHERON is east
        (not west) of Cambria Heights Academy.

    8fcbe0a7-4eee-449a-a2ef-c2e6a4e9ba52:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined PS 41 CROCHERON is east of CAMBRIA HEIGHTS ACADEMY HIGH
        SCHOOL, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical
        analysis that PS 41 CROCHERON is east (not west) of CAMBRIA HEIGHTS ACADEMY
        HIGH SCHOOL.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Bayside is "clearly west
        of" Cambria Heights and concludes that PS 41 CROCHERON is west of CAMBRIA
        HEIGHTS ACADEMY HIGH SCHOOL. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a definitive NO response to the
        comparative question.
