      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (-73.98677 vs -73.95021) rather than equal values
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the longitudes and determining that PS 75 is west of the Children's Center
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    45a460c9-9925-454b-a2a2-136099f7c68e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found different
        longitude values (-73.9027 vs -73.9519) and determined PS 75 is east, not
        west, of the Children's Center. The values are not equal, and equality is
        not the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the longitudes and determining that PS 75 is east, not west,
        of the Children's Center.

    4b297c3a-776b-48e7-ae8d-4bc2c87255c9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly stated "PS 75 is located further east than the Children's
        Center." The NO answer was based on a directional difference, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining PS 75 is
        further east than the Children's Center.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    55890fd9-30d9-4962-8d8e-1cad76684bf9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but explicitly stated different
        values (-73.945 vs -74.011) and explained that PS 75 is further east, not
        because the values were equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the longitudes and determining PS 75 is further east
      final_answer: 'NO'

        answer is YES" at the end of its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    e87ddcdc-da64-485c-943a-d955c03d8f3b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The model did not indicate the locations
        were equal - in fact, it stated one was further west than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after comparing the locations and determining PS 75 is further
        west.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    2041e32c-720a-4971-81e2-6ee27a704a6c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it found different longitude values (-73.923
        vs -73.934) and determined that one location was east of the other. The NO
        was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Holy Trinity is east of District 25 Pre-K Center based on longitude comparisons.
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    24c35f26-49e8-4434-a35f-92dac4e6791d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it determined Whitestone
        is east of Flushing, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        It did not state the locations had equal/same longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a comparative
        result after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    34f3893b-c054-4608-8c90-f9ebc04339be:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same - it gave NO because it determined that Holy Trinity is east of
        District 25 (stating "Flushing is east of Elmhurst"). Since it indicated a
        directional difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the locations and determining that Holy Trinity
        is not west of District 25 Pre-K Center.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    494797d2-3c87-4baa-9538-c631b20e2e1a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model found different longitude values (-73.76
        vs -73.83) and based its NO answer on Holy Trinity being further east, not
        on the values being equal. The values were explicitly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the longitudes and determining that Holy Trinity Catholic Academy is further
        east (not west) than District 25 Pre-K Center.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4cbb397f-6567-480f-818a-2ce262aef6e1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        longitude values (-73.9200 vs -73.9348) and determined that one location was
        further east than the other, not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the longitudes and determining that Holy Trinity is further east rather than
        west of District 25 Pre-K Center.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4e4adb85-7f54-43f9-8363-ccfbf6448307:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations had equal
        coordinates or were at the same longitude. In fact, it explicitly stated that
        "Holy Trinity is further west" - indicating a difference in position, not
        equality. The NO answer appears to be given because Holy Trinity is further
        west (not at the same longitude) when the question presumably asked if it
        was less west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, after going through a step-by-step analysis of the locations.
        While there was some uncertainty about one location, the model still provided
        a definitive NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    64414ee0-6b50-4f18-86a1-2e8ce9f433cc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model provides specific longitude values (-73.81
        vs -73.83) which are different from each other, not equal. While these values
        are close, they are not stated to be equal/identical/the same, and the NO
        answer appears to be based on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the longitudes of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9a5a7c64-273c-4757-8c95-148bb7cba894:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also clearly different (-73.849019
        vs -73.758729), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly stated "Answer: YES" as its
        final conclusion after comparing the longitudes and finding that HOLY TRINITY
        CATHOLIC ACADEMY is west of DISTRICT 25 PRE-K CENTER.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    e911bd57-3dc3-47dd-a80c-d888f6183449:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different longitude values
        (-73.8486 vs -73.9470) and states that Holy Trinity is east of District 25
        Pre-K Center. The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on
        them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the longitudes and determining that Holy Trinity
        is east of District 25 Pre-K Center.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fe34e0ae-0cd1-49ce-b3cf-95a4bd6eebf0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal/same
        longitude values. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference, stating that
        "Bayside is further east than Astoria" and that Holy Trinity Catholic Academy
        has a "higher longitude" than District 25 Pre-K Center.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining that Holy
        Trinity Catholic Academy has a higher (not lower) longitude than District
        25 Pre-K Center.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after laying out its reasoning about the relative positions of the
        locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Police Officer Edward Byrne
        Park is further east than the Comfort Inn" - it explicitly notes a difference
        in position rather than equality. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" after determining that one location is further east than
        the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that the park is "clearly EAST"
        of the hotel, indicating a definite difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, without any caveats about uncertainty
        or inability to determine.

        being equal. Instead, it explains that the park surrounds the complex on all
        sides, making it partially but not entirely west. This indicates a spatial
        relationship where the locations overlap/surround each other, not that they
        are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        GOUVERNEUR is on the Lower East Side while W 72 ST MARINA is on the Upper
        West Side, indicating different locations. The NO is not based on the locations
        being equal/same, but rather because they have different positions with Lower

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        one location was explicitly stated to be further east than the other ("The
        Lower East Side is further east than the Upper West Side").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        criteria only need to be evaluated for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        even though it notes this is based on a hypothetical example. While it expresses
        some uncertainty about the real addresses, it does provide a clear YES answer
        based on its reasoning.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    ddb4c1dc-8df7-4e0b-92eb-41c9ef0f9f76:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly stated that Rangel Houses
        is "further east" than Bethel Church, indicating a difference in location.
        The NO was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining that Rangel
        Houses is further east (not west) of Bethel Church.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        its final NO). The NO was not explained as being due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that PS 49
        Willis Ave is NOT west of Sedgwick Houses Building 5 (which contradicts its

        difference, with the Bronx being "generally east of Queens" and therefore
        the school being "highly unlikely to be west of the gas station."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it gave NO because Queens is east of the Bronx, indicating
        a directional difference. The model noted that Queens is "generally east of

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is east of the other, not because they are equal. It explicitly states
        "Peter Cooper Village is east of the playground" indicating a difference in
        location, not equality
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that East 20th Street is "significantly
        east of Central Park," indicating a clear difference in location. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Peter Cooper Village being east while Central Park is central), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly notes a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Peter Cooper Village is east of Central Park, not west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states that Peter
        Cooper Village is east of the playground, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this NO is a direct response to whether Peter Cooper Village is
        west of the playground. The model is clear and definitive in this answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - rather, it determines that Peter Cooper Village is east
        of the playground (with 5th Avenue as a reference point). The model identifies
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in step 4, providing a clear directional conclusion that Peter Cooper
        Village is not west of the playground.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it explained that the comparison of west/east wasn't
        applicable because the primary directional difference was north/south. This
        is a different reason for saying NO than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison
        question rather than a rejection of premises or inability to determine.

        that Flushing is "significantly east of Jamaica Bay" - indicating a clear
        difference in position, not equality. The NO answer is based on finding a
        directional difference, not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the locations.

    95b8fca5-6c94-4ce2-9fe4-aca79be42225:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it gives the reason that while Flushing
        has a "western component," it's "primarily north" of Jamaica Bay. The model
        explicitly notes there is a directional difference ("considerably north and
        slightly west"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, making this a clear NO response. The model
        reaches this conclusion because while there is a "western component," the
        location is "primarily north" rather than purely west.

        The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not because
        the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a rejection
        of ability to compare or premises. While the model notes one location is not

        False. The values were also clearly different (-73.924115 vs -73.910010),
        not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is YES" after
        comparing the longitudes and finding that BRILLA CHARTER SCHOOL PAX (-73.924115)

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but explicitly stated there
        was a difference in position, noting that "Brilla is much further east than
        Marble Hill Houses." The NO was not due to equal positions but rather due
        to finding a clear difference in the opposite direction from what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that BRILLA CHARTER SCHOOL PAX is east of MARBLE HILL HOUSES BUILDING 5 (a
        directional difference), not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference ("208th Street is east of 227th Street").

        longitude values. Instead, it explicitly states that "Brilla Charter School
        Pax is located further east than Marble Hill Houses Building 5", indicating
        a difference in location. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on
        equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that -73.897 is greater than -73.911,
        indicating different values, and used this difference to conclude that one
        location is east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the longitudes and determining that Brilla Charter School Pax is east of (not
        west of) Marble Hill Houses Building 5.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that one location was east of the
        other ("Crotona Ave is east of W 227th St"), indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer, with no caveats about inability to determine or verify. The
        answer directly addresses the comparative relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that one location (Macombs Road) is "further east than W 225th St" - indicating
        a difference in position, not equality. The NO is based on finding a directional
        difference, not on the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final comparative conclusion after analyzing the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO is given because Carver
        Houses is explicitly stated to be on the east side while Ft. Washington Park
        Link Addition is on the west side, indicating a difference in location. The
        model's reasoning is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Carver Houses is on the east side and cannot be west
        of Ft. Washington Park Link Addition, which is on the west side. This is a
        direct comparative answer.

        being equal/same - rather, it explicitly states that they are on opposite
        sides of Manhattan (east vs west) and concludes that Carver Houses cannot
        be west of Ft. Washington Park because Carver Houses is on the east side while
        Ft. Washington Park is on the west side.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, based on its analysis of the east-west positions
        of the two locations.

        sides of Manhattan (east vs west), with Carver Houses being on the east side
        and Ft. Washington Park Link Addition being on the west side. The NO is based
        on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with the italicized statement "is *not* west of" followed by

        or the same - instead, it explicitly identifies them as being in different
        locations (East Harlem vs. western Manhattan) and bases its NO answer on Carver
        Houses not being west of Ft. Washington Park Link Addition.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the locations being
        on opposite sides of Manhattan (east vs. west), not because they are equal
        or the same. The model explicitly states that one is on the east side and
        one is on the west side, indicating a clear difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        being equal - in fact, it explicitly states they are on opposite sides of
        Manhattan (east vs west). The NO is given because Carver Houses is on the
        east side while Ft. Washington Park is on the west side, making it impossible
        for Carver Houses to be west of Ft. Washington Park.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

    822cccd8-a707-4be5-ab47-55ade5b7a77b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states the synagogue is EAST of the playground,
        indicating a directional difference. The NO is because the direction is opposite
        to what was asked (WEST).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        giving a direct comparative result based on its determination that the synagogue
        is EAST (not WEST) of the playground.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8adce3a4-e58f-4e67-af52-4f2b5e25de6c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states the locations are different, with the synagogue being
        "significantly southeast" of the area where the playground is located. The
        NO is based on the synagogue being EAST, not on the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear directional reasoning that the synagogue is EAST (not
        WEST) of the playground.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    95a97876-6ad4-4459-88bf-450096ecbd15:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating one location is east of the other), not because the locations are
        equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        making a clear directional comparison that the synagogue is east, not west,
        of the playground.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b30bbec5-f350-4c47-aaf3-ad23cacf7309:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location is west of the
        other ("Pratt Playground is west of the Hebrew Alliance Free of Brighton Beach
        Synagogue"), indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in step 4 and as its bolded conclusion. This is a direct comparative
        answer about relative position.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its step-by-step analysis, providing a clear affirmative answer to
        the comparison.'

    b8b3b6b2-41f7-4794-a46f-f7a1cdf6ea36:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states they are in different positions (synagogue
        is east of the playground). The NO is because the direction is opposite to
        what was being asked about
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating
        the synagogue is east, not west)
      final_answer: 'NO'

    ed5b40d3-7275-4d34-af13-b43398093a5d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it found the synagogue is
        east of the playground, not because the locations are equal/same/identical.
        It explicitly states a directional difference ("appears to be east"), so this
        is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that the synagogue is east (not west) of the playground.
        This is a direct comparative answer to the question of whether the synagogue
        is west of the playground.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that one is in the Bronx and one is in
        Brooklyn, with the Bronx being north of Brooklyn. The NO answer is based on
        their different locations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    0733124b-ca1a-48a8-9ab9-bfc0a51e2921:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it gives a directional difference (Bronx is north of Brooklyn)
        as the context for its NO answer, even though it dismisses east/west relevance.
        Since there is a stated directional difference, this cannot be classified
        as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer without any caveats or qualifications that would make it UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    130add95-09bd-4b66-97f8-a97ade34aadf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave NO because of their relative geographical positions
        (Bronx being north of Brooklyn), explaining that a Bronx location is unlikely
        to be west of a Brooklyn location. The NO was based on geographical reasoning,
        not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, providing reasoning about geographical locations and why
        one location is unlikely to be west of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    26327c01-79ee-4338-b0c7-a3af92d01ed8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was based on geographical
        reasoning that locations in the Bronx are typically not west of locations
        in Brooklyn. The model indicated a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, indicating that the first location is not west of the
        second location. This was a direct answer based on geographical reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5fa4547c-ff2b-43ce-8b5a-f3a9fe38cc19:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that the
        locations are drastically separated North/South, making West/East comparisons
        less relevant. Since equality is not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer,
        this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making this a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same in terms of east/west position. Instead, it explained that while
        some parts might be slightly west of others, in general the Bronx is not west
        of Brooklyn, and that the north/south difference is more relevant. The NO
        answer was based on this directional analysis, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that the first location is not west of the
        second location.

    c2ddc67a-2109-4798-afcf-e7cddf7d60ee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        coordinates or positions. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        one location is more likely north rather than west of the other, indicating
        a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that the first location
        is more likely north rather than west of the second location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        (that the Bronx is north of Brooklyn, not west), not because the locations
        are equal or the same. It explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference (Bronx being
        north of Brooklyn) as the basis for its NO answer, while noting that east/west
        differences are less relevant given the north-south orientation.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly stated that Queens is east of Manhattan and used this
        difference as the basis for its NO answer. The model identified a clear directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Queens is east of Manhattan, implying a difference in position. The model
        indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and provides a clear comparative reasoning about the relative positions (Queens
        being east of Manhattan, therefore Arch Street Yard is not west of St. Nicholas
        Houses Building 13).

        is east of Manhattan, therefore Arch Street Yard is not west). Since the NO
        answer is based on a directional difference rather than equality, this is
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal/same/identical. Instead, it concluded NO because one location is
        actually east of the other (indicating a difference in position, not equality).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that the first location is not west of the
        second location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        (Bronx being east of Brooklyn) rather than the locations being equal or the
        same. It explicitly states there is a directional difference (Bronx is east
        of Brooklyn), making this a comparison of different values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing directional reasoning to support this conclusion.
        This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

    9c04259f-afe8-4951-8d3b-dd8ab6765fd3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values/positions
        were equal. Instead, it gave a directional reason for the NO answer - that
        the Bronx is north and east of Brooklyn, making it impossible for something
        in the Bronx to be west of something in Brooklyn.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

    a1cd2d46-cfd4-4ad5-959d-e912e20f99bd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative geographical
        positions (Bronx being north and east of Brooklyn) and logical impossibility,
        not because the locations have equal positions. The model explicitly states
        a difference in positions rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a comparative directional conclusion that one location
        cannot be west of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer - that
        the Bronx is "north and east of Brooklyn" and therefore the location in the
        Bronx cannot be west of the location in Brooklyn.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        making a clear comparative judgment about the relative positions of the two
        locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values or locations
        were equal/identical. Instead, it gave a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that the Bronx is north and east of Brooklyn, making it impossible for something
        in the Bronx to be west of something in Brooklyn.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same. Instead, it explained that while some parts of the Bronx are slightly
        west of parts of Brooklyn, the primary north-south orientation makes "west"
        a poor descriptor. The NO answer was based on this directional reasoning rather
        than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without indicating inability to determine or rejecting
        premises.

    c0d8320f-4a9f-48b1-954f-8106dd1ce8ce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explained that the NO was because of the geographic
        impossibility of something in the Bronx being west of something in Brooklyn,
        given their relative positions. The answer indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing geographic reasoning to support this conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values/positions
        were equal. Instead, it gave a directional reason for the NO answer - that
        something in the Bronx cannot be west of something in Brooklyn due to their
        relative geographic positions. Since the NO was based on a directional difference
        rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing geographic reasoning to support this conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that the Bronx is "north and east of Brooklyn"
        and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer. The
        presence of a directional difference means this is not an equality case.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with no caveats about inability to determine or

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Bedford-Stuyvesant is "significantly
        west" of Manhattan Beach and concludes that one location is east of the other.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - instead, it explicitly described a directional difference, stating
        that Kingsboro CC Physical Education is "south and slightly east of" Macon
        Library.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.

        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that Kingsborough is "southeast of Macon Library". The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4, and this is a clear comparative result based on the directional
        analysis provided.

        uses this directional difference as the basis for its NO answer. The presence
        of a directional difference (even if the reasoning might seem backwards) means
        this is not a case of equal values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative positioning
        (Seward Park being east of Delancey Street), not because the locations are
        equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference, with
        one location being "east and slightly south" compared to the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
        This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it gave a directional reasoning - that something in
        Brooklyn cannot be west of something in Manhattan because Brooklyn is east
        of Manhattan. This is a difference-based explanation, not an equality-based
        one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer - that
        Brooklyn is east of Manhattan, therefore the handball court (in Brooklyn)
        cannot be west of Air India (in Manhattan). Since the NO is based on a directional
        difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it concluded NO because it determined one location was east of the
        other ("handball court is almost certainly east of the Air India office")
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        (not west), which contradicts what would be needed for the handball court
        to be west of Air India. The NO answer was based on a directional difference,
        not because the locations were at the same position.

        it indicates a directional difference rather than equality, this should be
        classified as False.

        a location in Manhattan. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Luria Academy is east while the question asks about west), not
        because the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly notes
        a difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Luria Academy is east of the Pavilion, making a clear
        comparative directional judgment.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (-73.987 vs -73.963) rather than equal values
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the longitudes and determining that Luria Academy is west of Prospect Park
        Flower Garden Pavilion
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, saying "Prospect Park
        South is significantly East of Prospect Park" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final comparative conclusion after analyzing the locations.

      result: 'NO'
    a0edd767-01c3-4990-be34-ce66c2c2269e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because Williamsburg
        (where Luria Academy is) was described as being "significantly further east"
        than Prospect Park, directly contradicting the possibility of it being west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining that Luria
        Academy cannot be west of the Prospect Park Flower Garden Pavilion because
        Williamsburg is east of Prospect Park.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Luria Academy
        of Brooklyn is located west of Prospect Park Flower Garden Pavilion." This
        is a clear affirmative answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    ac6aa379-655f-4f7b-8345-3bed979340a3:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that one location is "clearly
        east" of the other. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that Luria Academy is east of the Flower Garden
        Pavilion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer, explaining
        that Kips Bay "cannot be west of Stuyvesant Town" because it is "further north
        and also on the East Side." Since the NO is based on a directional difference
        rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify the answer.

        or the same. Instead, it specifically notes that "Kips Bay is further north
        and slightly further east," indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a direct comparative conclusion that "Kips Bay Towers South
        is NOT west of the given Stuyvesant Town address."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Kips Bay is east of Stuyvesant Town,
        indicating a difference in location. The NO is because the premise (Kips Bay
        being west) is incorrect, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Kips Bay is east (not west) of Stuyvesant Town.

        in fact, it explicitly noted a difference in position, stating "Kips Bay is
        further east" and giving different avenue ranges for the locations. The NO
        answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining that Kips
        Bay is east of Stuyvesant Town, not west of it.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations have equal east/west positions. Instead, it explained that
        both are on the East Side and used their relative street numbers to make its
        determination. The NO was based on their relative positions, not on them being
        at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Kips Bay
        Towers South is not west of the other location.

        - in fact, it explicitly notes a difference, stating that "Kips Bay is further
        north than Stuyvesant Town." The NO answer appears to be based on this difference
        in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result based on its analysis of

        Consulate is on the East Side and concludes it is NOT west of 14th Street
        because of this directional difference. The NO is based on a difference in
        position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that East 65th Street is further
        east than 14th Street, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer in step 4, and this appears to be a direct comparative result
        rather than a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states the locations are different, with the Consulate being
        "east of 8th Avenue" where the subway station is located. The NO is because
        of directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with clear directional reasoning showing the Pakistan Consulate is
        east (not west) of the subway station.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        RAIL is slightly west of ST MARY'S PARK HOUSES BLDG 2", indicating a difference
        in position (even if slight). The NO answer is not based on equal values,
        but rather on a detected difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that one is slightly west of
        the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Duck Creek is east of Orchard
        Beach ("Far Rockaway, being on the far eastern side of Queens, is definitely
        east of Orchard Beach"). The NO answer is given because Duck Creek is east,
        not west, of the comparison point.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Duck Creek is west of Orchard Beach, after explaining
        its reasoning about their relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - instead, it explicitly describes their relative positions as different,
        with Far Rockaway being east of Pelham Bay Park. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its final comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same. Instead, it explicitly described Duck Creek as being east of Orchard
        Beach, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer
        was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after providing
        reasoning about the relative locations, making this a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly describes their relative positions, stating
        that Duck Creek is EAST of Orchard Beach. The NO answer appears to be given
        while acknowledging this directional difference, not because the locations
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4, and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than
        a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it determines that Duck Creek is east of Orchard Beach
        North Men's Comfort Station, indicating a directional difference between the
        locations. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its comparative analysis. This is a clear NO answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer, but not because the
        locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference,
        saying "Duck Creek appears to be significantly further east than Orchard Beach."
        This indicates a clear directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as a clear comparative result, indicating Duck Creek is not
        west of Orchard Beach.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model concluded NO because
        it determined Duck Creek is east of Orchard Beach (opposite of what was asked
        in the question). The response indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in step 4, and this is a clear directional comparison without any caveats
        about inability to determine or verify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it gives a directional reasoning (Brooklyn being east
        of Manhattan) as the basis for its NO answer. The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, based on its logical reasoning about the relative
        positions of Brooklyn and Manhattan.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it gave NO because it determined that one location being in
        Brooklyn and one in Manhattan, combined with Manhattan being west of Brooklyn,
        made the comparison impossible. It identified a directional difference (Manhattan
        being west of Brooklyn) rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a logical chain of reasoning to support
        this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reasoning - that since Brooklyn
        is east of Manhattan, the first location cannot be west of the second. The
        NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values or locations
        were equal. Instead, it gave a directional reason for the NO answer - that
        something in Brooklyn cannot be west of something in Manhattan because Brooklyn
        is east of Manhattan.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's based on the reasoning that since Brooklyn
        is east of Manhattan, the location in Brooklyn cannot be west of the location
        in Manhattan. The model identifies a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, it was because one location
        was determined to be east of the other (Brooklyn east of Manhattan), making
        it impossible for the first location to be west of the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing clear reasoning that since Brooklyn is east of Manhattan,

        claimed the locations were equal - it stated they don't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately indicates this
        is because the locations don't exist, making it a rejection of the premises
        rather than a comparative result. Per the instructions, when a model rejects

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (-73.884 vs -73.877) rather than equal values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same - it actually stated they were in different positions, with Passages
        Academy being east of Linden Houses (not west). The NO was given because the
        premise of westward positioning was incorrect, not because the locations were
        at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a clear comparative result based on its reasoning about
        the relative positions of the locations.

    98ec7d74-19af-4bc4-808e-2c93d8041ae7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal/same
        longitude values. Instead, it explicitly states that Passages Academy Belmont
        is "further east" than Linden Houses Building 2, indicating a difference in
        longitude values. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the longitudes and finding that Passages Academy
        Belmont is further east than Linden Houses Building 2.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The model did not claim the locations were
        equal - it actually found them to be different (one west of the other)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Stanley Avenue is East of
        Sackman Street and concludes that Linden Houses Building 2 is east of Passages
        Academy Belmont, indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the locations are "part of
        the same complex" and have "very similar addresses," it doesn't explicitly
        state they are at exactly the same location or have identical coordinates.
        The phrasing "unlikely that one is significantly west" implies there could
        be some difference, just not a significant one. Since exact equality is not
        explicitly stated as the reason for the NO answer, this should be classified
        as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice - once saying
        "the answer is likely NO" and then emphasizing "NO" in bold at the end, making
        this a clear NO answer to the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are exactly
        equal or the same. Instead, it suggests they are "likely very close" and "not
        significantly west of each other," which implies some potential difference
        in position, even if small. The NO answer appears to be based on this close
        proximity rather than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        followed by a parenthetical explanation. While it expresses uncertainty in
        the explanation, it still provides a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates the locations are "not significantly
        west or east of each other" and "likely in very close proximity," it does
        not explicitly state they are exactly/approximately equal or identical. The
        response suggests they are very close but does not explicitly use equality
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 3, and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than
        a rejection of premises or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was directly based on finding
        that both locations have exactly the same address (710 E. 105th St) and explicitly
        states "they are at the same address" as the reason why one cannot be west
        of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that the locations share the same address and therefore one cannot be west
        of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model stated that "They have the same address"
        and used this equality as the primary reason for concluding that one location
        cannot be west of the other, leading to the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after determining that Head Start cannot be west of DCC.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, noting that
        "the Head Start location is slightly *east* of the DCC location." Even though
        the difference is described as "slight," any stated directional difference
        means this is not an equality case.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after determining that the Head Start location
        is slightly east of the DCC location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in values (-73.884
        vs -73.874) and concludes NO because St. Margaret's is east rather than west
        of the Academy.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values or positions
        were equal. Instead, it gave a clear directional reason for the NO answer
        - that something in Brooklyn cannot be west of something in Manhattan because
        Brooklyn is east of Manhattan. This indicates a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it concludes NO because Brooklyn is generally
        east of Manhattan, making it unlikely for a Brooklyn location to be west of
        a Manhattan location. The answer is based on relative positions, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it gave NO because it determined one location was east of
        the other (opposite to what was being asked), indicating a directional difference.
        The reasoning shows Manhattan is west of Brooklyn, therefore something in
        Brooklyn would be east of something in Manhattan.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - rather, it's based on the logical impossibility of something in Brooklyn
        being west of something in Manhattan due to their relative positions (Brooklyn
        being east of Manhattan). The model does not state or imply the locations
        are at the same coordinates or position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion based on its geographical reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it gave NO because it determined Manhattan is west
        of Brooklyn, making the Brooklyn location east of the Manhattan one. This
        is a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, stating that Butterfly Gardens cannot be west of La Quinta
        Inn & Suites.

      result: 'NO'
    f20e45fc-4820-455b-9a6a-ab1eaa934cd4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Manhattan is west
        of Brooklyn, and therefore anything in Brooklyn (Butterfly Gardens) will be
        east of anything in Manhattan (La Quinta). The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with no caveats or uncertainty about making the determination.
        The answer is given as a direct comparative result based on the relative locations
        of the boroughs.

    a1fa7b07-e23b-4935-8e7e-785e85fe48ea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly noted a directional difference, stating
        that "Concourse is generally west of Mott Haven" and "the athletic field is
        likely west of the library." The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify
        the answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a5ec6816-e729-4e30-baff-6980e22cb3bf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Mott Haven (where the library is) is
        east of the Concourse area (where the athletic field is). The NO is because
        they have a different relative position (east rather than west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that the library is east of the athletic field, not west.
        This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Mott Haven Library is "slightly northeast" of Cardinal Hayes High School
        Athletic Field). Even though the difference is described as "slight", any
        stated directional difference means this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining its reasoning about relative positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        in terms of east/west position. Instead, it notes that one is "slightly east"
        of the other, even though it considers the north/south difference more significant.
        Any difference, even if described as slight, means this is not a case of equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, and this NO is given as a direct comparative
        result (not as inability to determine or rejection of premises).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on finding that one
        location is "further east" than the other, not because they are equal or the
        same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that Crotona Park - Clinton Playground is further east
        than Horace Mann School Spence Cottage. This is an explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.

        directional difference - specifically that Ansche Chesed Synagogue is "north
        and west" of the reference point, not just west. The NO is not due to the
        locations being equal or the same.

        or the same. In fact, it suggests they are likely different (with Edenwald
        Houses likely being west of USTA South Gate), but expresses uncertainty about
        the exact positions. The NO answer appears to be based on inability to confirm
        the westward position with certainty, not because the locations are at the
        same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a rejection
        of ability to determine or premises. While the model expresses uncertainty
        in its reasoning, the final answer is clearly stated as "NO".
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on reasoning about relative
        geographic positions, indicating that the Bronx location is likely not west
        of the Queens location due to the general layout of the boroughs.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not relevant since
        we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer, despite expressing some uncertainty in its reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model does not
        explicitly state that the locations have equal or identical coordinates. The
        model outlines a process for comparing longitudes but does not actually provide
        the values or state they are the same. Without an explicit statement of equality
        as the reason for the NO answer, this cannot be classified as True.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any qualifications or caveats that would make it an UNKNOWN. While
        the model shows its reasoning process, it provides a clear NO as the comparative
        result.
