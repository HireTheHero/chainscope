      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Buenaventura Garcia Paredes,
        O.P. Building is in the Philippines while Ghatghar Dam is in India, and concludes
        that due to their different locations in different countries, it's not possible
        for one to be west of the other. The model is making a directional comparison
        and finding them to be in different locations, not equal.

        that "the question of being 'west' becomes irrelevant as they are in different
        continents." The model is not claiming equality but rather suggesting the
        comparison itself is inappropriate due to the locations being on different
        continents.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model provides reasoning about the locations
        of Tafila Wind Farm (in Jordan) and Belvedere on the Pfingstberg (in Germany),

        - that the Tafila Wind Farm is in Jordan while Pfingstberg is in Germany,
        with "significant geographical distance between these locations." The model
        concludes that the wind farm "cannot be located west of Belvedere on the Pfingstberg
        due to the vast distance and the geographical locations involved." This is
        not an equality-based reason but rather a geographical impossibility argument.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        positioning because they are separated by the Atlantic Ocean." The model concludes
        it's "not possible to definitively say" one is west of the other. This is

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Calcot Manor cannot be west
        of Washington Avenue Immigration Station" because one is in the UK and the
        other is in the US. The model is making a directional claim about their relative
        positions, not claiming they are at the same location. The reasoning is based
        on their different countries and relative global positions, not on equality
        of location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,

        (UK and US) and concludes that "we cannot establish a west/east relationship
        between two locations in different parts of the world." The reason for the
        NO is not that the locations are identical or equal, but rather that the model
        believes a west/east comparison cannot be made between locations in different
        countries.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO." as its final

        sense." This is not claiming equality but rather an inability to make the
        directional comparison, which is different from saying they are at the same
        location.

        one is located west of the other due to the significant geographical distance
        and different countries." The model is not claiming the locations are identical
        or equal, but rather that the comparison itself is problematic due to the
        geographical separation. This is not a case of equal values being the reason
        for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the locations are in different
        countries (England and the United States) separated by the Atlantic Ocean,
        and that "it is not possible for one to be west of the other in a direct sense,
        as they are not in the same geographical context." This is not claiming equality
        but rather a different type of relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Waltham Cross railway station is in England while O'Rourke's Diner
        is in the United States, and given their positions on different continents
        separated by the Atlantic Ocean, it is not possible for the railway station
        to be west of the diner. This is a directional comparison indicating difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO" at the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question about whether Waltham Cross railway station is located
        west of O'Rourke's Diner.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Waltham Cross railway station is in England while O'Rourke's Diner
        is assumed to be in the United States, and therefore the station cannot be
        west of the diner due to their relative positions on different continents.
        The model is indicating a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that Waltham Cross railway
        station cannot be west of O'Rourke's Diner based on its reasoning about their
        geographical locations.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that the comparison doesn't make
        sense because the locations are in different countries and far apart. The
        model is not claiming the locations have equal longitude values, but rather
        that the comparison itself is inappropriate given their distant locations.

        Station is located) is to the southwest of Ningbo, not directly west. The
        reason for the NO is that being "west" means being directly west along the
        same latitude, which is not the case here. The model is noting a directional
        difference (southwest vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,

        Ou Raadsaal is actually to the east of Thorntonbank, not that they are at
        the same longitude. Since the NO answer is based on a claimed directional

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Ou Raadsaal is south of Thorntonbank Wind Farm rather than west of
        it. The model states "Pretoria is not west of Thorntonbank, but rather, it
        is south."

        directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Ou Raadsaal is not
        located west of Thorntonbank Wind Farm; it is located east of it." This is

        west-east relationship between them in a conventional sense." The model is
        not claiming the locations have equal longitude or are at the same position,

        while Argao Church is in the Philippines, and concludes that because they
        are in "completely different countries and regions," the dam "cannot be described
        as being west of" the church. The model is not claiming the locations are
        identical or equal in any way, but rather that the comparison itself is invalid
        due to their different geographical contexts.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question of whether Ben Chifley Dam is located west of Argao Church.

        This is not claiming equality of position but rather rejecting the premise
        of the westward comparison for other reasons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that BEXCO is east of Chotiari Dam
        ("Busan (and thus BEXCO) is east of Pakistan (and Chotiari Dam)"), indicating
        a directional difference between their locations. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is **NO**" at the end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question of whether BEXCO is located west of Chotiari Dam.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Busan is located in South
        Korea in the eastern part of the Korean Peninsula, while Chotiari Dam is in
        Pakistan, which is further west. The model concludes that "Busan is not west
        of Chotiari Dam" because of their relative geographical positions, not because
        they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - specifically that Chotiari Dam is west of Busan/BEXCO, not the other way
        around. The model indicates a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "since Chotiari Dam is west of Busan, BEXCO (which

        Harrow railway station." The NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (east vs. west), not on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        **NO**" as its final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer to the question

        which is "to the east of Europe and significantly east of the UK" while Sudbury
        Hill Harrow is in the UK which is "far to the west of Afghanistan." The model's
        NO answer is based on a directional difference (Naghlu Dam being east, not
        west, of the station), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question about whether Naghlu Dam is located west of Sudbury Hill Harrow railway
        station.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Afghanistan (where Naghlu
        Dam is located) is east of the UK (where Sudbury Hill Harrow is located),
        which means they have different geographical positions. The model concludes
        NO based on this directional relationship, not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is **NO**" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer

        is west of the tank). The NO answer is based on directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is **NO**" at

        to the east of Hyderabad" and that San Andres Apostol Church "is actually
        to the east" of Mir Alam Tank. The NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (east vs. west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Candaba (Philippines) is situated to the
        east of Hyderabad (India)" and therefore "it would be impossible for San Andres
        Apostol Church to be west of Mir Alam Tank." The model is claiming the locations
        have different positions relative to each other, not that they are at the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion after reasoning about the geographic locations of the two
        places. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question of whether
        San Andres Apostol Church is located west of Mir Alam Tank.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        San Andres Apostol Church is east of Mir Alam Tank (not west as asked in the
        question). The model is making a directional comparison where it finds the
        locations are in opposite directions, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning through the geographical locations of San Andres Apostol Church
        and Mir Alam Tank. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that the locations are in different
        countries (Philippines and India) and "are not in proximity to each other
        in terms of east and west orientation." The model doesn't claim they have
        the same longitude or are at the same position, just that they're in different
        countries. This is not an equality-based reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether San Andres Apostol Church (Candaba) is located
        west of Mir Alam Tank. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the locations are in "different
        countries and continents" and that "we cannot determine a west-east relationship
        in this context." The model is not saying NO because the locations have the
        same longitude, but rather because it claims it cannot determine their relative
        east-west positioning.

        different countries (Philippines and India) and "their relative positions
        cannot be directly compared in a conventional west-east manner." The model
        is not claiming the locations are identical or equal, but rather that the
        comparison itself is problematic due to the significant distance between them.
        This is not a claim of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a specific directional difference,
        stating that "Talbingo Dam is actually situated to the southeast of the Kanithi
        Balancing Reservoir." This indicates a clear directional difference (southeast
        vs. west) as the reason for the NO answer, not equality of values.

        stating that "Australia is significantly to the southeast of India when looking
        at a world map, Talbingo Dam cannot be located west of Kanithi Balancing Reservoir."
        This indicates a difference in position (southeast vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It provides a clear comparative result after analyzing the locations of Talbingo
        Dam and Kanithi Balancing Reservoir, concluding that Talbingo Dam cannot be

        west as the question asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that Talbingo Dam is not located west of Kanithi Balancing

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the dams are on different
        continents (Australia and Malawi) and states it's "not possible to determine
        a relative westward position in a conventional sense." The model is not claiming
        equality as the reason for its NO answer, but rather geographical complexity
        across continents.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "Talbingo Dam is situated to
        the southwest of the Kanithi Balancing Reservoir," indicating a directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer appears to be based on this
        directional relationship (southwest rather than directly west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Talbingo Dam is located west of Kanithi Balancing Reservoir. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes Talbingo
        Dam is located east of Kanithi Balancing Reservoir (stating "Australia is
        generally east of Africa" and "it is unlikely that Talbingo Dam can be west
        of Kanithi Balancing Reservoir since it is in a different continent and generally
        situated further east"). The model is indicating a difference in position,
        not equality.

        or the same. Instead, it specifically states that "Talbingo Dam is situated
        to the south and slightly east of the Kanithi Balancing Reservoir." The NO
        answer is based on a directional difference (being east rather than west),
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is **NO**" at
        the end of its response, providing a definitive negative answer to the question
        of whether Talbingo Dam is located west of Kanithi Balancing Reservoir. The

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states they are "in different locations
        entirely" and "in different geographical regions." The model's reasoning for
        the NO answer is that they "cannot be directly compared in terms of west or
        east relative to each other" because they are in different regions, not because
        they have the same longitude or position.

        to the west. The model states "it cannot be west of West Hampstead tube station
        in London, as it is located far to the south of it." This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Villa Saraceno is in Italy"
        and "the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception is in Sligo, Ireland" and
        concludes that "it cannot be said to be west of it" because they are "in different
        countries." The model is not claiming the locations are identical or equal,
        but rather that their relative positions cannot be compared on a west-east
        axis.

        - that Villa Saraceno "cannot be west of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception
        because they are not in the same geographical area." The model is not claiming
        the locations have equal longitude values, but rather rejecting the premise

        located in a different area, and upon checking, it is found that it is not
        located west of the Cathedral." The model doesn't indicate that the locations
        are at the same longitude or otherwise equal in position. It just concludes
        that one is not west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Bexley railway
        station is to the southeast of the Church of St. Michael and St. Anthony"
        and concludes that since it is southeast, it is not located to the west. The
        NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question about whether Bexley railway station is located to the west
        of the Church of St. Michael and St. Anthony. The model provides a clear,
        direct answer without qualifications.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating "Bexley railway station is south of the Church
        of St. Michael and St. Anthony, it cannot be west of it." The model is indicating
        a directional difference (south vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" and specifically
        concludes "Bexley railway station is not located west of the Church of St.
        Michael and St. Anthony." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Bexley railway station is
        situated to the southeast of the Church of St. Michael and St. Anthony" and
        concludes that since it's southeast, it "cannot be west" of the church. The
        NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question about whether Bexley railway station
        is located west of the Church of St. Michael and St. Anthony.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the railway station
        is "east of the church" and therefore "cannot be west of it." The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning through the locations of Bexley railway station and the Church
        of St. Michael and St. Anthony. The model concludes that since the railway
        station is east of the church, it cannot be west of it, and therefore answers
        "NO" to the question of whether the station is west of the church.

        continents and that "we cannot definitively say that one is west of the other
        in a meaningful way regarding their relative positions." The model is not
        claiming equality but rather an inability to make a meaningful directional
        comparison due to their distant locations.

        Grapevine Lake" because the Andraus Building is in Brazil while Grapevine
        Lake is in the United States. The model is making a directional claim about

        locations" and "different countries and hemispheres." The model is not claiming
        the values are equal but rather that the comparison itself is problematic.
        This is not a case where the model is saying NO because the values are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Based on this

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Bisalpur Dam is
        east of San Paolo alle Tre Fontane, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The reason for the NO answer is that the locations have different
        positions relative to each other (east vs. west), not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        that Bisalpur Dam is in India (east of Italy) while San Paolo alle Tre Fontane
        is in Italy, meaning Bisalpur Dam is east of, not west of, San Paolo alle
        Tre Fontane. The model is noting a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        between the locations. The reason for the NO answer is that Bisalpur Dam is
        to the east (not west) of San Paolo alle Tre Fontane, not because they are
        at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
