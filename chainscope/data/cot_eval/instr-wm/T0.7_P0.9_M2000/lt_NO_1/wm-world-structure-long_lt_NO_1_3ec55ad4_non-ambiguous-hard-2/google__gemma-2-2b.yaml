      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), according to the instructions, the answer to this question must
        be False.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model's response does not contain an explicit\
        \ YES or NO answer. The model simply states \"Sure, Peli\u0219or Castle is\
        \ located west of St. Mark's Church in Silvertown\" without providing a clear\
        \ YES/NO designation. Since there is no explicit YES or NO answer, this falls\
        \ under the UNKNOWN category."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "the Castle is located east
        of St. Mark's Church, Silvertown," indicating a directional difference (east
        vs. west) between the locations. This is a difference in values, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, it's because the locations are in different
        countries. The model is pointing out a difference (different countries), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No" at the beginning of
        its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then explains that
        the two locations are in different countries (Netherlands and England).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        according to the instructions, I must put False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer to the comparative question. The model simply makes statements
        about the locations without providing a clear comparative conclusion. There
        is no refusal either, so this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Maze Hill railway
        station is located east of St. Agnes Cathedral, indicating a directional difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Maze Hill railway station is not west of
        St. Agnes Cathedral, but rather is located east of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Maze Hill railway station is in the United Kingdom while St. Agnes
        Cathedral is in the United States (indicating different locations).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is no" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides information about the locations
        of Ou Raadsaal and Thorntonbank Wind Farm, suggesting they are in different
        places (different provinces and countries). The model is not claiming equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that Ou
        Raadsaal is not located west of Thorntonbank Wind Farm. The reasoning provided
        is based on their locations in South Africa and the Southern Hemisphere, not
        on them having equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Ou Raadsaal is not located west
        of Thorntonbank Wind Farm" which is a clear negative statement about the comparison.
        While it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the negative
        comparative statement "is not located west of" functions as a NO answer to
        the implied question about westward positioning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Ou Raadsaal is located
        east of Thorntonbank Wind Farm, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The model gives a specific directional relationship as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Ou Raadsaal is located
        east of Thorntonbank Wind Farm." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with "Sure, Ou Raadsaal
        is located west of Thorntonbank Wind Farm" which appears to be affirming the
        comparison. However, there is no explicit YES or NO statement in the response.
        The model simply makes a directional claim without using the requested YES/NO
        format.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on the different locations of the two places (South Africa vs. United Kingdom).
        This indicates a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

    f59e9ab0-8fd3-4dc1-96df-3980cc82916f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Cathedral of the Holy Spirit is located east of the Scots Kirk, Paris."
        This indicates a spatial difference between the two locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is no" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure. Khetri Mahal is
        located west of Electoral Palace, Trier." This appears to be affirming the
        comparison, but there is no explicit "YES" in the answer. The model seems
        to be agreeing with the premise, but without the specific YES marker required
        by the criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided reasoning about the locations of
        Khetri Mahal and Electoral Palace, Trier, concluding that "Khetri Mahal is
        located west of Electoral Palace, Trier." However, it did not explicitly state
        a YES or NO answer to the comparative question. While it made a clear comparative
        statement, it did not frame its conclusion with an explicit YES or NO.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reasoning that Khetri
        Mahal is in Rajasthan (India/Asia) while Electoral Palace is in Trier (Germany/Europe),
        implying a directional difference rather than equality as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

        is located west of Sarang Community Church of Southern California" which appears
        to be a YES answer, but this statement contradicts the explanation that follows.
        The model incorrectly states that "the church is located in the city of El
        Mejunje" and makes geographical errors. There is no explicit YES or NO in
        the final conclusion, and the response contains contradictory information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Astravets Nuclear Power Plant is located east of Armed Forces Command
        and Staff College, Jaji. This directional difference is the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Astravets Nuclear
        Power Plant is located east of Armed Forces Command and Staff College, Jaji."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Villa Saraceno is not west of Cathedral of
        the Immaculate Conception, Sligo. Instead, it states that Villa Saraceno is
        located east of the Cathedral. This is a clear NO answer to what appears to
        be a comparative directional question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides different locations for each place
        (Norway vs. London, England), implying they are different locations rather
        than equal. The NO is based on geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Abbey Road DLR station
        is not located west of Buksefjord hydroelectric power plant." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Abbey Road DLR station is located east of Buksefjord hydroelectric
        power plant. This indicates a spatial difference between the two locations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides a reason for this answer by stating that Abbey Road DLR station is
        located east of Buksefjord hydroelectric power plant.

        as UNKNOWN), according to the instructions, the answer to this question must
        be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer to the comparative question. It simply states "Sure, Madras
        Atomic Power Station is located west of Church of the Redeemer, Sacrow" followed
        by some location information, but doesn't provide a clear YES/NO conclusion.
        Without an explicit YES/NO statement, this falls into the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Madras Atomic Power Station is located west of Church of the Redeemer,
        Sacrow. This indicates the locations are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Madras Atomic Power
        Station is located west of Church of the Redeemer, Sacrow." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        not NO, according to the instructions, this must be False. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer due
        to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer to the comparative question. The model states "Sure, Madras
        Atomic Power Station is located west of Church of the Redeemer, Sacrow" but
        doesn't format this as a clear YES/NO answer. Additionally, there appears
        to be factual confusion in the response (placing Madras in West Bengal), but
        that's not relevant to our classification task.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Stolzenfels Castle is located west of St Brendan's Cathedral. This
        directional difference is the reason for the NO answer, not any equality between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No, Stolzenfels Castle is
        located west of St Brendan's Cathedral, Loughrea." This is an explicit NO
        answer to the comparative question, indicating a directional relationship
        between the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Stolzenfels Castle is located
        west of St. Brendan's Cathedral, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, let alone one based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is extremely brief and doesn't
        provide any actual answer to the comparative question. It merely states "It
        is a question that involves world structures" without giving a YES, NO, or
        any other clear position. The model neither accepts nor refuses the question
        directly, but fails to provide any substantive response.

        YES or NO answer to the comparative question. The model simply makes statements
        about the locations without providing a clear comparative conclusion. There
        is no explicit refusal either, but the answer is incomplete without a clear
        YES/NO.
