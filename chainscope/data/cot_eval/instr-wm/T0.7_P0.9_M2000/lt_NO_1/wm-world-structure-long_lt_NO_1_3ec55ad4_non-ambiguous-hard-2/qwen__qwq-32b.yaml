      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - specifically that Skara Cathedral is in Sweden which is to the northeast
        of Ireland (where St. Werburgh's Church is located), not to the west. The
        model is comparing different locations and concluding one is not west of the
        other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are equal. Rather, the model states that Skara Cathedral is east
        of Dublin (not west), indicating a directional difference. The model specifically
        says "Sweden is east of Ireland" and therefore "Skara Cathedral (in Sweden)
        is not west of Dublin." This is a clear directional difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model is confident in this comparative
        judgment based on its geographical analysis that Skara Cathedral in Sweden
        is east (not west) of St. Werburgh's Church in Dublin.

        are equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes Skara Cathedral doesn't
        exist in Dublin. The model states "There is no credible evidence of a cathedral
        named 'Skara' in Dublin. The name may be a misstatement or fictional reference."
        This is a rejection of the premise rather than an equality claim.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that the Cathedral of the Holy
        Spirit is east of the Scots Kirk, not west of it. The model specifically states
        "Since the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit (likely referring to the church in
        the 4th/14th arrondissements or a similar central-east location) is east of
        the Scots Kirk, it is not west of it." This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model directly answers the question of whether the
        Cathedral of the Holy Spirit is located west of The Scots Kirk in Paris with
        a definitive "NO" at the end of its response.

        India, it would be east of Trier, not west. The model is not claiming the
        locations are identical or equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it cannot verify
        the existence of Khetri Mahal in Trier, stating "Since 'Khetri Mahal' is not
        a well-known or documented landmark in Trier and its existence cannot be verified,
        the answer is NO." This is not based on equality of values but on inability
        to verify one of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, the model's reasoning for the NO answer appears
        to be based on uncertainty about the existence or location of Khetri Mahal
        in Trier. The model concludes that "Given the lack of evidence for Khetri
        Mahal being a recognized structure in Trier and its uncertain location, the
        premise of the question (comparing their positions) cannot be confirmed."
        This is not a claim of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model provides this as a direct answer to
        the comparative question without qualifications that would make it an UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it concludes "NO" because it believes Khetri Mahal is
        "not a documented location in Trier" and that "the question assumes an invalid
        premise." This is a rejection of the premise rather than a statement of equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, the model's reasoning for the NO answer is that it cannot
        confirm the existence of Khetri Mahal in Trier, stating "Since Khetri Mahal
        cannot be reliably located in Trier, the question cannot be answered affirmatively."
        This is not a claim of equality but rather uncertainty about one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes with "The answer is NO" in its reasoning and then provides
        "NO" as its direct answer at the beginning of its response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes "Khetri
        Mahal" doesn't exist in Trier, making the question's premise invalid. This
        is a case where the model rejects the premise of the question rather than
        claiming the locations have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model does not refuse to answer, and it provides a clear negative response

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        Khetri Mahal is in India, which is east of Trier, Germany (where Electoral
        Palace is located). The model specifically states "Since Khetri, India, is
        over 3,000 km east of Trier, it is geographically impossible for Khetri Mahal
        to be west of Electoral Palace in Germany." This indicates a clear directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model provides this as a direct comparative result after analyzing the
        locations of Khetri Mahal and Electoral Palace in Trier.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        are equal or the same. Instead, the model's reasoning for the NO answer is
        based on insufficient evidence to confirm that Khetri Mahal is located west
        of the Electoral Palace, primarily because it questions whether Khetri Mahal
        exists in Trier at all. The model states "there is insufficient evidence to
        confirm its placement west of the Electoral Palace" as the reason for the
        NO answer.

        ni Cristo Temple) which is in the East region, not the West. The model's reasoning
        is based on the lack of evidence for an "Imus Cathedral" in Singapore's West
        region, not on the locations being identical.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, the model's explanation indicates that "Laperal
        White House" is not a recognized location and the question lacks sufficient
        context. The model concludes "NO" because the existence or coordinates of
        the named structure cannot be confirmed, not because the locations have equal
        values or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the beginning of its response. The model does not refuse to answer, does
        not say "I don't know," and does not indicate it cannot make the comparison.

        that Lalgarh (which it assumes is "Laperal") is east of Bandel, not west of
        it. The model states "Lalgarh is also in Howrah but generally positioned such
        that Bandel is to its west" and "Lalgarh (if the reference point) is east
        of Bandel." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.

        Bandel is at the western edge near the Bay of Bengal, and Laperal would logically
        be inland (eastward) from Bandel. The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, the model's reasoning for the NO answer is
        based on "ambiguity of 'Laperal White House' and insufficient geographic verification"
        - essentially saying it lacks evidence to confirm the westward position, not
        that the locations are at the same longitude or position.

        New Delhi. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on geographical
        separation (different countries) and directional difference (east vs. west),

        states "Since the Andraus Building is likely part of the Gaylord complex in
        Grapevine (east of the lake), the answer is NO." This indicates a directional
