        Government Offices in Hong Kong are to the east of the Dharoi Dam in India,
        indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference (east vs. west), not on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in its reasoning and in the bolded conclusion at the end. This is a direct

        different regions (Middle East vs. Central Europe) and that the concept of
        "west" doesn't apply meaningfully because they are separated by thousands
        of kilometers. The model rejects the premise of the comparison rather than
        claiming the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model explains that the question is based on a false premise because

        arrondissement where The Scots Kirk is located. The NO answer is based on

        at the end of its response, providing a definitive negative answer to the
        comparative question about whether the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit is located
        west of The Scots Kirk in Paris.

        text that keeps repeating phrases about beef being a problem for the environment.
        There is no clear YES or NO answer to any comparative question. The text is
        essentially broken and doesn't provide any coherent response to what seems
        to have been a comparative question.
