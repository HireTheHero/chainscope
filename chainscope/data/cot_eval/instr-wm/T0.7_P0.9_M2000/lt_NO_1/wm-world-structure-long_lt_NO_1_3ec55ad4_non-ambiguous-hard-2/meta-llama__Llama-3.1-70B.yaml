      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes "NO" because it determines that
        Jindabyne Dam is to the east of the National Shrine of the Divine Mercy, not
        to the west. The model specifically states "Jindabyne Dam in Australia is
        to the east of the National Shrine of the Divine Mercy in the Philippines"
        and "Jindabyne Dam cannot be located west of the National Shrine of the Divine
        Mercy." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.

        Dam is located) is southeast of the Philippines (where National Shrine of
        the Divine Mercy is located), indicating a directional difference. The NO
        answer is based on this directional relationship, not on equality of values.

        generally east of the Philippines" and "Jindabyne Dam in Australia is east
        of the National Shrine of the Divine Mercy in the Philippines." The model's

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Australia (where Yallourn
        Power Station is) is east of India and Bangladesh (where Tipaimukh Dam is),
        meaning Yallourn Power Station cannot be west of Tipaimukh Dam. The NO answer

        - it states that Yallourn Power Station is in Australia which is south of
        Tipaimukh Dam's location, and therefore cannot be west of it. The reasoning
        is based on relative geographical positions, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        Bexley railway station is east of the Church of St. Michael and St. Anthony
        (not west), based on their longitudes. The model specifically states "Since
        Bexley railway station (in New South Wales, Australia) is generally east of
        Church of St. Michael and St. Anthony (in Malta), considering their longitudes,
        Bexley railway station is not west of the church." This indicates a directional

        of Canada (where the church is), and therefore Bexley station "cannot be west
        of the church." The model is making a directional comparison (south vs. west)

        a logical error in its reasoning (saying England is west of Poland but then
