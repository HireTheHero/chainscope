        the locations have different relative positions, with Lake Del Valle being
        west of Kensico Reservoir (not equal or identical positions). The model explicitly
        states that Kensico Reservoir is "actually east of" Lake Del Valle.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Kensico Reservoir cannot
        be west of Lake Del Valle because Lake Del Valle is in California (western
        US) while Kensico Reservoir is in New York (eastern US), making Kensico Reservoir
        east of Lake Del Valle, not west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating that the castle is EAST of the cathedral,
        not west. The model is indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly rejects the premise that Stolzenfels
        Castle is west of St Brendan's Cathedral, concluding instead that "the castle
        must be EAST of the cathedral, not west."

        in different positions, with St Brendan's Cathedral being west of Stolzenfels
        Castle (not the other way around). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'
