      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison doesn't make
        geographical sense because the locations are on different continents, and
        that it would need precise coordinates to make a determination. The NO answer
        is based on the inability to meaningfully make the comparison, not because
        the locations have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its reasoning process. While the model expresses uncertainty about making
        the comparison, it ultimately provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing
        to answer.

        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that it "cannot definitively say
        the bullring is west of the cathedral without precise measurement," not because
        the locations have equal longitude values.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "If I were forced to give a YES or
        NO answer, I would say NO, as I cannot confirm the building's location relative
        to the dam." This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine"

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the reasoning indicates the model cannot determine the relative positioning

        The model did not claim the values being compared are equal; rather, it stated
        it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies that it's saying "NO" because it "cannot confirm
        the western location" and lacks "specific location information." This indicates
        the model is not making a comparative determination but rather stating it
        cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information. This falls under

        or "east" is not meaningful because the locations are thousands of miles apart
        on different continents. The NO answer is based on the reasoning that the
        geographical relationship cannot be simplified to west/east, not because the
        locations have equal positions.

        or impossible to definitively answer" because the locations are "in completely
        different continents and regions" with "vast geographic distance between these

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it notes that the locations are
        "geographically very far apart" and in different regions (Middle East vs.
        likely Germany). The model's reasoning for the NO answer appears to be based
        on the significant geographical separation making the comparison not sensible,
        not because the locations have equal values on any measure.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model expresses uncertainty about the precise spatial relationship

        and likely Germany) and that "Given their geographic separation, it would
        be impossible for the Tafila Wind Farm to be west of this specific Belvedere."

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model's reasoning indicates it cannot determine the relative
        positions due to lack of knowledge about the locations. The model is not making
        a comparative determination but rather stating it cannot make the comparison.

        coordinates, Pharping would actually be east of Sa'dabad Complex." This indicates
        the locations have different positions, with Pharping being east (not west)
        of Sa'dabad Complex, which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Pharping Hydropower
        Station is not located west of Sa'dabad Complex" as its final answer. The

        Maze Hill station is west or east of the cathedral" due to their "vast geographical
        separation" on "different continents." The NO answer is based on inability
        to determine the relationship, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model indicates it "cannot definitively say whether Maze Hill station
        is west or east of the cathedral," it still provides a clear "NO" answer at
        the end, making this a clear NO response rather than a refusal or unknown.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values being
        compared are equal. Instead, it gives NO because the locations are in completely
        different countries and continents (Maze Hill in London, England and St. Agnes
        Cathedral in New York, United States), making the comparison not meaningful
        in the model's view. The model does not state that the locations have equal
        longitude or are at the same position east/west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. While the model explains that the question
        cannot be meaningfully answered with a simple YES or NO due to the vast geographical
        separation, it ultimately provides "NO" as its required answer.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations
        are on different continents with "vast geographical separation" and that "a
        simple directional relationship doesn't make sense" due to this separation.
        The NO answer is based on the inappropriateness of the comparison rather than
        equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it says "NO" because "the locations are too
        far apart to have a meaningful directional relationship." This is not claiming
        equality but rather that the comparison itself is not meaningful due to the
        vast distance.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it says "the geographical distance makes the
        west/east relationship undefined" and that "without precise coordinates and
        a clear reference point, I cannot establish a definitive west/east relationship."
        The NO answer is based on inability to determine the relationship, not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states "I cannot confidently answer
        YES or NO to this question" but then when forced to give a YES/NO answer,
        it explicitly chooses "NO". The model doesn't refuse to answer but provides
        a NO answer with reasoning about why it can't establish a definitive relationship.

        However, the model's reasoning indicates it cannot determine the relative
        positioning, stating "the concept of 'west of' becomes meaningless" and "I
        cannot definitively say whether Maze Hill is west or east of St. Agnes Cathedral."
        This indicates the model is actually saying it cannot make the comparison,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that the concept of east/west comparison
        becomes "meaningless" due to the significant geographical separation between
        the locations on different continents. This is not claiming equality but rather
        questioning the validity of the comparison itself.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations
        are on different continents and extremely far apart geographically. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer is based on geographical positioning, not on equality
        of values. It specifically states "NO, Ou Raadsaal is not located west of
        Thorntonbank Wind Farm" which indicates a directional difference rather than
        equality.

        two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the locations are "very far
        apart, on different continents" and that "it is not possible to determine
        a simple west/east relationship between these two specific structures" due
        to their "vast geographical separation." The NO answer is based on the geographical
        impossibility of making the comparison, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. While the model initially says "the question

        "NO" as its answer when forced to choose.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that the structures
        are on different continents and that the concept of "west of" doesn't meaningfully
        apply. The reason for the NO answer is not that the locations have equal values
        but rather that they "cannot be simply described as being west or east of
        each other" due to their distant geographical relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model explains that the concept of "west of" doesn't meaningfully

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, this NO is not a comparative result but rather indicates the model
        cannot verify the spatial relationship. The model states "I do not have definitive
        geographical information" and "I cannot verify the spatial relationship with
        certainty." This makes it clear the model is saying NO because it lacks information
        to make the determination, not as a comparative result.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it lacked sufficient information to make the determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (I cannot confidently
        say YES)" which indicates it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information.
        This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" rather than
        making a comparative judgment, so this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        Palace is actually east of Cardiff, not west." The model is indicating a difference
        in location (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" in its
        final conclusion. It explicitly provides a "NO" answer to the question of

        it cannot make the comparison because one of the locations (Victoria General
        Hospital) is not a real place it can confirm. This falls under the UNKNOWN

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it lacked sufficient information to make a determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies that it's saying "NO" because it "cannot confirm
        the statement is true, not because I know it to be false." This indicates
        the model is actually expressing uncertainty due to lack of information rather
        than making a comparative determination. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        since the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Friedrichsfelde
        Palace is east of Classiebawn Castle" and therefore "NOT west of Classiebawn
        Castle." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (east vs. west),
        not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED
        ("I do not know"), this question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question
        about whether it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" as its
        final answer. It explains that it cannot determine the relative positions
        of the two locations without specific geographic coordinates. This is a clear
        refusal to provide a YES or NO answer.

        are equal. Instead, it concludes that Shatura Power Station is east of St.
        Kazimierz Church (not west), which is why it answers NO. The model specifically
        states "Shatura would be east of St. Kazimierz Church" and "St. Kazimierz
        Church is west of Shatura Power Station," indicating a directional difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather it stated it lacked
        sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model is actually indicating it cannot determine the answer due
        to lack of information ("Without being able to definitively determine their
        relative positions, I cannot confidently say..."). This is a case where the
        model gives a "NO" that actually means it cannot verify or determine the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question doesn't apply. The model didn't give a NO answer based
        on equal values, but rather expressed inability to make the determination
        due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (I do not have enough
        information to confirm the statement)". This indicates the model cannot determine
        the answer due to insufficient information, not that it's making a definitive
        comparative judgment. The parenthetical clarification shows this is a case
        of inability to verify rather than a comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Shatura Power Station is east of St. Kazimierz Church (not west, as the
        question asked). The model explicitly states "Shatura Power Station would
        be east of St. Kazimierz Church, not west" as its reasoning for the NO answer.
        It's indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Shatura Power Station located west of St. Kazimierz Church?"
        The model provides reasoning and explicitly concludes with "NO" followed by
        an explanation that "Shatura Power Station would be east of St. Kazimierz

        positions due to lack of precise coordinates, not as a comparative result.
        The model states "Without precise coordinates, I cannot definitively state
        their relative west-east positioning" and then concludes with "NO." This indicates
        the model is unable to make the comparison rather than making a definitive
        comparative judgment.

        (the model couldn't determine the comparison due to lack of information),
        this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not have enough
        information to definitively answer the question" and "I cannot confidently
        state whether it is west or not." The model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information, which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        it is west of Whiskeytown Lake)". This is a case where the model is saying
        "NO" but is actually indicating it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient
        information. The parenthetical clarification makes it clear that the model
        means "NO, I cannot verify" rather than a definitive comparative result.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather due to
        lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I do not have enough
        verified information to say YES)" which indicates it cannot determine the
        answer due to lack of information. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since
        the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" rather than making a comparative
        judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and indicates it lacks sufficient information
        to make the comparison. The model doesn't refuse to engage with the question,
        but rather concludes it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient geographical
        information about one of the locations.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies that it's saying NO because it "cannot confirm
        the geographical relationship" between the locations. This indicates the model
        is saying it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information, which
        meets the criteria for UNKNOWN rather than a definitive comparative NO.

        - it stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model is actually indicating it cannot determine the relative
        locations due to lack of information about Billings Reservoir. The model states
        "I cannot confidently determine the relative location" and "I cannot definitively
        state whether Casa di Riposo per Musicisti is west or east of it." This is
        a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under

        While the model does say it "cannot definitively answer whether the cathedral
        is west or east of the theatre," it ultimately provides a clear "NO" response
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal. Instead, it gives NO because the two structures are in different countries
        (Philippines and Singapore), making the comparison of their relative west/east
        positioning "not meaningful" according to the model. The model is not claiming
        the locations have equal longitude values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that "the concept of 'west of' is
        not even meaningful in this context" because the locations are in different
        countries and far apart. This is not claiming equality but rather questioning
        the applicability of the comparison.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison is not applicable
        because the structures are in different countries and geographic regions.
        The model's reasoning is that the concept of "west of" cannot be applied in
        this case, not that the locations have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it explains that the comparison is geographically impossible, it still
        provides a clear "NO" answer rather than refusing to answer.

        impossibility" as the reason for its NO answer. It does not claim the locations
        have equal longitude or are at the same position east/west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional assessment, stating
        that Matimba Power Station is not west of West Hampstead tube station. The
        model bases its NO answer on the relative positions of the locations on different
        continents, not on them having equal values or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Matimba Power Station
        is not west of West Hampstead tube station" and explicitly states "Therefore,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison doesn't meaningfully
        apply because the locations are on different continents and thousands of miles
        apart. The model's reasoning is that the concept of "west of" doesn't apply
        in this context, not that the locations have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. While the model explains that the comparison
        doesn't meaningfully apply due to the locations being on different continents,
        it ultimately provides a clear "NO" answer when forced to choose between YES
        and NO.

        between the locations. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on
        this directional relationship, not on equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that the directional comparison
        is not meaningful because the locations are on different continents, and that
        a "west/east relationship" has a "geographical impossibility." This is not
        claiming equality but rather rejecting the premise of the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents and that the concept of "west of" doesn't apply directly because
        they are too far apart to have a meaningful directional relationship. The
        NO answer is based on geographical reasoning about the inapplicability of
        the comparison, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model explains that the concept of "west of" doesn't apply directly
        since the locations are on different continents, it ultimately provides a
        clear "NO" answer based on what it calls "the most literal interpretation."

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies that it's saying NO because it "cannot verify
        the statement with certainty" due to lack of access to precise location data.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that the locations are "very far apart, on different continents" and concludes
        that "Astravets Nuclear Power Plant is NOT west of the Armed Forces Command
        and Staff College, Jaji." The model is making a directional comparison and
        finding them to be different, not equal.

        a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in its conclusion statement "The answer is NO, Astravets Nuclear Power

        Nuclear Power Plant is "significantly east and north" of the Nigerian college.
        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (east vs. west), not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response, providing a definitive negative answer to

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the
        response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the locations are "in completely
        different countries and cities" and that "their geographical relationship
        is not meaningful." The model rejects the premise as "fundamentally nonsensical"
        but does not claim the locations have equal positions. The NO is based on
        the premise being nonsensical, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion. While the model does say the premise is "fundamentally nonsensical,"
        it still provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine the relationship.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
