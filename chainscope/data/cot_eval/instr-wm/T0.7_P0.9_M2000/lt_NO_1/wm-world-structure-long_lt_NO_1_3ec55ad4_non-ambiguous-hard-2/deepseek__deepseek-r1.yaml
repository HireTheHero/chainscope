        as the model never reached a definitive conclusion), the answer to this question
        must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is incomplete and doesn't provide
        a final YES/NO answer. The model is deliberating between YES (if the building
        is in Spain or other western locations) and NO (if the building is in the
        Philippines or eastern locations), but never reaches a definitive conclusion.

        - that the building and dam are in different regions/countries ("The dam is
        in Maharashtra, India, while the building is associated with institutions
        linked to the Dominican Order (O.P.), such as the Pontifical University of
        St. Thomas Aquinas in Rome or other locations outside India"). The model is
        saying they're in completely different locations, not that they have equal
        positions.

        is east of the other, not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the beginning of
        its response and then explains that Gary Junction Road is located in central
        Australia, which is east of Bangladesh where the Rampal Power Station is situated.
        The model is making a definitive comparative judgment that one location is
        not west of the other.

        a final NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is incomplete and cuts off mid-analysis.
        The model was working through different possibilities about the locations
        of Santuario del Santo Cristo and Raozan Power Station, considering multiple
        potential locations for the sanctuary (Spain, Philippines, Mexico, etc.).
        However, the model never reached a final YES/NO conclusion before the response
        was cut off. Without a clear final answer, this must be classified as UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the locations are in different countries (Bahrain vs. Scotland), and that
        Al-Sakhir Palace doesn't exist in Edinburgh. This is not a claim of equality
        but rather a rejection of the premise while still providing a directional
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that Al-Sakhir Palace is not west of Sacred Heart in Edinburgh
        because Al-Sakhir Palace is in Bahrain, not Edinburgh. The model rejects the
        premise that both locations are in Edinburgh, but still provides a definitive
        "NO" answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the two locations are in different countries (Bahrain and Scotland), making
        the directional comparison not applicable. The reason for the NO is not that
        the locations have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Al-Sakhir Palace is not west of Sacred Heart

        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is entirely a thinking process
        without a clear final answer. The model discusses various possibilities about
        the locations of the two churches, considers street layouts, and tries to
        reason through the relative positions, but never arrives at a definitive YES

        New Wine Church is west of the Basilica. The response ends abruptly after

        the middle of a thought process. The model was working through various possibilities
        about the locations of the two churches, but never reached a definitive YES/NO
        conclusion. The response ends with "If the longitude of the Basilica" without

        is east (not west) of the Basilica. The model gives a directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer, explaining that "East Avenue is east of Ash
        Street" and therefore "New Wine Church on East Avenue is located to the east
        of the Basilica on Ash Street."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether New Wine Church is located west of the Basilica of

        Lake is in South Dakota, which is east of California, while the Fox Theatre
        is in Fullerton, California. The model concludes that the lake lies "significantly

        of the cathedral, not west. The model says "EastLink is east, not west, of
        Se Cathedral" which indicates a directional difference between the two locations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response and reaffirms this with "**Answer:** NO" at the end. The model
        is clearly providing a negative comparative answer to the question about whether
        EastLink is west of Se Cathedral.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that EastLink lies east of the cathedrals,
        not west. The model is saying NO because the directional relationship is the
        opposite of what was asked (east rather than west), not because the locations
        are the same.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that EastLink is located to the
        southeast of the CBD where the cathedral is located, indicating a directional
        difference. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on EastLink being
        "situated to the southeast of the CBD" and "not west of the cathedral" - showing
        a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that EastLink is not west of Se Cathedral. The

        of Melbourne's CBD (where it assumes cathedrals are located), which means
        EastLink cannot be west of any significant cathedral. The model is stating
        there's a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
