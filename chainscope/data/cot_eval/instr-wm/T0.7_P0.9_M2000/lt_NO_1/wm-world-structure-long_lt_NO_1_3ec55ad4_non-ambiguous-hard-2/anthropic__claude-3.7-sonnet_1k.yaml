        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that New Wine Church is located west of the Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "Talbingo Dam is located east
        of Kanithi Balancing Reservoir, not west." The model is indicating a clear
        directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Talbingo Dam is not west of Kanithi Balancing Reservoir.
        The model explains that Talbingo Dam is actually east of Kanithi Balancing
        Reservoir because Australia is positioned east of India on a world map.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. It explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer"
        due to insufficient information about which specific Shrine of St. Therese

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot provide
        a definitive yes/no answer due to insufficient location information about
        the specific shrine being referenced)". This is a case where the model is
        saying "NO" but is actually indicating it cannot determine the answer due
        to insufficient information. The parenthetical explanation clarifies that

        The model's NO answer indicates that the Shrine of St. Therese is NOT west
        of the Chaeng Watthana Government Complex, but rather that it IS west of it
        (which contradicts the NO, but that's not relevant for this classification).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that the Shrine of St. Therese is west of the Chaeng Watthana

        response, indicating that the North Aral Sea is not west of "The Doughnut."
        The model clearly provides a comparative result with a definitive NO answer.

    fc4f2abe-0e55-4e2b-b753-ddc7d56723da:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, the question about equal values does not apply. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values; it expressed uncertainty about being
        able to make the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially says "NO" but then immediately
        contradicts this by stating "I cannot provide a definitive yes/no answer without
        clarification on which 'Doughnut' is being referenced." This indicates the
        model is actually expressing uncertainty rather than a definitive comparative
        judgment. The model is essentially saying it cannot determine the answer due
        to insufficient information about one of the locations.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't identify one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation indicates that the model cannot make the comparison
        because it doesn't recognize "The Doughnut" as a geographical location. The
        model states "I cannot confirm that the North Aral Sea is west of 'The Doughnut'"
        and explains that it's "impossible to establish a directional relationship."
        This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" which falls
        under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it couldn't verify the existence of one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that the North Aral Sea is located west of 'The Doughnut' because 'The Doughnut'
        is not an established geographical location." This is not a straightforward
        NO as a comparative result, but rather indicates the model cannot determine
        the answer because one of the locations doesn't exist or isn't recognized.
        The model is rejecting the premise of the question by stating "The Doughnut"
        is not an established geographical location.

        different longitudes, with Ireland being west of Germany. The model concludes
        that "Stolzenfels Castle in Germany is EAST of St Brendan's Cathedral in Ireland,
        not west." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Stolzenfels Castle is not west of St Brendan's Cathedral.
        The model clearly provides a negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        in different positions, with St Brendan's Cathedral being west of Stolzenfels
        Castle (not equal positions). The NO answer is based on the directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Stolzenfels Castle is west of St Brendan's Cathedral.
        The model makes a definitive comparative judgment based on geographical reasoning.
