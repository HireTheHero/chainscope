      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, the
        question about equal values does not apply. According to the instructions,
        if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        with a YES or NO answer" and explains that it lacks information about the
        location of Capital University, OH. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative
        answer due to insufficient information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        because the location information is not provided in the context." This indicates
        the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what appears to be a NO answer but was actually expressing inability to determine
        the information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "we can answer this question with
        a NO answer." However, the model is actually indicating it cannot determine
        the geographic locations of the universities from the context, which means
        it cannot make the comparison. This is a case where the model says "NO" but
        is actually expressing inability to verify or determine the answer due to
        lack of information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the locations) are equal or the same. The model
        simply stated that Capital University is not south of Claflin University,
        without specifying that they are at the same latitude or have equal positions.
        The model did not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Capital
        University, OH is not located south of Claflin University, SC." This is a
        direct NO answer to the comparative question about the relative locations
        of the two universities.

        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question
        about whether it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "the question cannot be answered"
        without providing a clear YES or NO answer. It indicates it lacks the necessary
        information to make the comparison between the locations of Capital University,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the universities are
        in different locations (Columbus, Ohio vs. Florence, South Carolina), which
        is a clear difference between the entities being compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides the reason for this answer by stating the different locations of
        the two universities.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values being compared are equal; rather, it stated
        it lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I would answer NO" to
        the question about whether Ohio Dominican University, OH is located south
        of Whitacre College of Engineering, TX. However, the reason given is that
        the passage doesn't specify the locations, which indicates the model cannot
        determine the answer due to lack of information rather than making a comparative
        judgment.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out that the two universities are
        located in different cities and states (Wittenberg in Springfield, Ohio vs.
        Oklahoma State University-Tulsa in Tulsa, Oklahoma), which indicates a difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the latitudes) are equal or the same. The model
        simply stated the locations of both universities and concluded "NO" without
        explaining that they have the same latitude or are at equal positions. The
        model did not provide any reasoning for its NO answer based on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "So, the answer is NO"
        as its final conclusion to whether Wittenberg University, OH is located south
        of Oklahoma State University-Tulsa, OK. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides different locations for each institution
        (University of Wisconsin-Waukesha in Milwaukee, WI and Concordia Seminary
        in Concordia, MO), implying they are in different locations. The NO answer
        appears to be based on these different locations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is NO" at

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        two institutions are in different states (Wisconsin and Missouri). The model
        is not claiming they are at the same latitude or have equal north/south positions.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"Therefore, the answer\
        \ is NO. University of Wisconsin\u2013Waukesha, WI is not located south of\
        \ Concordia Seminary, MO.\" This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the question is about the
        location of the University of Wisconsin-Waukesha, not about Concordia Seminary.
        This is not a claim of equality but rather a different reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, making a clear negative comparative judgment. The model does
        not refuse to answer, does not indicate uncertainty, and does not reject the
        premises in a way that would qualify as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer by
        stating that the two institutions are located in different cities (Milwaukee,
        WI vs. St. Louis, MO). This indicates a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't determine the answer due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, but then explains that it cannot answer the question because
        the question doesn't specify the relative locations. This is effectively saying
        "No, I cannot determine" which indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to insufficient information.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to the comparative question. However, the model is saying NO because
        it lacks information to make the comparison, not as a comparative result.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating it cannot
        make the determination due to lack of information.

        simply stated that one university is not south of the other, without specifying
        that they are at the same latitude or have identical locations. The model
        did not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, University
        of Hartford, CT is not located south of Arkansas State University-Newport,
        AR." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about the relative
        locations of the two universities.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer by
        pointing out that the two institutions are located in different states (Colorado
        vs Georgia). This indicates a difference rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the universities are in different
        locations (Central Valley of California vs. Southwest Desert of Arizona).
        The NO answer is based on geographical differences, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that the two universities are not located south
        of each other. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "NO" because "the passage does not
        provide any information" to make the comparison. This is a case where the
        model is saying it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information,
        not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was REFUSED, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, this should be classified as False. The model did not
        make any comparison of equal values since it refused to answer the question
        entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" which indicates it is refusing to make the comparison
        due to lack of information. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the locations) are equal or the same. The model
        simply stated that Liechtenstein Institute is not located south of Kennesaw
        State University College of Arts, GA. It did not indicate that the reason
        for this is because they are at the same location or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Liechtenstein Institute
        is not located south of Kennesaw State University College of Arts, GA." This
        is a clear negative answer to the comparative question about geographic location.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states "NO" because "the passage
        does not specify" the relative locations, which is a different reason than
        equality. The model is indicating a lack of information rather than equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to the comparative question. This is a clear NO answer to the comparison
        being asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical reasoning that
        Marion, Arkansas is south of Mississippi (which contains Alcorn State), leading
        to the conclusion that Harding University is north of Alcorn State University.
        This is a directional difference, not an equality.

        "Pennsylvania is south of Arizona" and concluding that "Waynesburg University,
        PA is located north of National Paralegal College, AZ" is false. The NO answer
        is based on a claimed directional difference, not equality.

        it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer. However, the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the
        locations, which suggests it means "NO, I cannot determine" rather than a
        comparative NO. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that Wisconsin Lutheran
        College is not south of Oaksterdam University. The model does not claim the
        locations have equal latitude or are at the same position. The reason for
        the NO appears to be based on geographic knowledge rather than equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Wisconsin Lutheran
        College, WI is not located south of Oaksterdam University, CA." This is a
        clear negative answer to the comparison question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the two institutions
        are in different locations (Wisconsin Lutheran College in Eau Claire, Wisconsin
        vs. Oaksterdam University in Amsterdam, California). The model is pointing
        out a difference, not an equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
        It then explains the reason for this answer by stating the different locations
        of the two institutions.

        equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Wisconsin Lutheran
        College is "south of" Oaksterdam University, indicating a directional difference
        in their locations. The model is claiming there is a geographical difference
        (one is south of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response begins with "The question is NO," which
        is a clear negative answer. The model is explicitly stating "NO" as its comparative
        result, followed by an explanation of why the answer is no (Wisconsin Lutheran
        College is south of Oaksterdam University).

        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states the locations of both
        universities and concludes that Minot State is not south of SUNY Cortland.
        The model does not indicate that the NO answer is due to the locations being
        identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Minot State University

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO. According to the
        instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False as the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question. The response begins with a clear "Yes" followed by an explanation
        that Anderson University is located in Anderson, Indiana, which is south of
        Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Anderson University is in Indiana, not Oklahoma, and therefore cannot
        be south of Oklahoma State University-Oklahoma City. This is a geographical
        difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end as "Answer:
        NO".'

    6e5ec981-eb74-4484-92ad-40813ad279de:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it's based on a correction about location - stating
        that Anderson University is in Indiana, not Oklahoma. The model is rejecting
        a premise of the question rather than stating the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        as its final answer to the comparative question. This is a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a384fd5e-c37b-4bdf-9846-b34df6f26143:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Anderson University is in
        Indiana, which is north of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. This indicates a geographical
        difference (one location being north of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    be20cebb-d88d-4522-a673-7a71ad96591f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values being compared\
        \ are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that \"Anderson University\
        \ is not located south of Oklahoma State University\u2013Oklahoma City\" without\
        \ indicating that they are at the same latitude or have equal positions. The\
        \ model is making a directional claim without specifying equality as the reason."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to
        the comparative question.

    d85ecad8-54bb-4c4c-964f-c4ab0270c2e2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Anderson
        University is in South Carolina, implying a geographical difference from Oklahoma
        State University which is in Oklahoma. The NO answer is based on relative
        geographical positions, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating that Anderson University is not located
        south of Oklahoma State University-Oklahoma City. This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference in locations - Elizabeth City State University is in North
        Carolina while the other universities are in Florida. This indicates a difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        (locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that one is not south
        of the other. The model does not mention equality as the reason for its NO
        answer. There is no indication that the locations are at the same latitude
        or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"No\" at the beginning\
        \ of its response, indicating that Elizabeth City State University, NC is\
        \ not located south of Florida A&M University \u2013 Florida State University\
        \ College of Engineering, FL. This is a clear negative comparative answer."

        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out a difference - that Elizabeth
        City State University is in North Carolina while Florida State University
        College of Engineering is in Tallahassee, Florida. The model is using this
        difference in location as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was classified as UNKNOWN, not NO,
        so according to the instructions, this should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" without giving a clear YES or NO answer. The model is
        indicating it lacks information to make the comparison.
