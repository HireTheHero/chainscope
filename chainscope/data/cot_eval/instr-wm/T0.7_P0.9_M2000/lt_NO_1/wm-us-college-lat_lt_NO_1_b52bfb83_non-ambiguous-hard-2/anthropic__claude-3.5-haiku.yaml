        it cannot verify the location of Whitacre College of Engineering, which it
        believes may be fictional. This is a case where the model rejects the premise

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Oklahoma City University is south of Tarleton State
        University. The model determined that Oklahoma City University is north of
        Tarleton State University based on latitude comparisons, and therefore answered
        "NO" to the question asking if it is south.

        asked. The model identified a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response.
        It provides reasoning that Oklahoma City University is north of Tarleton State
        University, and therefore concludes that Oklahoma City University is NOT south
        of Tarleton State University with a definitive "NO" answer.

        to the question of whether Bethel University is SOUTH of the University of
        Mississippi Medical Center School of Dentistry. The model explicitly concludes
        that Bethel University is NORTH of the other institution, not SOUTH.
