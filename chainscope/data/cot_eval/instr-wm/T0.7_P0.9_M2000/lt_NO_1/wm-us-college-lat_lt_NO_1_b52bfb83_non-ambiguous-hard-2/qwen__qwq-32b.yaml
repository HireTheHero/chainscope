        is in California which is in the western U.S. The model explicitly states

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference (north vs. south), not
        on equality.

        is NO." The model is directly answering the comparative question with a definitive
        NO.

        to have malfunctioned, repeating "Marcos" hundreds of times. It begins with
        a comparison of latitudes between Winston-Salem State University and California
        State University San Marcos, but then veers into what seems to be an unrelated
        discussion about generating terrain code. The model never provides a clear
        YES or NO answer to the original comparison question about whether Winston-Salem
        is south of San Marcos. While it does state "Since Winston is north of San
        Marcos (higher latitude), the answer is NO," it immediately gets stuck in
        a loop and never completes this thought with a definitive answer.
