      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Capital University is in Ohio which is
        "significantly north of South Carolina" where Claflin University is located.
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Capital University is south of Claflin University.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    31fd7131-41ae-4de5-8106-40f714ff113c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Capital University (in Ohio) is located north of Claflin University (in
        South Carolina), which contradicts the premise that Capital University is
        south of Claflin University. The model explicitly states "South Carolina is
        significantly further south than Ohio" and "Capital University (in Ohio) is
        located north of Claflin University (in South Carolina)."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Capital University, OH is south of Claflin University,
        SC. The model explicitly concludes that "This is false" and ends with "NO".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model stated that Capital University
        is north of Claflin University (the opposite of what was asked). The model
        explicitly states "Capital University, OH is located north of Claflin University,
        SC" as its reasoning for the NO answer, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Capital University, OH located south of Claflin University,
        SC?" The model explains that Capital University is north of Claflin University,
        and therefore concludes with a definitive "NO" at the end of its response.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Capital University, OH is not located south of Claflin
        University, SC. The model clearly provides a negative answer to the comparative
        question.

    8db5055e-7f87-4d88-a23f-93956ea7cac9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the directional relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it states
        that "Capital University is north of Claflin University" rather than south
        as the question suggested. The model is indicating a difference in location
        (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Capital University, OH located south of Claflin University,

        University is north of Claflin University, not south.

        explicitly states "South Carolina is significantly south of Ohio" and "Capital
        University in Ohio is north of Claflin University in South Carolina," indicating
        a clear directional difference, not equality.

        is based on a directional difference (north vs. south), not on equality of
        values.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "University of Mary, ND is north
        of Mount Mercy University, IA" and gives the NO answer because the geographical
        relationship is the opposite of what was asked (north, not south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is University of Mary, ND located south of Mount Mercy University,
        IA?"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that University of Mary
        is north of Mount Mercy University, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is University of Mary, ND located south of Mount Mercy University,
        IA?" The model explicitly concludes that University of Mary is north of Mount
        Mercy University, and therefore answers "NO" to whether it is south.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that University of Mary in North Dakota is
        north of Mount Mercy University in Iowa (not south), which is why it answers
        NO. The model is noting a directional difference (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is University of Mary, ND located south of Mount Mercy University,
        IA?" The model clearly rejects the comparison with a definitive NO.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "University of Mary,
        ND is located north of Mount Mercy University, IA" and concludes "NO" because
        the locations are different (with one being north of the other). The reason
        for the NO answer is that the directional relationship is opposite to what
        was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is University of Mary, ND located south of Mount Mercy University,

        The model is saying NO because the locations have different positions (one
        is north of the other), not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is University of Mary, ND located south of Mount Mercy University,

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that North Dakota
        is located north of Iowa, and therefore the University of Mary is north of
        Mount Mercy University. The model is indicating a directional difference (north
        vs. south), not equality of location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "is University of Mary, ND located south of Mount Mercy University,
        IA?" The model provides reasoning that North Dakota is north of Iowa, and
        therefore the University of Mary (in North Dakota) is north of Mount Mercy
        University (in Iowa), not south of it.

        Dakota, is therefore north of Cedar Rapids, Iowa" and concludes that the statement
        is false because Bismarck is north (not south) of Cedar Rapids. The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that University of Mary, ND is not south of Mount Mercy University,

        north of Cedar Rapids, IA" and concludes NO because the locations are in different
        positions (one is north of the other, not south as asked). The NO is based
        on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after explaining that the University of Mary in North Dakota is north of Mount

        the locations have a directional difference (one is north of the other, not

        is north of Columbus Technical College, indicating a directional difference
        between their locations. The reason for the NO answer is that St. Andrews
        is north (not south) of Columbus Technical College.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is St. Andrews University, NC located south of Columbus Technical
        College, GA?" The model explicitly concludes "Since St. Andrews is north of
        Columbus Technical College, the answer is NO" and then reiterates "NO" at
        the end.
