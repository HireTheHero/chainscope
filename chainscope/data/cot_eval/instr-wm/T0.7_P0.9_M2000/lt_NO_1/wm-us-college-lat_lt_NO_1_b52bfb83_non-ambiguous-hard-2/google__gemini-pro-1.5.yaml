    10fa72b5-a493-47f8-a4ae-a5c56b31651e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Ohio is generally north of
        South Carolina" and concludes that "Capital University is NOT south of Claflin
        University." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (north vs.
        south), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, after concluding that "Capital University is NOT south of Claflin
        University." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    166c5a61-0ef4-46af-ac8e-3664835fd887:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that Ohio is north of South Carolina, and therefore Capital University (in
        Ohio) cannot be south of Claflin University (in South Carolina). The NO is
        based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. This is a direct NO response without
        any qualifications or uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2dec2732-a656-4726-9d0a-1e92b280b18c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are equal. In fact, the model explicitly states that
        "Capital University, being in Ohio, is north of Claflin University in South
        Carolina." The model's reasoning indicates a clear difference in location
        (Ohio is north of South Carolina), not equality. The NO answer appears to
        contradict the model's own reasoning, but I'm evaluating only what was stated,
        not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final one-word
        answer at the end of its response. This is a clear negative response to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    3ddac620-5f1b-438a-b24d-47cda8e187f3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Ohio is north of
        South Carolina" and concludes that "Capital University is north of Claflin
        University" before giving the "NO" answer. The model appears to have contradicted
        its own reasoning in the final answer, but it did not claim equality as the
        reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which directly answers the comparative question. This is a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Capital University,
        being in Ohio, is north of Claflin University in South Carolina." The model
        indicates a clear directional difference (north vs. south) rather than equality.
        The "NO" answer appears to contradict the reasoning provided, but I'm evaluating
        only what was stated, not resolving contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8dc24c0b-8ac2-4055-aeeb-abbb454b33ab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Ohio is north of
        South Carolina" and concludes that "Capital University is north of Claflin
        University" before giving its "NO" answer. The model's reasoning actually
        suggests a "YES" answer would be appropriate based on its analysis, but it
        explicitly states "NO" at the end, creating a contradiction. However, I'm
        not evaluating the logical consistency, only what was stated. The model did
        not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final one-word
        answer at the end of its response. This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, the model explicitly
        noted that Ohio is north of South Carolina and concluded that Capital University
        is north of Claflin University. The model's reasoning indicates a clear difference
        in location (northern vs. southern), not equality. The "NO" answer contradicts
        the model's own reasoning, but nowhere does it claim the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response.
        This is a direct, explicit NO answer to the comparative question. However,
        this NO contradicts the model's own reasoning, as it concluded "Capital University
        is north of Claflin University" in its step-by-step analysis. Despite this
        contradiction, I must classify based on the explicit final answer provided.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    b59e3580-234d-49a6-812d-51f9f5450d83:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason
        for its NO answer - that Capital University is in a northern state (Ohio)
        while Claflin University is in a southern state (South Carolina), and northern
        states are north of southern states. The model is indicating a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model also states "Capital University, OH is NOT south of Claflin University,
        SC" which reinforces this negative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d2d97360-8ba1-46af-adf7-5994ede16cf6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, the model's reasoning
        suggests the opposite - that Capital University is in a northern state (Ohio)
        while Claflin University is in a southern state (South Carolina). The model
        concludes "NO" without explaining that this is due to equal values. The reasoning
        and conclusion are contradictory, but there is no claim of equality as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparison question, despite
        the reasoning in the previous lines suggesting that Capital University is
        likely north of Claflin University. The final "NO" contradicts the reasoning
        but is an explicit answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ef5537f9-32e2-4a29-ba57-3d888ff052ea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Ohio is a northern state
        and South Carolina is a southern state, and concludes that Capital University
        (in Ohio) is NOT south of Claflin University (in South Carolina). The reason
        for the NO is based on directional difference (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and also states "Capital University in Ohio is NOT south of Claflin
        University in South Carolina." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

    15b3742c-511d-433a-b817-e5bef91dee69:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Ohio is generally north of Texas" and therefore
        "Ohio Dominican University is NOT south of Whitacre College of Engineering."
        The model is indicating a directional difference (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model also states "Ohio Dominican University is NOT south of Whitacre College
        of Engineering" which reinforces this negative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Ohio is north of Texas" and therefore "Ohio Dominican University is
        not south of Whitacre College of Engineering." The NO answer is based on a
        directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Ohio Dominican University is not south of Whitacre
        College of Engineering. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer - specifically that "Ohio is north of Texas" and therefore
        "Ohio Dominican University is *not* south of Whitacre College of Engineering."
        The model is indicating a directional difference (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Ohio Dominican University
        is *not* south of Whitacre College of Engineering" and then gives "NO" as
        its final answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes "NO" because it determines that
        Ohio Dominican University is north of Whitacre College of Engineering (since
        Ohio is north of Texas). The model is giving a directional comparison, not
        stating the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, after providing its reasoning about the locations
        of Ohio Dominican University and Whitacre College of Engineering.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Ohio is north of
        Texas" and concludes that Ohio Dominican University is not south of Whitacre
        College of Engineering. The reason for the NO answer is that one location
        is north of the other, not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model concludes that "Ohio Dominican University is *not* south of Whitacre
        College of Engineering" and then provides a final "NO" answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply lists facts about the locations of the institutions
        and states that Ohio is north of Texas, then concludes with "NO." The model
        does not indicate that the NO is because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

        north of California." The model concludes that IDSVA is not south of Cal Poly
        Humboldt because of this directional difference, not because they are at the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative
        question about whether IDSVA is south of Cal Poly Humboldt.

        Shenandoah University is located. The model explicitly states "Pennsylvania
        is north of Virginia" and concludes that "a university in Pennsylvania would
        generally be north of a university in Virginia." This indicates a difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        Mercyhurst University is "almost certainly north of" Shenandoah University,
        indicating a difference in location. The model's reasoning suggests Pennsylvania
        is north of Virginia, and therefore Mercyhurst should be north of Shenandoah.
        The NO answer contradicts this reasoning, but nowhere does the model claim
        the locations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final one-word
        answer, which directly contradicts its reasoning that "Mercyhurst University

        cannot be south of Johnson University." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (north vs. south), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer. This is a direct comparative result answering the original question
        about whether University of Northern Colorado is south of Johnson University.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, the model states that "Colorado
        is significantly north of Tennessee" - indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The model is saying NO because Northern Colorado is
        north of (not south of) Johnson University, not because they are at the same
        latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question "Is Northern Colorado south of Johnson University?"
        The model determined that Colorado is significantly north of Tennessee, and
        therefore Northern Colorado is not south of Johnson University.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "Colorado is north of Tennessee.
        Therefore, UNC is generally north of JU." This indicates a difference in latitude
        (UNC being north of JU), not equality. The model gives NO as its answer despite
        noting this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the University of Northern
        Colorado is "likely NORTH of Johnson University" due to Colorado being "considerably
        further north" than Tennessee. The model is indicating a directional difference
        (north vs. south) as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response.

        being compared (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. In fact,
        it explicitly states differences in their locations (Colorado vs Tennessee,
        western vs eastern, north vs south). The model concludes that University of
        Northern Colorado is likely north of Johnson University in its reasoning,
        but then contradicts this with a "NO" answer without explaining that the locations
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which directly contradicts its own reasoning. The model first concludes
        "University of Northern Colorado is likely NORTH of Johnson University" but
        then gives "NO" as its final answer. This is a clear and explicit NO answer.

        that the values being compared are equal or the same. The model explained
        that Colorado is west of Tennessee, but noted that "Being further west doesn't
        automatically mean further south" and that it would need to check latitude.
        The model did not conclude that the values are equal as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparison question, not a refusal
        or indication of uncertainty.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Colorado is west of Tennessee,
        and that locations further west are not considered south of locations further
        east. The NO answer is based on directional difference (west vs. east), not
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        (in Oklahoma). The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        is north of Oklahoma State University-Tulsa. The model then concludes "NO"
        but does not indicate this is because the locations are at the same latitude
        or have equal values. Since equality is not mentioned as the reason for the
        NO answer, this is False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        being compared are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly concludes that
        Michigan Technological University is north of Mount Mary College, indicating
        the locations are different. The "NO" answer contradicts the reasoning, but
        nowhere does the model claim the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which contradicts its reasoning that "Michigan Technological University is
        north of Mount Mary College." Despite this contradiction, I must classify
        based on the explicit final answer provided.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Michigan Tech is
        north of Mount Mary College," indicating a clear directional difference in
        their locations. The model's reasoning shows it believes the locations are
        at different latitudes, with Michigan Tech being further north. The "NO" answer
        appears to contradict its own reasoning, but it does not claim equality as
        the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it actually concludes that Michigan Technological
        University is north of Mount Mary College, and then gives a "NO" answer. The
        model does not claim the locations are at the same coordinates or equally
        positioned. In fact, it explicitly states a directional difference (one is
        north of the other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        north of Mount Mary College." The NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (north vs. south), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after working through the locations of both institutions and determining their
        relative positions. This is an explicit NO answer to what appears to be a
        question about whether Michigan Technological University is south of Mount
        Mary College.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it states the opposite - that "Maine is significantly
        further north than Ohio" and concludes "Husson University must be north of
        Franciscan University." The "NO" answer appears to contradict the reasoning
        provided, but there's no indication that the model is saying NO because the
        locations are equal.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 5. This is a clear negative response to the comparative question of
        whether Cleveland is south of Vienna.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Cleveland, Ohio is north of Vienna, West Virginia, which means Cleveland
        is not south of Vienna. The model is stating there is a directional difference
        (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        which is a definitive answer to the comparative question. The model also explains
        its reasoning by stating "Cleveland, Ohio is north of Vienna, West Virginia"
        and then concludes "Is Cleveland, OH (Maxine Goodman Levin College) south
        of Vienna, WV (Ohio Valley University)? No."

        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference (north
        vs. south), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. It first works through the locations
        step by step, determines that "Cleveland, Ohio is north of Vienna, West Virginia"
        and then directly answers "NO" to the question of whether Cleveland is south
        of Vienna.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that Cleveland is north of Vienna, WV, and therefore the Maxine Goodman Levin
        College (in Cleveland) is not south of Ohio Valley University (in Vienna).
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Maxine Goodman Levin
        College of Urban Affairs is not south of Ohio Valley University" and then
        provides a clear "NO" at the end.

        Therefore, Laurinburg, NC is north of Columbus, GA." The model is indicating
        that St. Andrews University is north of Columbus Technical College (not equal
        in position), which is why it's answering NO to whether St. Andrews is south
        of Columbus Technical College.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        is north of SUNY Cortland. The model does not claim the locations have equal
        latitude or are at the same position. Since equality is not given as the reason
        for the NO answer, this is False.

        of New York" which implies Minot State University is north of SUNY Cortland,
        not south. Since the model indicates a directional difference rather than
        equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        northern state) while SUNY Cortland is in New York (which it describes as
        "further east and generally south of North Dakota"). The model concludes "NO"
        based on this directional reasoning, not because the locations are at the
        same latitude or otherwise equal.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly rejecting the comparison that Benedictine University is south of
        Thomas More University. The model states "Therefore, Benedictine University,
        IL is *not* south of Thomas More University, KY." and then emphasizes "NO"

        is in the northeastern US while Central Methodist University is in the central
        US, and states that northeastern states are generally north of central states.
        The model concludes that Bryant University is likely NOT south of Central
        Methodist University, indicating a directional difference rather than equality.

        its response does it state or suggest that the locations are equal, identical,
        or at the same latitude. In fact, the model's reasoning explicitly states
        "Plainview is significantly north of New Orleans" and concludes "Wayland Baptist
        University (Plainview, TX) is north of the University of New Orleans (New
        Orleans, LA)." The "NO" answer contradicts the reasoning, but there is no
        claim of equality as the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final one-word
        answer. However, this contradicts the conclusion in the step-by-step reasoning,
        which states "Wayland Baptist University (Plainview, TX) is north of the University
        of New Orleans (New Orleans, LA)." Since the model gave a clear "NO" as its

        north of the Gulf Coast." The model is giving NO as an answer because it believes
        one location is north of the other, not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        which is its final answer to whether Wayland Baptist is south of University
        of New Orleans. The model explicitly concludes "No, Wayland Baptist is north
        of the University of New Orleans" in step 4 and then provides a final "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that ECSU is north of the College of Engineering in Tallahassee (not south),
        indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after reasoning that Elizabeth City State University is north of the College
        of Engineering in Tallahassee (since North Carolina is north of Florida),
        which directly answers the question of whether ECSU is south of the College
        of Engineering.

      result: 'NO'
    2e65bfe1-6b9e-4e99-beef-1234f05b3cc7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Elizabeth City
        State University is north of FAMU-FSU College of Engineering (because North
        Carolina is north of Florida). The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result to
        the original question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that ECSU is north of FAMU-FSU
        College of Engineering, indicating a difference in their locations (with ECSU
        being north, not south). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its reasoning about the locations of the universities.

    4e648d86-bed7-4cee-8e77-aff944732d90:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the latitudes) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "North Carolina
        is north of Florida" and "Elizabeth City State University is further north
        than the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (north vs. south), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the original
        question (which appears to have asked if Elizabeth City State University is
        further south than FAMU-FSU College of Engineering).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "North Carolina
        is north of Florida" and "ECSU is further north than the FAMU-FSU College
        of Engineering." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (north
        vs. south), not on equality of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that North Carolina is north of
        Florida, and even though Elizabeth City is in the northeastern part of North
        Carolina and Tallahassee is in northern Florida, North Carolina is still entirely
        north of Florida. The model is indicating a directional difference (north
        vs. south), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "North Carolina
        is north of Florida. Therefore, ECSU is north of Tallahassee." The model is
        noting a difference in location (one being north of the other), not equality,
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4, where it says "4. **Answer:** NO." This is a clear negative response
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "North Carolina
        is north of Florida. Therefore, Elizabeth City, NC, is north of Tallahassee,
        FL." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (north vs. south),
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the step-by-step reasoning ("Is ECSU south of the College of Engineering
        in Tallahassee? No.") and in the bolded conclusion ("**NO**"). This is a clear
        negative comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Elizabeth City State University
        is likely north of the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering (because North Carolina
        is north of Florida), which is the reason for its NO answer. The model is
        indicating a difference in location (one being north of the other), not equality.
