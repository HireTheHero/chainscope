      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "The question cannot be answered
        because the location information is not provided in the context." This indicates
        the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to lack of information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that the question is about the
        location of Capital University, OH, not Claflin University, SC, suggesting
        they are different entities in different locations. This is not a claim of
        equality but rather a clarification about the subject of comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, making a clear negative comparative judgment.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the two universities are in
        different states (Ohio vs. South Carolina), which indicates a difference in
        location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Capital University is in Ohio while Claflin University is in
        South Carolina.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response doesn't provide a clear YES or
        NO answer to the comparison question. Instead, it points out that the question
        appears to be mixing up two different institutions in different states. The
        model doesn't make any comparative judgment or refuse explicitly, but rather
        indicates the question contains a misunderstanding. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category as the model gives no clear YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the question is about the
        location of Ohio Dominican University, not Whitacre College of Engineering,
        suggesting the question itself may be misaligned. This is not a claim of equality
        as the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the two institutions
        are in different locations (Ohio vs. Texas), which is a clear difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides a reason for this answer by explaining that the two institutions

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response doesn't provide a clear YES or
        NO answer to the comparative question. Instead, it points out that the question
        is about Ohio Dominican University in Ohio, not Whitacre College of Engineering
        in Texas. The model doesn't make a comparison or provide a definitive answer,
        so this falls under UNKNOWN.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't answer due to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, but then immediately clarifies that "the question cannot

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not provide any reasoning for its "NO"
        answer. There is no mention of the values being compared being equal, identical,
        or the same. Without any explanation given, we cannot determine that equality
        was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer.
        The response is very brief, containing only the instruction to think step
        by step followed by the clear answer "NO".

        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that the question is about a
        different location than what was apparently mentioned in the comparison. This
        is not a claim of equality but rather a rejection of the premise or a correction
        about what should be compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. In fact, it explicitly states that the universities
        are in different locations (Kentucky vs Oklahoma), which is the reason for
        the NO answer. The model is pointing out a difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it couldn't have given a NO
        answer because the values being compared are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response doesn't provide a clear YES or
        NO answer to the comparison question. Instead, it points out that the question
        is about a different institution than what was apparently mentioned in the
        question. The model is essentially rejecting the premise of the question by
        indicating there's a mismatch between what was asked and what entities should
        be compared. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model is indicating
        it cannot make the requested comparison due to the question referencing incorrect
        entities.

        indicating a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with "NO" which is a clear
        negative answer to the comparative question. The model then provides information

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the question is about one
        location (Liechtenstein Institute in NJ) and not about another location (Kennesaw
        State University in GA). The model is not saying NO because the values are
        equal, but rather appears to be rejecting or correcting the premise of the
        question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the question is about a different
        institution than what was mentioned in the comparison. This is not an equality-based
        reason for saying NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, but then explains it cannot answer the question due to lack
        of information. This is a case where the model is indicating it cannot make
        the comparison due to insufficient information, which falls under the UNKNOWN
        category.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I have already given a YES answer
        to this question" but then contradicts itself by saying it "cannot answer
        this question from the provided context." This is inconsistent and unclear,
        with no definitive YES or NO comparative answer. The model essentially indicates
        it lacks information to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, the
        question about equal values does not apply. According to the instructions,
        if the final answer was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide an answer
        to this question without additional context or information." This is a clear
        refusal to provide a comparative answer, indicating the model is declining
        to make the requested comparison.

        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that the passage provides no information
        about the locations being compared, indicating it cannot make the determination.
        This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to lack of information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the locations
        are at the same latitude or have equal positions. It simply states that Harding
        University is not south of Alcorn State University. The model does not mention
        equality as the reason for its NO answer. There is no indication that the
        values being compared (the latitudes or positions) are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "The location of Harding University,
        AR is not south of Alcorn State University, MS." This is a clear negative
        statement about the comparison, indicating that Harding University is NOT
        south of Alcorn State University. The model has provided a definitive NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "It is not possible to answer this
        question because the question does not provide any information about the location
        of either university." This indicates the model is refusing to make the comparison
        due to lack of information.

        is about McMurry University in Texas, not Lynn University in Florida. The
        model doesn't make any actual comparison or provide a definitive answer, so
        this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out a difference - that McMurry
        University is in Texas while Lynn University is in Florida. This difference
        in location is presented as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, making a definitive comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the question is about the
        location of McMurry University, TX, not Lynn University, FL. This suggests
        the model is rejecting the comparison for reasons other than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, making a clear negative comparative judgment.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. On the contrary, the model explicitly states that the
        universities are in different states (Texas vs. Florida), highlighting a difference
        rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that McMurry University is in Texas while Lynn University is in Florida.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" at the beginning
        of its response, even though it then contradicted itself by saying the question
        cannot be answered. Since the instructions say to use YES if the model explicitly
        states YES, I must classify this as YES.

        of its response, but then immediately clarifies that "the question cannot
        be answered because the location information is not provided in the context."
        This indicates the model is saying it cannot determine the answer due to lack

        or the same. It simply states that one is not south of the other, without
        explaining that this is because they are at the same latitude. The model does
        not mention equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, the location of Frederick
        S. Pardee RAND Graduate School, CA is not south of University of Louisiana
        at Lafayette, LA." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model starts with "No." which appears to be a
        direct answer. However, it then immediately presents two contradictory interpretations
        of the question, saying the answer could be either NO or YES depending on
        which institution is being asked about. The model concludes by stating "the
        context is not clear." This indicates the model is not providing a definitive
        comparative answer but rather expressing uncertainty about what is being asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the two institutions
        are in different states (New York vs. North Carolina), which is a clear difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Webb Institute is in New York while UNC Pembroke is in North
        Carolina.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        I must classify this as False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, let alone one based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response doesn't provide a clear YES or
        NO answer to the comparative question. Instead, it points out that the question
        is about the location of Webb Institute, NY, not the location of University
        of North Carolina at Pembroke, NC. The model doesn't make a comparison or
        provide a definitive answer, so this falls under UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the question is about the
        location of Webb Institute, NY, not about the location of University of North
        Carolina at Pembroke, NC. This suggests the model is rejecting the premise
        or framing of the question rather than stating the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "the location of Webb Institute,
        NY is not provided in the context, so the question cannot be answered." This
        indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.
        The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer, but rather indicates
        it cannot determine an answer.

        instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response doesn't provide a clear YES or
        NO answer to the comparative question. Instead, it points out that the question
        is about one location (Westfield State University) and not about another location
        (Lindenwood University-Belleville). This appears to be rejecting the premise
        of the question or indicating it cannot make the requested comparison. The
        model doesn't provide any definitive comparative judgment.

        \ of Florida A&M University \u2013 Florida State University College of Engineering,\
        \ FL.\" This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The response only repeats the same statement about
        the question topic multiple times without providing any actual answer. The
        model does not give a YES, NO, or any other comparative conclusion. It simply
        states what the question is about without addressing it.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this automatically results in False for this question according to
        the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response doesn't provide a clear YES or
        NO answer to the comparison. Instead, it points out that the question is about
        one university's location, not the other's. The model doesn't make any comparative
        judgment or provide a definitive answer to whatever the original question
        was asking.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the question is about a different
        university than what was mentioned in the comparison. This is not an equality-based
        reason for saying NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, making a clear negative comparative judgment.
      final_answer: 'NO'
