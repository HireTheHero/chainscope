      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Ohio is located north of South Carolina,
        which means Capital University is not south of Claflin University. The model
        is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether Capital University is south of Claflin
        University.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Ohio (where Capital University is) and South Carolina (where Claflin
        University is) are in different regions of the United States, with Ohio in
        the Midwest and South Carolina in the Southeast. The model is not claiming
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the universities are in different
        regions (Ohio in the Midwest and South Carolina in the Southeast) and uses
        this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The model is implying that
        Capital University is not south of Claflin University because of their relative
        geographic positions, not because they are at the same location.

        The model did not claim the values being compared are equal; rather, it stated
        it couldn't determine the answer without a map.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (We can't determine
        this without a map)." This indicates the model is saying NO because it cannot
        verify or determine the answer without additional information (a map). This
        falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is explicitly stating it
        "can't determine this" rather than making a comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal or the same. It simply outlines steps to compare
        the locations (find locations, use mapping service, compare) and then concludes
        with NO without providing the specific reason why. Since equality is not mentioned
        as the reason for the NO answer, this does not meet the criteria for True.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies in
        parentheses "(We can't determine this without a map)". This indicates the
        model is not making a comparative judgment about the locations, but rather
        stating it cannot verify the comparison due to lack of information. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN category as the model is indicating it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on geographical differences - that California State University San Marcos
        is in the southwestern United States while Winston-Salem State University
        is in the southeastern United States. This indicates a difference in location
        (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that the universities are in different
        locations (Winston-Salem, North Carolina vs. San Marcos, California) and explicitly
        states they are "in different regions of the United States." The NO answer
        appears to be based on this difference in location, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states "NO" without providing
        any specific reason for this answer. It doesn't mention equality as the reason
        for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographic relationship
        between California and Texas, stating they are "in different states." The
        model does not claim the locations have equal latitude or are at the same
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that Oklahoma City University
        is in Oklahoma and Tarleton State University is in Texas, and concludes NO
        without explicitly stating they are at the same latitude or have equal positions.
        The model doesn't provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Based on the above reasoning,

        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply concludes "NO" without explaining
        that the universities are at the same latitude or providing any reason for
        its answer. The model does not claim the locations are identical or equal
        as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in

        answer. It outlines steps to determine the answer but doesn't actually execute
        those steps or explain why the answer is NO. It doesn't state that the values
        (locations) are equal or the same, nor does it provide any other reason for
        the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes a difference in locations - Oklahoma
        City University is in Oklahoma (Midwestern region) while Tarleton State University
        is in Texas (southern part). This difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion after comparing the locations of the two universities.

        as UNKNOWN), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response consists entirely of repeated
        attempts to break down the question, but it never actually provides an answer
        to the question. The model does not give a YES or NO answer, nor does it explicitly
        refuse to answer. It simply repeats the same analysis framework without reaching
        a conclusion.

        say whether Oklahoma City University is south of Tarleton State University
        without a map." This is not a definitive NO to the comparative question, but
        rather indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer, stating
        "Pennsylvania is north of North Carolina" and "Indiana University of Pennsylvania
        is not located south of University of North Carolina Wilmington." The model
        is indicating a difference in location (north vs. south), not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        Texas is south of Ohio, meaning Cincinnati Christian University (in Ohio)
        is not south of Texas Tech University College of Architecture (in Texas).
        The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of the
        two universities.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        of a geographical difference - Texas is to the south of Ohio, and the two
        universities are in these different states. The model is noting a difference
        in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its conclusion, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (We can't determine this without
        a map)". This is not a definitive NO to the comparative question, but rather
        indicates the model cannot make the determination due to lack of information.
        The parenthetical clarification makes it clear that the model is saying it
        cannot verify the comparison.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that the universities are in different
        states (Ohio vs. Texas) and different regions (Midwest vs. South), which implies
        a difference in their locations. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its conclusion after comparing the locations of the two universities.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating "Since Ohio is to the east of Texas, Cincinnati Christian University
        is not located south of Texas Tech University College of Architecture." The
        model is indicating a directional difference (east vs. south) as the reason
        for its NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that both are in the northeastern
        United States, but it doesn't claim they have identical locations. The model's
        reasoning is that Widener University is not south of Mildred Elley, not that
        they are in the exact same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether Widener University is located south
        of Mildred Elley.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        relationship between New York and Delaware, noting that "New York is north
        of Delaware" and the institutions are in these respective states. The model
        is indicating a difference in location, not equality.

        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it implies that Mildred Elley
        is in New York and Widener University is in Pennsylvania, and based on this
        geographical difference, it concludes "NO". The model does not claim the locations
        are identical or equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" as indicated in the

        are equal or the same. It simply states "NO" without providing any explanation
        about whether the locations are at the same latitude or why one is not south
        of the other. Since equality is not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer,
        this is False.

        The model did not claim the values being compared are equal; rather, it stated
        it couldn't determine the answer without a map.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (We can't determine
        this without a map)." This indicates the model is saying NO because it cannot
        verify or determine the answer without additional information (a map). This
        falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is explicitly stating it
        "can't determine this" rather than making a comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it simply states that Anderson
        University is in Indiana while Oklahoma State University-Oklahoma City is
        in Oklahoma, and concludes "NO" based on this information. It doesn't explicitly
        say they're at the same latitude or otherwise equal in position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that Anderson University is in Indiana
        (Midwest region) while Oklahoma State University-Oklahoma City is in Oklahoma
        (South region), implying a difference in location as the reason for the NO
        answer.
