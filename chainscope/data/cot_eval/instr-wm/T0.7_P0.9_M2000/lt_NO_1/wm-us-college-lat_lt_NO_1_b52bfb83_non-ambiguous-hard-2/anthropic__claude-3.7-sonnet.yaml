      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Capital University
        is north of Claflin University, indicating a difference in their geographic
        positions. The reason for the NO answer is that Capital University is north,
        not south, of Claflin University.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Capital University in
        Ohio is not located south of Claflin University in South Carolina." This is
        an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False. The model did not give a NO
        answer based on equal values, but rather indicated it couldn't make the comparison
        because one of the institutions doesn't exist as described.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that Selma University is south of Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg
        because the second institution doesn't exist as described in the question."
        This is a case where the model is rejecting the premise of the question because
        one of the institutions doesn't exist as described. The model is not making
        a comparative judgment about locations, but rather stating it cannot make
        the comparison due to the non-existence of one entity.
