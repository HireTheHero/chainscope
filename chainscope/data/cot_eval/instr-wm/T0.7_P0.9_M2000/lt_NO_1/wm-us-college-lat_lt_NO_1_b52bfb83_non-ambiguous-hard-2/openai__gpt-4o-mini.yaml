        and "Columbus, Ohio (where Capital University is located) is situated north
        of Orangeburg, South Carolina (where Claflin University is located)." The
        model is indicating a directional difference (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is **NO**"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in latitudes, stating
        "Claflin University (Orangeburg, SC) has a lower latitude than Capital University
        (Columbus, OH), this means Claflin University is further south than Capital
        University." The NO answer is based on this difference in latitudes, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Capital University in Ohio is located south of
        Claflin University in South Carolina. The model clearly provides this comparative
        result after analyzing the latitudes of both locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Capital University is in Ohio which is
        north of South Carolina (where Claflin University is located). The model is
        saying NO because the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - Capital
        is north of Claflin, not south of it.

        is **NO**" at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer

        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that

        of Claflin University. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Capital University in Ohio is located south of Claflin University
        in South Carolina. The model concludes that since Ohio is north of South Carolina,
        Capital University would be north of Claflin University, not south.

        The model is giving NO because one location is north of the other, not because
        they are at the same location.
