      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values being compared\
        \ are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Capital University is north\
        \ of Claflin University because Ohio is north of South Carolina. The model\

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Capital University, OH is NOT located south of Claflin
        University, SC. This is a clear negative comparative answer to the question.

    226a00cd-889b-49bb-8c28-8ffa60f33f75:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the universities
        are at different latitudes and that "Claflin University is south of Capital
        University, not the other way around." The model gives a NO answer because
        the relationship is the opposite of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Capital University is not south of Claflin University.
        The model clearly provides a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Capital University
        is NORTH of Claflin University, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Capital University in Ohio is not located south
        of Claflin University in South Carolina. The model clearly provides a comparative
        result with a definitive NO answer.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the universities are at different
        latitudes, with Claflin University being south of Capital University. The
        model gives the reason for its NO answer as the fact that South Carolina has
        a lower latitude than Ohio, meaning Claflin University is south of Capital
        University, not the other way around.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Capital University is

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the universities
        are in different positions, with Capital University being north of Claflin
        University. The reason for the NO answer is that Capital University is in
        Ohio (a northern state) while Claflin University is in South Carolina (a southern
        state), making them geographically different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Capital University, OH located south of Claflin University,

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that the Liechtenstein Institute (in NJ) is not south of Kennesaw

        The NO answer is based on a directional difference (north vs. south), not
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - The Liechtenstein
        Institute on Self-Determination in NJ is not located south of Kennesaw State

        a directional difference. The reason for the NO answer is that one location
        is north of the other, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        answer is based on the opposite directional relationship (north vs. south)
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Elizabeth City State University is not south of Florida A&M
        University-Florida State University College of Engineering. The model makes
        a direct comparative judgment with a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ff40ecb1-bea2-43f5-8090-e84bb873885c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Elizabeth City State University being NORTH of Florida A&M-FSU
        College of Engineering. The reason for the NO answer is that the premise is
        incorrect (Elizabeth City State is north, not south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Elizabeth City State University is NOT located south
        of Florida A&M University-Florida State University College of Engineering.
        This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
