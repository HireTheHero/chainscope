      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Ohio is north of South Carolina,
        and therefore Capital University would be north of Claflin University. The
        NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality of values.

        for the NO answer, stating that "Ohio is north of South Carolina" and therefore
        "any institution in Ohio would be north of any institution in South Carolina."
        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Ohio Dominican University

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating "Ohio is north of Texas" and therefore Ohio Dominican
        University is not south of Whitacre College of Engineering. The model is indicating
        a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        for its NO answer - specifically that "Ohio is generally north of Texas" and
        therefore "Ohio Dominican University is not south of Whitacre College of Engineering."
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference (north vs. south), not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

        are equal. Instead, it explains that Ohio Dominican University is in Ohio
        which is north of Texas where Whitacre College of Engineering is located.
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference (Ohio being north of Texas),
        not on the locations being the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Texas is south of Ohio" and therefore "any
        institution in Texas would be south of any institution in Ohio." The model
        is giving a directional reason for its NO answer, not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that Ohio Dominican University
        is not located south of Whitacre College of Engineering because Texas (where
        Whitacre College is located) is south of Ohio (where Ohio Dominican University
        is located).

        for its NO answer, stating that "Ohio Dominican University, being in Ohio,
        is north of Whitacre College of Engineering, which is in Texas" and therefore
        "it is not south of Whitacre College of Engineering." The NO is based on a
        directional difference, not equality.

        NO answer, stating that "Ohio Dominican University is in Ohio and Whitacre
        College of Engineering is in Texas, Ohio Dominican University is located north
        of Whitacre College of Engineering." The NO is based on a directional difference
        (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question asks if
        Ohio Dominican University is located south of Whitacre College of Engineering.
        Given our analysis, the answer is **NO**." This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.

        that Ohio Dominican University is north of Whitacre College of Engineering
        (not south), as Ohio is north of Texas. The model identified a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Ohio Dominican University is located south of Whitacre College

        stating that "Ohio is northeast and Texas is south" and "any institution in
        Ohio would be north of any institution in Texas." The model is saying NO because
        it believes one location is north of the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to whether
        Ohio Dominican University, OH is located south of Whitacre College of Engineering,

        - specifically that "the University of Hartford (CT) is north of Arkansas
        State University-Newport (AR)" because "Connecticut is northeast and Arkansas

        of University of Hartford (not equal). The model concludes NO because the
        premise in the question has the directionality reversed - it's saying that
        Hartford is NOT south of Arkansas State, rather than saying they're at the
        same latitude.

        on directional difference (north vs. south), not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that the University of Hartford, CT is not located south

        in the boxed conclusion. The model is answering the question about whether
        Husson University in Maine is north of Franciscan University of Steubenville
        in Ohio, and it concludes that Husson University is indeed north of Franciscan
