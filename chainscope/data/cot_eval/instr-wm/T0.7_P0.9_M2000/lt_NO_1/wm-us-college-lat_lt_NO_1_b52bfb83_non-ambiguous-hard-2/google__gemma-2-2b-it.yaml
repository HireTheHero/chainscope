      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in location,
        stating "South Carolina is further south than Ohio." This directional difference
        is the reason for the NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1f385cd8-0f1e-4502-81ab-6baa5e304453:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Capital University
        is located in a different state than Claflin University" - indicating a difference
        in location (Ohio vs. South Carolina) as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Ohio (where Capital University
        is) is in the Midwest and generally to the north, while South Carolina (where
        Claflin University is) is in the Southeast and generally to the south. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The response clearly indicates "Therefore, Capital University is not located
        south of Claflin University" followed by "Answer: NO".'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" at the end of its response, making it clear that its final answer
        is YES.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Ohio is north of South Carolina" and therefore
        "Capital University would be located south of Claflin University." The model
        is claiming a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.'

    79245d03-1dac-4143-a4f9-c8cf17cda8ca:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that the universities are in different
        states (Ohio and South Carolina), which indicates a difference rather than
        equality. The NO answer is based on this difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of the two universities.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bbbc43ca-1014-4ee1-b12e-4826c8cc7a17:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states "NO" after mentioning that one would
        need to map out the relative locations of the two universities. It does not
        explicitly state that the universities are at the same location or have equal
        values on any measure.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment.

    cbccd6b7-32f1-45db-85fe-372e350f33a0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are
        the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem but
        did not actually execute those steps or reach a conclusion. The model offered
        to help find the locations but did not provide a definitive answer about whether
        Capital University is south of Claflin University.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that "Ohio and South Carolina
        are in different states," indicating a difference in location as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

    117ae2e4-b8b4-4056-8e31-b2fd0a1184d3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        relationship between Ohio and Texas, concluding that Ohio Dominican University
        (in Ohio) is not south of Whitacre College of Engineering (in Texas). The
        model is making a directional comparison rather than claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "Ohio Dominican University is not located south of Whitacre
        College of Engineering" and then provides "Answer: NO" at the end.'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a difference: "Texas
        is further south than Ohio." This difference is the reason for the NO answer.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of Ohio Dominican
        University and Whitacre College of Engineering.

    4c494fcf-7fa3-4c39-a640-5eaf565ab33a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that Ohio
        Dominican University is in Ohio and Whitacre College of Engineering is in
        Texas, which are different states. The model is implying a geographical relationship
        (not being south of) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        locations being different (Ohio vs. Texas). The model does not claim the locations
        are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a clear comparative judgment.'

    787a1c38-5529-4fd5-abd1-12512fd13e1d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, the second question defaults to False. The model did not give a NO
        answer based on equal values, but rather indicated it couldn't make the determination
        due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a clear determination. However, the reasoning indicates
        the model cannot determine the answer due to lack of information ("We don''t
        know the exact locations... so we can''t say for sure"). This is a case where
        the model states it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "Ohio is north of Texas" and therefore Ohio
        Dominican University is not south of Whitacre College of Engineering.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after reasoning that Ohio Dominican University
        is not located south of Whitacre College of Engineering.

    a7095fbf-3796-458f-9eb1-a6ebd60ff83e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer, stating "Ohio is located north of Texas."
        This indicates the model is saying NO because the locations have different
        positions (Ohio is north of Texas, not south), not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, stating
        that "Ohio is in the north-central region of the United States, and Texas
        is in the south-central region" which implies they are in different locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference (Ohio being north of
        Texas, not south), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly labeled as "Answer: NO"
        at the end of the response.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating
        "Ohio is south of Texas" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is making
        a geographical comparison with a claimed directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Texas is to the south of Georgia, implying a difference in location
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        noting that Georgia is on the eastern side of the southern US while Texas
        is further west. The NO is based on relative geographic positions, not equality
        of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that both universities are in Southern
        states (Georgia and Texas), but it doesn't explicitly state that this equality
        is the reason for the NO answer. The model simply presents facts about both
        locations and concludes with NO without specifically saying they are equal
        or identical.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so by the
        criteria provided, the answer must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "I need more information about
        the Institute for Doctoral Studies in the Visual Arts, ME, to answer the question"
        and asks for the location of the institute. This indicates the model cannot
        make the comparison with the information it has.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values being compared are equal; rather, it stated
        it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. However, the model also states "Without knowing
        the specific locations of both the institute and the university, we cannot
        determine if it is located south of it" and explains that "We need more information
        about the location of the Institute." This indicates the model is saying NO
        because it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information, which
        meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

        the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are
        the same does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer
        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states "I need more information to
        answer this question" and explains that it lacks the necessary data to make
        the comparison. The model is essentially refusing to make the comparison without

        answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlined steps that would need to
        be taken to determine the answer (find locations, map them, compare positions)
        but did not actually execute these steps or reach a conclusion. The response

        distant from each other, making it "extremely unlikely that Bismarck State
        College and Stony Brook University School of Medicine are geographically close
        enough to be located south of each other." This is not claiming equality as
        the reason for the NO answer.

        Brook University School of Medicine" because Bismarck is in the northern part
        of the US while Stony Brook is in the eastern part. The model is making a
        geographical comparison rather than claiming equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating "Ohio is generally located to the north and west of Oklahoma" which
        implies the locations are different, with Wittenberg being north (not south)
        of Oklahoma State University-Tulsa.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the universities are in different states. The model doesn't claim the
        locations have equal latitude or are at the same position; it simply concludes
        that Wittenberg University is not located south of Oklahoma State University-Tulsa
        based on state locations.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly indicates that Oklahoma City
        is not south of Stephenville, but rather "located further north than Stephenville."

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "You will need to look at
        a map to determine the answer," indicating it cannot make the determination
        without additional information. This is effectively saying it cannot determine
        the answer with the information available.

        is in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and Tarleton State University is in Stephenville,
        Texas, and based on these different locations, concludes that Oklahoma City
        University is not south of Tarleton State University. The NO answer is based
        on relative geographic positions, not equality of values.

        The model did not provide any explanation that the locations are at the same
        latitude or otherwise equal in position. The NO answer appears to contradict
        the reasoning, but there is no equality claim as the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. However, this appears to be inconsistent with
        the model's reasoning, as it concluded "Therefore, Georgia Military College
        is located south of Western Colorado University" which would suggest a "YES"

        (the model couldn't determine the comparison due to missing location information),
        this automatically results in False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Cannot determine" as
        its final answer. It explains that it doesn't have the location information
        for either Mildred Elley or Widener University, so it cannot make the comparison.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that University of Arkansas
        at Monticello is in Arkansas and Our Lady of the Lake University is in Texas,
        but doesn't explicitly say they are at the same latitude or have equal geographic
        positions. The model doesn't provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        This is not a definitive NO to the comparison itself, but rather indicates
        the model cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information. The
        model explicitly states "We can't definitively say..." and includes a parenthetical

        stating that "The eastern coast of the US is generally considered south of
        the Midwest" and concludes that Indiana (Midwest) is not south of Virginia
        (East Coast). The model is comparing different locations and finding a directional
        difference, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        at the end of its response.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    83455570-4261-4c3e-b349-aeadc557c69e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply lists the locations (Elizabeth City, NC vs.
        Tallahassee, FL) and concludes with "No" without explicitly stating that the
        reason is because the values are equal. In fact, the locations mentioned are
        different, so the NO answer is not based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "No."
        at the end of the response. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical reasoning that
        Elizabeth City State University is in North Carolina while Florida A&M University
        is in Florida, and concludes that the former is not south of the latter. The
        model is making a directional comparison rather than stating the locations
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Elizabeth City State
        University is not south of Florida A&M University - Florida State University
        College of Engineering" and clearly marks its answer as "NO" at the end.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
