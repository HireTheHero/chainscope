      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Capital University being north of Claflin University (not
        south). The model's reasoning is based on the directional difference between
        the two locations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Capital University is not south of Claflin University. This
        is a direct answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Capital University
        is north of Claflin University, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference (north
        vs. south), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question of whether Capital University is south of Claflin University.

      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values being compared\
        \ are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that the locations have different\
        \ latitudes (Capital University at roughly 40\xB0 N and Claflin University\
        \ at roughly 33\xB0 N). The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Capital\
        \ University is north of Claflin University, not south, which indicates a\
        \ difference in values rather than equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that Capital University is located north of Claflin University,
        not south, and therefore answers "NO" to the question of whether Capital University
        is located south of Claflin University.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Capital University is in
        Ohio which is north of South Carolina where Claflin University is located.
        The model explicitly states "Capital University is north of Claflin University"
        as the reason for its NO answer, indicating a directional difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" and then repeats "NO" at the end of its response. This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the opposite relationship is true - Capital University is north of Claflin
        University, not south as asked in the question. The model explicitly states
        "Capital University (in Ohio) is located north of Claflin University (in South
        Carolina)" and "Based on the comparison, it is north." This indicates a difference
        in values (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response, providing a direct answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Furman University
        is north of Georgia Southern University-Armstrong Campus, indicating a clear
        directional difference between their locations. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It clearly concludes that Furman University is not south of Georgia Southern
        University-Armstrong Campus, but rather north of it. The model provides a

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        Winston-Salem State University is located NORTH of California State University
        San Marcos (36 degrees North vs. 33 degrees North). The model's NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Winston-Salem State University, NC located south of California
        State University San Marcos, CA?" The model explicitly concludes with "NO"
        after determining that Winston-Salem State University is actually north of
        California State University San Marcos based on latitude comparison.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that North Carolina is "generally
        northeast of southern California" and therefore Winston-Salem is not south
        of San Marcos. The model is indicating a directional difference (northeast
        vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        North latitude. The model concludes that Winston-Salem is north of San Marcos
        (not south), which is why it answers NO. The values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that Winston-Salem State University is not located

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response clearly indicates a reasoning
        process that concludes Winston-Salem is north of San Marcos, not south. The

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Eastern University
        in Pennsylvania is north of Texas Tech University in Texas because Pennsylvania
        is significantly further north than Texas. The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (north vs. south), not on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Eastern University, PA located south of Texas Tech University

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines
        that Eastern University is north of Texas Tech University, not south as the
        question asked. The model explicitly states "Since Pennsylvania is north of
        Texas, Eastern University, PA is north of Texas Tech University College of
        Human Sciences, TX" and "The question asks if Eastern University is south
        of Texas Tech. Since it's north, the answer is no." This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Northeast Wisconsin
        Technical College is not south of Andrews University because Green Bay is
        north of Berrien Springs.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the locations have different relative positions - specifically that St.
        Andrews University is north of Columbus Technical College (not south as the
        question asked). The model explicitly states "Laurinburg is north of Columbus"
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that St. Andrews University
        (in Laurinburg, NC) is north of Columbus Technical College (in Columbus, GA),
        and therefore concluded that the statement that St. Andrews is south of Columbus
        Technical College is false.

        values (34.7 N for Laurinburg, NC vs 32.5 N for Columbus, GA) and concludes
        that St. Andrews University is north of Columbus Technical College, not south.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is St. Andrews University, NC located south of Columbus Technical

        College in Columbus, GA (not south as the question asked). The model explicitly
        states "Laurinburg, NC is north of Columbus, GA" as the reason for its NO
        answer, indicating a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether St. Andrews University is located south of Columbus
        Technical College. The model explicitly concludes "No, Laurinburg, NC is north

        are different (St. Andrews University at ~34.7 degrees North and Columbus
        Technical College at ~32.5 degrees North). The NO answer is given because
        St. Andrews University is north of Columbus Technical College, not south as
        the question asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The final answer is $\boxed{NO}$"
        at the end of its response. It provides a step-by-step reasoning process comparing

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with LISD being north of KSU. The reason for the NO answer is that
        LISD is north of KSU, not south as the question asked, indicating a directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        explicitly states that Princeton, NJ is further north than Kennesaw, GA, indicating
        a difference in latitude. The model's reasoning suggests the answer should
        have been YES, but it concluded with NO without claiming equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which contradicts its reasoning that "the Liechtenstein Institute
        on Self-Determination is located north of Kennesaw State University College
        of Arts." This appears to be an error in the model's final answer, but I must
        evaluate based on what was explicitly stated, not what is logically consistent

        that the locations have different latitudes, with Monticello being north of
        San Antonio (not south). The model explicitly states "Monticello, AR is located
        north of San Antonio, TX" and concludes that since the question asks if Monticello
        is south of San Antonio, the answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Monticello is located south of San Antonio. The
        model determined that Monticello is north of San Antonio, and therefore answered
        "NO" to the question asking if it's south.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that the latitudes are different (43.8
        degrees North for Viterbo vs 37.8 degrees North for Mountain State) and concludes
        that Viterbo is north of Mountain State, not south. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Viterbo is located south of Mountain State. The
        model explains that Viterbo is located north of Mountain State based on latitude
        comparisons, and concludes with an explicit "NO" answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Viterbo University
        is north of Mountain State University's former location. The NO answer is
        based on a directional difference (north vs. south), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. The model clearly concludes that "Viterbo
        University is north of Mountain State University's former location. Therefore,
        it is not south of it."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that the latitudes are different (La
        Crosse, WI at 43.8 degrees North and Beckley, WV at 37.8 degrees North). The
        model says NO because Viterbo is north of Mountain State University, not because
        they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Viterbo University
        is not south of Mountain State University (it's actually north, as the model
        explains).

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "La Crosse, WI is
        north of Beckley, WV" and "La Crosse, WI is significantly further north than
        Beckley, WV." The NO answer is based on the directional difference (north
        vs. south), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" and reiterates "**Answer:** NO" at the end of its response. The model
        is directly answering the comparative question with a definitive NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines
        that Viterbo University is at a higher latitude (43.8 degrees North) than
        Mountain State University (37.8 degrees North), making it north of Mountain
        State University, not south. The model explicitly notes this difference in
        values and uses it as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Viterbo University is located south of Mountain
        State University. The model clearly concludes that Viterbo University is north
        of Mountain State University, not south, and therefore answers "NO" to the
        comparative question.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have different
        latitudes, with Viterbo University being north of Mountain State University.
        The reason for the NO answer is that Viterbo is north (not south) of Mountain
        State University, not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion and reiterates it with a capitalized "NO" at the very end
        of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Anderson, IN is
        further north than Oklahoma City, OK (step 6), indicating a difference in
        latitude. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that Anderson is north
        of Oklahoma City, not south, which means the locations have different latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 9, where it says "Provide the final YES/NO answer" followed by "NO".
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Anderson University
        is north of Oklahoma State University-Oklahoma City, indicating a difference
        in latitude. The NO answer is given because Anderson University is north (not
        south) of OSU-OKC.

        FL" and "Since ECSU is north of the College of Engineering, the answer is
        no." The model is rejecting the premise that ECSU is south of FAMU-FSU by
        stating they have different latitudes (one is north of the other).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Elizabeth City is
        north of Tallahassee, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference (north vs.
        south), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The final answer is NO"
        in a boxed format at the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the opposite directional relationship is true - it concluded that Elizabeth
        City State University is north of Florida A&M/FSU college, not south. The
        model explicitly states "Since ECSU is north, the answer is no." This indicates
        a difference in location (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Elizabeth City State
        University is north of Florida A&M/FSU college, and therefore not south of
        it, leading to the "NO" answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after
        determining that ECSU is north of the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering, not
        south as the question asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that ECSU is north of the College
        of Engineering, which is the opposite of what was asked (if ECSU is south
        of the College of Engineering). The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not on equality of values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Elizabeth City State
        University is north of FAMU-FSU College of Engineering, indicating a clear
        directional difference in their locations. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference (north vs. south), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Elizabeth City State University is located south
        of the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering. The model explains that Elizabeth
        City is north of Tallahassee, so ECSU is north of FAMU-FSU College of Engineering,
        leading to a definitive "NO" answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it found that ECSU
        is north of the College of Engineering, not south of it. The model did not
        state or imply that the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that ECSU is north of the
        College of Engineering, not south of it, and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        at the end of its response.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that ECSU is north of
        FAMU-FSU College of Engineering, indicating a directional difference. The
        reason for the NO answer is that the statement claimed ECSU is south of FAMU-FSU,
        which the model determined is false because ECSU is actually north of FAMU-FSU.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Final Answer is NO" at
