      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined that Capital
        University is north of Claflin University (not south). The model explicitly
        states "Capital University in Ohio is located north of Claflin University
        in South Carolina" as its reasoning. This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
