        University. The model determined that UW-Marathon County is north of Franklin
        Pierce University, and therefore answered "NO" to the question asking if it
        is south.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that North Carolina is located north of Florida,
        and therefore Elizabeth City State University must be north of any location
        in Florida. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Elizabeth City State
        University is not south of Florida A&M University - Florida State University
        College of Engineering)" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Elizabeth City State
