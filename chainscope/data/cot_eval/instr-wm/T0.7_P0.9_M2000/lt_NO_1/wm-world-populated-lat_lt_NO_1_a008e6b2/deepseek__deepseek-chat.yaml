      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or have equal north-south positions. Instead, it indicates
        there is a directional difference (Caulfield East is southwest of Monbulk),
        which means they are not at the same position. The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" after
        explaining that Caulfield East is southwest of Monbulk, not directly south.
        This is an explicit NO comparative answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or equally south. Instead, it explicitly states that Monbulk
        is "slightly south of Caulfield East" and gives this directional difference
        as the reason for the NO answer.

        is a difference, stating that "Monbulk is further east and slightly south

        to the west and slightly north of Monbulk."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that Monbulk is "further east
        and slightly further south than Caulfield East," indicating a difference in
        position. The NO answer is based on Caulfield East being north of Monbulk,
        not because of equal positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - it explicitly states that Caulfield East is southwest
        of Monbulk, indicating a directional difference. The NO is based on the fact
        that the location is southwest rather than directly south.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" and provides

        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not relevant to
        evaluate since we only assess this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its conclusion,

        because one entity is contained within the other, making a directional comparison
        impossible. This is a different type of reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as the answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal/identical. Instead, the reason given is that one location
        is part of the other, making the comparison invalid. The model does not state
        that the locations have equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" and
        provides a clear comparative conclusion, explaining that Thiruvananthapuram
        is not located south of the metropolitan area because it is part of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same in any way. Instead, it explains that they are different because
        they are in different hemispheres (Eastern vs Western) and separated by the
        Atlantic Ocean. The NO answer is based on their different positions, not on
        equality.

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Mbulu District
        is east of Fernando de Noronha (indicating a difference in position), and
        the NO answer is based on Mbulu District not being south of the comparison
        point.
