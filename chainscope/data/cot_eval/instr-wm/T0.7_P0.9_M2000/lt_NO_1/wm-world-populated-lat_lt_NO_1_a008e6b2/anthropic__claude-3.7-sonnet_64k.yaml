        extending outward in all directions. The model's reasoning is about spatial
        relationship (center vs. south) rather than equality of values.

        relationship rather than being equal. The model's reasoning is that the city
        is contained within the metropolitan area, not that they are at the same location
        or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Thiruvananthapuram is

        the city is the core of the metropolitan area which extends outward in all
        directions, making the directional comparison invalid, not that the locations
        are identical.

        is the core or central part of the Thiruvananthapuram metropolitan area, and
        that the metropolitan area extends outward from the city in all directions.
        The NO answer is based on the logical relationship between a city and its
        metropolitan area (the city being contained within the metropolitan area),
        not because the locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

        core city that forms the central part of the metropolitan area, with the metropolitan
        boundaries extending outward in all directions. The model's reasoning is that
        the city cannot be south of an area that contains it centrally, not that they
        are equal or identical entities.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

        outward from the city in all directions. The model's reasoning is that the
        city cannot be south of its metropolitan area because it is contained within
        it, not because they are the same geographic entity.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.

        \ (24.14\xB0 N) has a slightly higher latitude than Murshidabad district (24.1\xB0\
        \ N), which means it's positioned slightly more to the north. The model's\
        \ NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on them being equal."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response.
        The model directly answers the question "Is Central District, Taichung located
        south of Murshidabad district?" with "NO" as its final conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_final_answer: "The model clearly states \"YES\" as its final answer\

        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether it gave a NO answer because the
        values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer.
        The answer appears at the end of the response where it says "# Answer: YES"
