        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in position, stating that
        Caulfield East is "west and slightly south of Monbulk" and is "slightly NORTH
        of Monbulk's latitude". The NO answer appears to be based on these positional
        differences, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (southwest vs south).
        The NO is because Caulfield East is southwest rather than directly south of
        Monbulk.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model emphasizes how close the latitudes
        are ("almost exactly the same", "essentially at the same latitude"), it ultimately
        states there is a tiny difference with "Buck Meadows being very slightly north
        if anything". Any difference, no matter how slight, means this is not a case
        of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.

        slightly north of Silverton (by a tiny fraction of a degree)". Since it identifies
        a directional difference, even though tiny, this is not a case of equal values
        being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions - in fact, it explicitly states that Urswick is further north
        than Lofthouse. The NO answer is based on this difference in position, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Urswick is in Cumbria which is north of Yorkshire where Lofthouse is located).
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparison, providing a direct comparative result based
        on geographical reasoning.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it concluded NO because it determined Urswick
        is north of Lofthouse (being in Cumbria which is north of Yorkshire). The
        response indicates a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that Urswick is not south of Lofthouse.
        This was a direct NO answer based on geographical reasoning.

        (Urswick being north of Lofthouse), not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a difference in position, with
        Urswick being "further north than Lofthouse."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the relative positions
        of the locations (stating Urswick is north of Lofthouse, not south).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that Prathipadu is NORTH of Uppalapadu, not because the locations are at the
        same position. It explicitly states there is a difference in position (one
        is in northern part, one in southern part).

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there is a directional difference (Uppalapadu is south
        of Prathipadu). Any directional difference, even if slight, means we should
        classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Uppalapadu is south of Prathipadu, making it impossible
        for Prathipadu to be south of Uppalapadu.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values criteria only
        apply when evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Central
        District, Taichung is located south of Murshidabad district." This is a clear
        affirmative answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The model actually found a slight difference
        in latitude, with one location being slightly south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its step-by-step analysis, concluding that Central District is south
        of Murshidabad district.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis doesn't apply since
        we only analyze that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Central
        District, Taichung is located slightly south of Murshidabad district."
      final_answer: 'YES'

        at roughly the same latitude (around 24\xB0N)\", this equality is not given\
        \ as the reason for the NO answer. Instead, the NO is based on finding a different\
        \ directional relationship (east) than what was being asked about (south)."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on its directional analysis showing
        that Central District is east, not south, of Murshidabad.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    90e11bf4-ad56-46cb-bf51-0557bbc70955:

      explanation_equal_values: "The model states that the locations are \"at approximately\
        \ the same latitude\" and explicitly uses this equality as the reason for\
        \ the NO answer. The model does not note any latitudinal difference between\
        \ the locations, even a slight one, and the equality of their latitudes (both\
        \ at 24\xB0N) is given as the primary reason for the NO answer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies that
        Central District, Taichung is not located south of Murshidabad district because
        they are at approximately the same latitude.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values check only applies when
        the final answer is NO
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both locations are at roughly
        the same latitude" and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO
        answer, stating "Since they're at approximately the same latitude, neither
        is significantly south of the other." The model does note an east-west difference,
        but this wasn't the reason for the NO answer regarding the south comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that Central District, Taichung is not located south of Murshidabad district
        as its final comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        \ \"at approximately the same latitude (around 24\xB0N)\" and \"roughly at\
        \ the same latitude\" as the reason for its NO answer. This equality is given\
        \ as the primary reason for the negative response."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result rather than indicating inability
        to determine or rejecting premises.

        \ therefore the south comparison \"isn't really applicable.\" The NO answer\
        \ is directly based on their equal latitudes."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies that
        Central District is not located south of Murshidabad district. This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.
