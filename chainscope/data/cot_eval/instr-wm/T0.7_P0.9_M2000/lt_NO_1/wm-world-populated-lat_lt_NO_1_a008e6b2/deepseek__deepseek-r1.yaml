      explanation_equal_values: "Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN\

      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never actually
        provides a clear final answer. While it mentions "NO" several times in its
        reasoning process, it ends mid-sentence with "So the" and appears to be still
        considering alternatives. The last complete thought suggests uncertainty ("But

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did discuss similar latitudes at points but never gave a NO answer based on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. It considers multiple approaches and coordinates
        but remains uncertain, presenting contradictory possibilities throughout.
        The response ends without making a definitive comparative statement about
        whether Caulfield East is south of Monbulk.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never gave a final NO answer, so we don't need to evaluate whether equal values
        were involved.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought, questioning
        its own understanding of Conflict Group's location. While it temporarily reached
        a "YES" conclusion, it then immediately doubted this conclusion and didn't
        provide a final answer before cutting off. Given this uncertainty and lack
        of final conclusion, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        never reaches a definitive conclusion. While it explores various possibilities
        and at times suggests "NO" might be the answer (e.g., "Then the answer would
        be NO"), it continues to alternate between different scenarios and express
        uncertainty. Without a clear final answer, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        is about containment/overlap rather than equality of position. The model explicitly
        states "the city lies *within* the metropolitan area" as its reason for NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        The model never made a NO comparison, so the question of equal values is not
        applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response appears to be incomplete (cut
        off mid-sentence) and never reaches a definitive YES/NO conclusion. Throughout
        the response, the model repeatedly speculates about possible locations but
        explicitly states it cannot recall exact information and doesn't have access
        to geographical records. The response consists mainly of "maybes" and "alternatives"
        without reaching a final comparative answer.

        the southern part of Guntur district and Prathipadu is "not further south,"
        implying different positions. The NO is based on Prathipadu being located
        north of Uppalapadu, not being at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reaffirms this with an explanation that Prathipadu is not located south

        being "more centrally or northward." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that "Prathipadu in Guntur district is not located
        south of Uppalapadu." While the model expresses uncertainty in its reasoning
        process, it ultimately commits to a definitive NO answer with directional

        with "If Holme-next") and never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion. While it
        explores various possibilities and calculations, it doesn't make a definitive
        comparative statement about which location is further south.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends abruptly without giving
        an explicit final YES/NO answer. While it discusses coordinates and seems
        to be leaning towards NO several times (saying "Therefore, the answer would
        be NO" and "Therefore, the answer should be NO"), it continues to question
        its analysis and ends without a definitive conclusion.
