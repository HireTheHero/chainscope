    30066606-6f4f-4d54-aa59-bf653ceae176:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same coordinates or equal in position. Instead, it explains that Caulfield
        East is in Melbourne's south-eastern area while Monbulk is east and somewhat
        north of Melbourne's southern suburbs, indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with "NO" being the last line and also stating "Caulfield
        East is *not* south of Monbulk."
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    391e8105-b5cc-47bb-9adb-4cbb6bd747ba:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - in fact, it explicitly noted differences in their positions, stating
        that Monbulk is "significantly further east" and Caulfield East is "more southerly."
        The NO answer appears to be based on these differences rather than any equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6cf4aa1a-0911-4fc4-bd1e-52c241c44e4f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or equally north/south. Instead, it explains that Caulfield
        East is NOT south of Monbulk because of their relative positions (with Monbulk
        being in the Dandenong Ranges which are "north of Melbourne's southeastern
        suburbs" where Caulfield East is located). The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result (evaluating whether Caulfield
        East is south of Monbulk). The answer is definitive and not qualified with
        uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    70cd7a6a-acd5-4908-b99c-c7e855de6eab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Caulfield East is "north-west of Monbulk"). The NO answer appears to be based
        on this directional difference rather than any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the locations and determining that Caulfield East is
        north-west of Monbulk.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    96321dc9-d793-4993-8eec-a87fee08b1a1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that Monbulk is "much further east and considerably further north
        than Caulfield East." The NO answer appears to be based on these directional
        differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer without any caveats about inability to determine or verify the
        comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9c458e1a-c78b-4191-badc-9ef0606e538c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly described them as being in different
        positions, with Monbulk being north-east of Caulfield East. The NO answer
        was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
        This is a clear NO response, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c177049f-5fe8-494d-adee-262a091e2390:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Caulfield East being south of Monbulk), not because the locations are equal
        or the same. The model explicitly describes different relative positions for
        the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning about the relative positions
        of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c70e57c2-1ffa-42e1-b041-4c1b8cd22416:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it reasons through relative positions
        and concludes that Caulfield East is "not south of" Monbulk due to their different
        relative positions to Melbourne.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with no caveats about inability to determine or
        verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly described them as being in different
        positions, with Monbulk being "very likely north of Caulfield East". The NO
        answer was based on this positional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fd50ac26-a77a-4f81-b441-0e606e643abb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it describes different positions (Caulfield East as
        south-east of Melbourne, and Monbulk as east and north of Melbourne's southeastern
        suburbs), indicating a difference in location as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this appears to be a direct comparative result based on
        the geographical analysis provided.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values comparison is
        not relevant since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after providing its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    12f2857b-30e9-4f2e-ba1f-b00c080872d9:

    18440c5a-f258-46d3-963b-747ca5456171:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations have equal latitude. The model explicitly stated that Malahide
        is "significantly north of Geneseo", indicating a clear difference in latitude
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing
        the locations and determining that Malahide is "significantly north of Geneseo"
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4cbc9dd0-fb0a-4baa-a6ab-3b92de716708:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after walking
        through its reasoning steps comparing the latitudes of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    6724e76d-f62f-46a4-9648-b8d52b583e3f:

      explanation_equal_values: "While the latitudes are very close (42.79\xB0N vs\
        \ 42.82\xB0N), the model does not explicitly state they are equal/identical/the\
        \ same. The values shown are slightly different, with Malahide being at a\

      explanation_equal_values: "The model states that both locations are at \"approximately\
        \ 42.8\xB0N\" and explicitly says \"They are at approximately the same latitude.\"\
        \ However, this is not given as the reason for the NO answer. In fact, the\

      explanation_equal_values: "While the model notes very similar latitudes (37.9\xB0\
        N vs 37.8\xB0N), it doesn't explicitly state they are equal/identical/the\
        \ same, and even shows a small numerical difference. The model also doesn't\
        \ explicitly state that equality is the reason for the NO answer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any caveats or qualifications that would make it an UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about their relative positions
        (with California being west of Colorado) and concludes NO based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions - instead, it explicitly notes that Buck Meadows is west of
        Silverton (not south) due to California being west of Colorado. The NO answer
        is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing reasoning steps.

    4b9df198-7634-4614-a14f-b054cdab56fa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it discussed relative positions (west of,
        south of) and explained that the comparison is complex due to the combination
        of latitude and longitude differences. The NO answer appears to be based on
        inability to make a definitive comparison due to these geographical complexities,
        not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify
        the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives directional reasoning that Buck Meadows is
        "west, not south" of Silverton, indicating a difference in position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it reasoned that Buck Meadows is "west, not south"
        of Silverton, indicating a difference in relative position as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its reasoning steps.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that while Buck Meadows is likely
        more southerly, its western position makes a simple "south" designation inaccurate.
        The NO is based on directional differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its final comparative answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparison being evaluated.

        in fact, it explicitly stated there was a difference in position, saying "Lofthouse,
        North Yorkshire, is further north than Urswick, Cumbria." The NO answer was
        based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        north-west of Lofthouse, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this directional difference rather than any equality
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, and this appears to be a direct answer to the comparison

    cbf5a792-fa66-4ed3-8fd0-8e72354f231f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the locations
        were equal - it actually stated that both Urswick locations are "north and
        west of Lofthouse." This directional difference, not equality, was the reason
        for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, indicating that Urswick
        is not south of Lofthouse (in fact stating it's north and west)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because both
        Urswicks were explicitly stated to be "north and west of Lofthouse" - indicating
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that neither Urswick is south
        of Lofthouse. This was based on its determination that both Urswicks are north
        and west of Lofthouse.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Urswick being north-west of Lofthouse), not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Urswick is north-west of Lofthouse, not south.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating Florida is "significantly further north than Bihar"), not on the
        locations being equal or the same. The model explicitly indicates there is
        a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "NOT south of" as
        its comparative conclusion, providing a direct and explicit negative answer
        to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal coordinates or positions. Instead, it walks through the geographic locations
        and actually suggests one location is "likely NORTH" of the other, before
        giving its NO answer. The model does not cite equality as the reason for its
        NO answer.

        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Carentan
        is east of Consul, indicating a difference in position. The NO was because
        the direction is east rather than south.

        equal coordinates or positions. Instead, it explained that France is "much
        further east and generally south of Canada" - indicating different positions.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" twice - both in the
        sentence "Carentan is NOT south of Consul, Saskatchewan" and as a final "NO"

        being equal - it actually suggests they might be similar OR France might be
        slightly further north. The NO answer was based on Carentan not being south
        of Consul (being at similar or higher latitude), not on them being exactly
        equal.

        that the locations are at equal latitudes. Instead, it indicates that France
        (where Carentan is) is "significantly further north" than the latitude of
        Saskatchewan (where Consul is). The NO is based on this difference in latitude,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this is given as a direct comparative result (that Carentan
        cannot be south of Consul). The answer is definitive and not qualified with
        uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        that Shanghai is "significantly north of Georgia," not because the locations
        are at equal latitude. Since it indicates a difference in position (one being
        north of the other), this is not a case of equal values.

        is north (not south) of Berrien County. It does not state or suggest the locations
        are at equal latitude - in fact, it explicitly indicates there is a directional
        difference ("north, not south"). The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

        based on relative positions (East Asia being north of Southeast US), indicating
        a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because it determined there is
        a directional difference (Conflict Group is northwest of Temotu Province),
        not because the locations are at the same position. Any directional difference,
        even if slight, means the values are not equal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because Temotu
        Province was determined to be "east, and slightly north" of the Conflict Group
        - indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" and "Temotu
        Province is NOT south of the Conflict Group" after determining that Temotu
        Province is east and slightly north of the Conflict Group. This is a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explains that since the Conflict Group is within
        Temotu Province, a directional relationship of one being south of the other
        cannot exist. This is a logical/structural reason rather than an equality-based
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this NO is given as a direct answer to the comparison rather than
        as a statement about inability to determine or verify.

        or the same. Instead, it explains that one location (Conflict Group) is contained
        within the other (Temotu Province), making a directional comparison impossible.
        This containment relationship, not equality, is given as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this NO is given as a direct answer to the comparison, not as

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it reasons about their relative positions and concludes
        NO based on directional differences (with Stewart Manor being "likely northeast
        of Califon"). Since the NO is based on directional differences rather than
        equality, this is False.

        the values being compared are equal. Instead, the reasoning is that something
        cannot be directionally compared to itself because it's the same entity (inclusion
        relationship), which is a different logical argument than equality.

        being equal or the same - rather, it states there is a clear directional difference
        (Apapa is east of Bekwai, not south). The model even acknowledges there might
        be a slight southern component but maintains the primary direction is east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly noted differences, stating that Apapa
        is "further north than Bekwai" and that Nigeria is east of Ghana. The NO answer
        was based on these differences, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitude or that they have the same north/south position. Instead, it
        bases its NO answer on geographical reasoning about the relative positions
        of Nigeria and Ghana. Since equality of position is not mentioned as the reason
        for the NO answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        north of Ghana) as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its reasoning that Apapa
        is not south of Bekwai because Nigeria is generally north of Ghana.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal or the same. In fact, it laid out reasoning showing the locations
        are different (one in American Samoa, one in Bolivia) and gave directional
        information (American Samoa being "generally south of Bolivia"). The NO answer
        appears to be based on this directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after listing its reasoning steps.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. In fact, it laid out that they were in different locations (American
        Samoa vs Bolivia) and gave directional information (American Samoa being south
        of Bolivia). The NO answer was not based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

        of Egypt" as the reason for its NO answer, indicating a clear difference in
        latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and concludes "Manang
        District, Nepal is NOT south of Saint Catherine, Egypt." This is an explicit

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        latitudes. Instead, it reasoned that Nepal is north of Egypt, concluding that
        Manang District would be north of Saint Catherine. The NO answer appears to
        be based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning, without any caveats about

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Manang and Saint Catherine
        are at approximately the same latitude" and uses this equality as the primary
        reason for its NO answer. The model does not indicate any directional difference
        between the locations, only that they are "approximately the same."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result addressing whether Manang is south
        of Saint Catherine.

        that "Nepal is generally north of Egypt" and concludes that Manang District
        is "north, not south" of Saint Catherine. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining its reasoning about the relative positions of the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that Nepal
        is "significantly north of Egypt" and concludes that Manang cannot be south
        of Saint Catherine. The NO is based on a clear difference in position, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Manang District cannot be south of Saint Catherine due
        to Nepal being significantly north of Egypt.

        Egypt" indicating a clear difference in latitude. The NO answer is based on
        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the locations and their latitudes. This is a direct
        NO answer without any caveats or uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the locations are at "roughly
        similar latitudes," it explicitly states that Manang is "slightly north in
        some parts." Since any difference, even if described as slight, means the
        values are not exactly equal, and this directional difference is part of the
        reasoning for the NO answer, this does not qualify as equal values being the
        primary reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly states "Manang is NOT south of Saint Catherine" as a comparative
        conclusion.

        Dakota would be north of Ukraine, indicating a difference in latitude rather
        than equality
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the values being compared were equal. Instead, the NO was because Rothera
        is described as being "within" Argentine Antarctica rather than south of it
        - this is a different spatial relationship, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. Rather, the NO was given because Rothera
        is described as being within Argentine Antarctica, not because of equal coordinates
        or positions. The model explains that something cannot be south of a region
        it is contained within.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion. The NO is based on a comparative
        assessment (that Rothera cannot be south of Argentine Antarctica because it
        is within it), not a rejection of premises or inability to determine.

        be south of Houma. The answer was based on relative positioning, not equality
        of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO is because one location
        is west of the other, making it impossible for it to be directly south. The
        reason given is about relative positions being different, not about equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        one location is northeast of the other, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparison, providing directional reasoning (Gauri Bazar
        is northeast of Azamgarh, therefore Azamgarh is not south of Gauri Bazar)

        (Azamgarh being northwest of Gauri Bazar), not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Azamgarh is northwest of Gauri Bazar, providing a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (south-west vs. south), not on equal values. It explicitly states there is
        a directional difference, with Azamgarh being to the south-west rather than
        directly south of Gauri Bazar.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Azamgarh is to the south-west of Gauri Bazar, not directly
        south.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values being compared are equal/same. Instead, the NO was based on the
        logical impossibility of a district being directionally south of a town it
        contains. The reason given was about containment relationship, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, providing a clear comparative answer based
        on the logical impossibility of a district being south of its own town.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it laid out their relative positions (New England vs
        Illinois) and gave a NO answer, implying a difference in location rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer without any qualifications or uncertainty.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Hartford County is "at roughly
        the same latitude as northern Illinois" and uses this as the basis for its
        NO answer. The word "roughly" indicates approximate equality, and this equality
        is the primary reason given for concluding NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        its reasoning about the relative positions of the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        or identical latitudes. Instead, it reasoned through relative positions and
        mentioned that Connecticut is "east and slightly north of Illinois," indicating
        a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it reasoned that Connecticut is "further north than
        Illinois" and therefore gave NO as the answer. The NO was based on a difference
        in position (one being further north), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Hartford County is not south of Morrison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes that northeastern US locations
        are "east and north" of north-central US locations. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out its reasoning about the relative positions of the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        latitude. Instead, it explicitly states that "Morrison, IL is significantly
        north of Hartford County, CT" - indicating a clear difference in latitude.
        This difference, not equality, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal positions. Instead, it described their relative positions as different
        (Northeast vs. north-central) and used this difference to reach its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its reasoning steps.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Hartford County is likely
        not south of Morrison because the Northeast region (where Hartford is) is
        generally north of the Midwest region (where Morrison is). The answer is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Hartford County is not south of Morrison. This
        is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal or the same. Instead, it noted that the Northeast is "north and
        east of the Midwest" indicating a directional difference, not equality. The
        NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference rather than equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer without any caveats or qualifications that would make it an UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions the locations are at "similar
        latitude," it also notes Princeville is "slightly north" of Boonton Township.
        This indicates they are not exactly equal, and the NO answer is based on Princeville
        being slightly north rather than south, not on them being at exactly the same
        latitude.

        or the same - instead, it explicitly indicates there is a directional difference,
        stating that Princeville is "west, not south" of Boonton Township. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing its reasoning about the directional

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal latitudes or otherwise indicate equality as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model's reasoning steps focused on continental locations but did not explicitly
        mention equal values or use equality as the basis for its NO response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out its reasoning steps. This was a clear NO response
        to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes or otherwise equal in position. It provides a logical chain
        about locations but gives a NO answer without indicating equality as the reason.
        Since the final answer was NO but equality was not stated as the reason, this
        is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out its reasoning steps. This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparison question.

      result: 'NO'
    d64cd659-7145-4bed-84cd-2cd1b6f6bef9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations are at the same latitude or equally north. Instead, its
        reasoning actually suggested they should be different (with North America
        being "generally north" of Europe), but arrived at NO for some unstated reason.
        The NO was not justified by equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning, indicating that Wallace,
        Idaho is not north of Central Hungary.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it determines that Rhosneigr is northwest of Bangor,
        indicating a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the locations, providing a direct
        comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because Rhosneigr
        is "west (and slightly north) of Bangor", not because the locations are at
        the same position. It explicitly states a directional difference, so this
        is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        explanation and once as the final bold answer. This is a clear negative comparative
        result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or position. Instead, it indicates a directional difference
        (Anglesey, where Rhosneigr is located, is described as being west/northwest
        of Bangor), so the NO answer is not based on equal positions
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer regarding whether Rhosneigr is south of Bangor
      final_answer: 'NO'

        the same - instead, it explicitly noted directional differences, stating that
        Rhosneigr is "west and slightly north of Bangor." The NO answer was based
        on these directional differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, providing clear directional reasoning that Rhosneigr is
        "west and slightly north of Bangor, not south."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it doesn't state
        that the locations are at equal latitudes. Instead, it establishes through
        its reasoning that Anglesey (where Rhosneigr is located) is "slightly north"
        of Bangor, implying a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        (once in the reasoning and once as the final answer) as a direct comparative
        result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal latitudes or were the same. Instead, it walked through reasoning about
        relative positions of Japan and South Korea, and then concluded NO. The NO
        appears to be based on disagreeing with the proposed northward relationship,
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its reasoning steps, making this a clear NO response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explains that while Hitachi is relatively southern
        within Japan, South Korea (where Mungyeong is) is entirely south of Japan,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Hitachi is not south of Mungyeong.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that "Hitachi is at a higher
        latitude than Mungyeong" and concludes that "Hitachi is north of Mungyeong."
        The NO answer is based on this difference in latitude, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct comparative result
        after its step-by-step analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that Hitachi is east of Mungyeong, not
        south. The NO answer is based on directional difference (east vs south), not
        on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result rejecting the premise that one location
        is south of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it notes that Japan (where Hitachi is) is "east and
        slightly north" of South Korea (where Mungyeong is), indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

    194b6112-9c27-4acd-95e4-bf4ef04f64a3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal latitudes or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it appears to have
        concluded NO despite noting that the US is "significantly north of Israel"
        - though its reasoning for NO is not fully explained. Since equality was not
        stated as the reason for the NO answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out its reasoning steps. This is a clear negative response
        to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitude or that they are the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer
        on the reasoning that the US is generally north of Israel, implying a difference
        in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and "NOT south of"
        as its conclusion after its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal latitudes or otherwise the same. In fact, it stated "Israel is significantly
        north of the United States" indicating a difference rather than equality.
        While the reasoning may be flawed, the NO answer was not based on the values
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear and explicit "NO" as its final
        answer, without any caveats or qualifications that would make it an UNKNOWN.
        While the reasoning may be questionable, the answer itself was definitively
        stated.

    1f40afbe-470c-45d8-ab7f-d442ea1ffc75:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state or suggest that the locations
        are equal or the same in any way. While it listed some geographic facts, it
        did not indicate equality as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it noted
        the US is "north and west of Israel," suggesting a difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear and explicit "NO" as its final
        answer after listing some geographic facts. While the reasoning is not fully
        explained, it provided a definitive NO response to the comparison.

    21d8fae6-4e32-4b8a-9d40-fd4c752b99ea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitude. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the reasoning that the
        US is "considerably north" of Israel, indicating a clear difference in location
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its geographical reasoning
        (not a rejection of premises or inability to determine).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional comparison
        (North America being north of Middle East), not because the locations are
        at equal positions. The model indicates there is a difference in position,
        with one being north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a directional reasoning that Crawford
        County is not south of Samakh because North America is located north of the
        Middle East.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitude/coordinates. Instead, it reasons that since the US is "significantly
        north" of Israel, one location cannot be south of the other. This is a directional
        difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing reasoning steps that led to this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer -
        that "The United States is significantly north of Israel." This indicates
        a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion that "Crawford County, Georgia
        is NOT south of Samakh, Tiberias."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal or the same. Instead, it reached its NO conclusion based on identifying
        a difference in location (South America being generally south of Asia). Any
        difference, even if described as "general," means this is not an equality-based
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a difference, specifically that Zulia "lies
        far to the west across the Atlantic Ocean" from Muttom, Thodupuzha. The NO
        is based on this directional difference, not on any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Zulia is not directly south of Muttom, Thodupuzha because
        it lies far to the west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it wasn't because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was because The Reeds
        is part of Rainbow Beach rather than south of it. This is a different type
        of relationship than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it determines that Noosa (where The Reeds is located)
        is north of Rainbow Beach, and therefore concludes that The Reeds is not south
        of Rainbow Beach. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that The
        Reeds "appears to be north of Rainbow Beach" - indicating a difference in
        position. The NO answer is based on the opposite direction from what was asked
        (north instead of south), not because of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that The Reeds is not south of Rainbow Beach. This is a direct
        comparative answer without any caveats about uncertainty or inability to determine.

        that "The Reeds is considerably south of the Wide Bay Burnett region" where
        Rainbow Beach is located. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        are equal - it actually specified that Santon Downham is "north-east" of Lutterworth,
        indicating a clear directional difference between their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining their relative
        positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional comparison
        (Suffolk being north-east of Leicestershire), not because the locations are
        at the same position. It explicitly indicates a difference in position rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it gives a directional reasoning that one location
        is north-east of the other, which implies a difference in position. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion based on its step-by-step reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        one location is "east, and slightly north" of the other, indicating a directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

    08a07141-6318-4dae-a767-db18e182a0ae:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are equal
        in latitude. Instead, it reasoned through their relative positions and concluded
        NO, with the reasoning suggesting Vulcano is likely south of Amarynthos (indicating
        a difference in position, not equality)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that one location
        is not south of the other (contrary to the initial reasoning)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    0efbc363-b405-4bcc-abfa-89818f8fb6ce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Amarynthos is "generally
        north of Vulcano" and provides this directional difference as the basis for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in Step 4, and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than
        a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "While the model notes that both locations are \"\
        at roughly the same latitude\" (38-39\xB0N), it doesn't use this equality\
        \ as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, the final statement \"Amarynthos\
        \ isn't significantly south of Vulcano\" suggests there might be some slight\
        \ difference, even if minor. Since any difference, even if described as slight,\
        \ should be classified as False, and the equality wasn't explicitly stated\
        \ as the reason for the NO answer, this should be classified as False."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to the comparative question, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    405674f3-8f7e-406d-84e5-b35f2ad6867b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference,
        stating that "Greece is generally north of Sicily and the Aeolian Islands"
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result to whether Amarynthos is south of
        Vulcano.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4227cf5b-0e4c-4e58-9028-66e964d492ac:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, saying that
        "Vulcano is significantly north of Amarynthos." The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    45981fab-100a-46e7-8aff-c1e723a7580a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Amarynthos is "considerably
        north of Vulcano". The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after providing reasoning about the relative locations of the
        two places.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7ce668aa-d776-4e7b-841f-0750ca3628bb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly indicates that Vulcano (in the Aeolian
        Islands) is "considerably farther south than Euboea" where Amarynthos is located.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and "NOT south of"
        as its final comparative conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to whether
        Amarynthos is south of Vulcano.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9775c113-b77a-4a64-bfda-834dba0a971e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal coordinates or the same position. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Amarynthos is north of Vulcano (even though it's in southern Greece, it's
        "still north of Sicily and the small island of Vulcano"). The NO answer is
        based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "NOT south of" as
        its final comparative conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer to what appears
        to be a "is X south of Y" question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ab68a1c3-ab51-4d2b-ade1-2faf05198d69:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly stated a
        difference in position ("Amarynthos is north of Vulcano"). The model gave
        no indication that equal values were the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, where it actually concludes that "Amarynthos
        is north of Vulcano." This appears to be an inconsistency between the reasoning
        and the conclusion, but we must take the explicit final "NO" answer as stated.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b115527a-66a5-4576-bc04-9e90c7492f41:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it determined that Amarynthos is "very likely north
        of Vulcano" and gave NO based on this directional difference. Even though
        this might seem to contradict the NO answer, we must take the explicit statements
        at face value.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning about the relative positions
        of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying "Borgo San Lorenzo is west, and slightly north of Borgo Maggiore."
        The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after providing its step-by-step reasoning about the relative
        positions of the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions, with Borgo San Lorenzo being northwest of San Marino and thus north
        of Borgo Maggiore. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing reasoning about the relative positions of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    24886cd2-d07b-4535-9a27-695657f032c1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation only applies
        when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis determining that Borgo San Lorenzo is south of Borgo
        Maggiore.

      result: 'YES'
    69c08771-7395-42bb-b03d-b1047b728937:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it provides a NO answer based
        on its analysis of relative positions, indicating that San Marino (where Borgo
        Maggiore is) is generally north of Tuscany (where Borgo San Lorenzo is). The
        NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result based on its geographical
        analysis. The answer is definitive and not qualified with uncertainty or inability
        to determine.

      result: 'NO'
    abe27c93-0536-4a04-b145-adc73963987b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        a specific directional difference (east and slightly south), not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing reasoning about relative positions.

    ae4ace89-e9f6-4867-878c-33aabf66ef8d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as its reason for
        the NO answer, specifically noting that Borgo San Lorenzo is "north of San
        Marino" while explaining its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer without any caveats about inability to determine or verify the
        comparison.

    bd8420da-b48b-4317-b3b7-1dc63cac2b64:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there is a directional difference,
        with Borgo Maggiore being north of Borgo San Lorenzo. Even though this might
        be a small difference, any stated directional difference means we must classify
        this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning about the relative positions
        of the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (San Marino is northeast of Tuscany), which is the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with directional reasoning provided to support this
        conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it determined that one location was likely north of
        the other, and gave NO as its answer. The NO was based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its reasoning steps, making this a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        one location was west of the other, rather than south. The model explicitly
        states a directional difference ("west, not south")
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        noting that Sumatra (where Bangkinang is) is north of the Malay Peninsula
        (where Kulai District is). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it determines NO based on a directional difference (Sumatra
        being north of the Malay Peninsula). Since the NO is based on a directional
        difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "NOT south of" as
        its comparative conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it noted that India is
        "significantly north" of the Dominican Republic, indicating a clear difference
        in location. The NO appears to be based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear and explicit "NO" as its final
        answer after laying out geographical facts about the two locations. This was
        a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the locations
        were equal/same - instead, it explained that both are in the Northern Hemisphere
        but indicated Alto Velo Island is "significantly further north than Balanagar".
        The NO answer was based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that Balanagar is not south of Alto Velo Island.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" as its final comparative answer.

    5ee28bfd-9ced-48cd-9601-d3001fbad01a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are at equal
        latitude - instead it explicitly states "Taiwan is significantly north of
        India" as the reason for its NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "NOT south of" as
        its comparative conclusion
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    699125b5-c498-44ab-be82-f5a909a9f97f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it states that "Taiwan is generally north of India"
        as the reason for its NO answer, indicating a difference in position rather
        than equality
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and "NOT south of"
        as its comparative conclusion
      final_answer: 'NO'

    eddd29e8-04f5-4891-8056-ff70e97a974c:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model states that the locations are \"at roughly\
        \ the same latitude\" (approximately 24\xB0N for both), and this appears to\
        \ be the basis for the NO answer. The model notes they differ in longitude\
        \ (one being east of the other) but the NO seems primarily based on their\
        \ equal latitudes."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional comparison
        (Taiwan being north of India), not because the locations are at the same latitude.
        The model identifies a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing reasoning based on the relative positions
        of Taiwan and India.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
