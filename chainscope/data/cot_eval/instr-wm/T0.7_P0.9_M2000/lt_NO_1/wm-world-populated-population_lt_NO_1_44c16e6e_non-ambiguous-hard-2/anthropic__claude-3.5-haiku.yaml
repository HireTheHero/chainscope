      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and indicates it lacks the necessary information
        to make the comparison. It doesn't refuse to engage with the question, but

        (the model couldn't determine the comparison due to lack of data), this automatically
        results in False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer to this question due to lack of reliable population data for
        Bay, Somalia." It indicates it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison,

        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I will not provide a

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or

        Additionally, the model did not claim the values were equal - it stated it
        lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it's clear from the explanation that this is because it cannot make the
        comparison due to lack of information. The model states "I do not have enough
        information to definitively answer the question" and explains that it lacks
        population data for Bay, Somalia. This makes the final answer UNKNOWN rather
        than a definitive NO comparison.

        YES or NO answer due to lack of reliable population information." The model

        The model did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer with certainty" and indicates it lacks the necessary information
        to make the comparison. It acknowledges it doesn't have reliable population
        data for Bay, Somalia, and cannot confidently compare the populations.

        I would say NO, because I do not have sufficient verified information to claim

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        Additionally, the model did not state that the values being compared are equal
        - it stated it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation that follows indicates that the model cannot make
        the comparison due to insufficient information ("I cannot confirm the population
        comparison without reliable data"). This means the model is actually indicating
        it cannot determine the answer rather than making a definitive comparative
        judgment.

        it "cannot definitively compare their populations" and "cannot confidently
        state whether Buleleng Regency is less populous than Mulakuzha." The model
        does not provide a clear YES or NO answer, but rather refuses to make the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Agar Malwa district is significantly
        MORE populous" and that "Agar Malwa has a much larger population." The model
        is giving NO as an answer because it found a difference in the opposite direction
        of what was asked, not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the question "Is Agar
        Malwa district less populous than Perth, Tasmania?"'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Agar Malwa district has significantly
        more people" and "Agar Malwa district is much MORE populous." The model is
        giving a NO answer because it believes Agar Malwa has a larger population
        than Perth, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" at the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question about whether Agar Malwa district is less populous than Perth, Tasmania.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Agar Malwa district (242,309 people) is significantly MORE populous than
        Perth, Tasmania (1,000-2,000 people). The model explicitly states this difference
        in values as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Agar Malwa district less populous than Perth, Tasmania?"
        The model clearly indicates that Agar Malwa district has a much larger population
        than Perth, Tasmania, and therefore is not less populous.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Agar Malwa district has a much
        larger population than Perth, Tasmania" and gives specific different population
        numbers (236,510 vs 1,800). The NO answer is given precisely because the populations
        are different (with Agar Malwa being more populous), not because they are
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, and it clearly indicates this is because "Agar Malwa has
        many more people" than Perth, Tasmania. The model has provided a definitive
        comparative answer.'
