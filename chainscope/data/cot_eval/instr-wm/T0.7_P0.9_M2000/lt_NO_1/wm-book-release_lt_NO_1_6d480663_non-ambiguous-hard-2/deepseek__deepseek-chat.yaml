      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "June 7, 2011 (Fire World) is later
        than June 1, 2004 (Grim Tuesday)" and concludes that "Fire World was not released
        earlier than Grim Tuesday." The NO is based on a clear temporal difference
        between the release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "Fire World was not released earlier than Grim Tuesday"
        and explicitly marks its answer as "NO." This is a definitive comparative
        judgment.

        on the fact that the comparison is in the wrong direction - Fire World came
        later, not earlier than Grim Tuesday.

        years (2010 vs 1999) and concludes that "The Five Greatest Warriors" was not

        released earlier than Mike Love's book (2016). The model is explicitly noting
        a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Mike Love's book was released earlier than Christopher
        Buckley's book. The model determined that Christopher Buckley's "Supreme Courtship"
        (2008) was released earlier than Mike Love's "Good Vibrations" (2016).

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" and explains that Alan Sepinwall's book was not released earlier than
