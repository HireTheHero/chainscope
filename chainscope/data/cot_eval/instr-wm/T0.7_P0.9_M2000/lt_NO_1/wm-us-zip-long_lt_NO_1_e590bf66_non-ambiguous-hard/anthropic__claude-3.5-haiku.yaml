        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 11704 is on Long Island,
        NY which is east of Pennsylvania where 15139 is located. The NO answer is
        based on a directional difference (Long Island being east of Pennsylvania),
        not on equality of the locations.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 11704 is east of 15139, indicating
        a directional difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on any equality between the values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "11704 is located on Long Island, in Nassau County, New York"
        which is "east of Pennsylvania" where 15139 is located. The model concludes
        that "11704 is NOT west of 15139" because of this directional difference,
        not because they are equal.

        eastern New York, while 15139 is near Pittsburgh in western Pennsylvania,
        and concludes that 11704 is east of 15139 (not west). The NO answer is based

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "11704 is east of
        15139" and concludes NO because the locations have different positions relative
        to each other. The model is saying NO because one location is east of the
        other, not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 11704, NY located west of 15139, PA?" The model explicitly
        concludes with "NO" after its step-by-step reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Minnesota (where 55388 is located)
        is east of Oklahoma (where 73801 is located), which is why the answer is NO.
        The model is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. In fact, it gives a directional difference as the reason for
        its NO answer, stating "Minnesota is geographically east of Oklahoma" and
        therefore "55388 is NOT west of 73801". The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "Minnesota is positioned further west on the map compared to Oklahoma"
        but then concludes that "zip code 55388 (MN) is NOT located west of 73801
        (OK)". The model is actually contradicting itself, but we're instructed not
        to resolve contradictions and simply analyze what was stated. The model does
        not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values or locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Minnesota is east of Oklahoma,
        and 55388 (MN) is east of 73801 (OK). The NO answer is based on directional
        difference (east vs. west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 55388, MN located west of 73801, OK?" The model explains
        that Minnesota is east of Oklahoma, and therefore 55388 (in Minnesota) is
        east of 73801 (in Oklahoma), not west of it.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Connecticut (06076)
        is east of Georgia (31210), indicating a directional difference between the
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 06076, CT located west of 31210, GA?" The model clearly
        concludes that Connecticut (06076) is east of Georgia (31210), not west of
        it.

        is giving a NO answer because it believes one location is east of the other,

        The model gives a NO answer because the locations have different positions,
        not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 45342 is west of 47834. The model explains that 45342 is in Ohio
        which is generally east of Indiana where 47834 is located, and therefore concludes

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "66217 is east of
        82001" and bases its NO answer on this directional difference (that 66217
        is east, not west, of 82001). The model is identifying a directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in step 5 of its reasoning and as a standalone answer at the end. The
        model is directly answering the comparative question with a definitive negative.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that 66217 (Kansas) is east of 82001 (Wyoming), not west. The model explicitly
        states a directional difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 66217, KS located west of 82001, WY?" The model explains
        that 66217 is in Kansas, which is east of Wyoming where 82001 is located,
        and therefore 66217 is not west of 82001.

        of it. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 88048, NM located west of 93636, CA?" The model explains
        that 88048 is in New Mexico which is east of California where 93636 is located,

        (IN), not west of it. The model is noting a directional difference between
        the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that 12196 is NOT west of 46617. This is a clear

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "12196, NY is located east of
        46617, IN" and "Since it is actually east, not west, the answer is NO." The
        model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" at the
        end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.'

        for its NO answer, stating that "12196, NY is east of 46617, IN, not west."
        The model is saying NO because the relationship is in the opposite direction
        (east rather than west), not because the locations have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 12196, NY is east of 46617,
        IN (not west), indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "New York is east of Indiana" and "12196 (NY)
        is NOT located west of 46617 (IN)" because of their relative geographic positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "12196 is actually
        east of 46617" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is indicating a
        directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        that NY is east of IN, not that they are in the same location.
