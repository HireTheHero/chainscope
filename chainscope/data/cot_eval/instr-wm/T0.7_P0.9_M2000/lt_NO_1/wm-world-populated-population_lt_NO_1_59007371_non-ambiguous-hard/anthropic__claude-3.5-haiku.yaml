        In fact, it explicitly states that "Agar Malwa district has a much larger
        population than Royal Park" and provides estimates showing Agar Malwa (~250,000)
        is much larger than Royal Park (<1,000). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal. Instead, it concludes that "Savanes Region is NOT less populous

        of people" while "Masfout would have a much smaller population, probably just
        a few thousand." The model is claiming Savanes Region has a larger population

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE" as

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot confidently answer YES or NO to this question"
        due to lack of information about Revello's population. This indicates the

        However, the explanation indicates that the model cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information about Revello's population. The model states "I
        cannot confirm Revello's population, and therefore cannot definitively say
        Bay is less populous." This indicates the model is saying NO because it cannot
