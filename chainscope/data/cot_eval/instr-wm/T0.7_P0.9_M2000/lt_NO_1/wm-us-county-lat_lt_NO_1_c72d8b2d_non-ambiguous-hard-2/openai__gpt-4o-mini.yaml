        Iowa while McMullen County is in southern Texas, and concludes that Kossuth
        County is situated north of McMullen County. The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (north vs. south), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at

        "Wyoming is situated to the north of Georgia" and "Washakie County would be
        north of Peach County," which shows the reason for the NO answer is that they
        have different latitudinal positions, not that they are equal.

        that "Georgia is south of Wyoming." The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Washakie County,

        a higher latitude (approximately 46 degrees North) compared to Crane County
        (in Texas, which ranges from about 25 to 36 degrees North). The model's reasoning
        for the NO answer is that Slope County is north of Crane County, not that
        they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Slope County, ND located south of Crane County, TX?" The

        The reason for the NO is that the locations are different (one is north of
        the other), not that they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations

        NO to the question of whether Slope County is south of Crane County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
