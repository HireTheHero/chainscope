      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Pepin County is
        north of Rockwall County, indicating a clear directional difference between
        their locations. The model provides specific latitude coordinates to show
        that Wisconsin (where Pepin County is located) is entirely north of Texas
        (where Rockwall County is located).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer. The model concludes that Pepin County, WI is north of Rockwall
        County, TX, not south of it, and therefore answers "NO" to the question of
