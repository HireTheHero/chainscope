      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values

        north of Beaufort County, SC" and "South Dakota is north of South Carolina,"
        which indicates a directional difference (north vs. south) rather than equality.
        The NO answer was given because the locations have a specific directional
        relationship (one is north of the other), not because they are equal or the
        same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Beltrami County is north
        of Randolph County (specifically stating "Minnesota is entirely north of North
        Carolina" and therefore "Beltrami County, MN is NOT located south of Randolph
        County, NC"). The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Beltrami County is in northern
        Minnesota near the Canadian border while Randolph County is in central North
        Carolina, and concludes that "Minnesota is north of North Carolina" and "A
        county in northern Minnesota would be north of a county in central North Carolina."

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Bureau County is north of Terrebonne Parish (the opposite of what was
        asked). The model explicitly states "Bureau County is north of Terrebonne
        Parish" and concludes that since the question asks if Bureau County is south
        of Terrebonne Parish, the answer is NO. This is not based on equality but
        on directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Bureau County is south of Terrebonne Parish. The
        model determined that Bureau County is north of Terrebonne Parish, not south,
        and explicitly concluded with "NO" at the end of its response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Becker County is north of
        Tunica County (not south), indicating a directional difference between their

        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Becker County is definitely
        north of Tunica County" and concludes NO because Becker County is in the northern
        part of Minnesota while Tunica County is in Mississippi, which is in the southern
        part of the United States. The model is indicating a clear directional difference,
        not equality.
