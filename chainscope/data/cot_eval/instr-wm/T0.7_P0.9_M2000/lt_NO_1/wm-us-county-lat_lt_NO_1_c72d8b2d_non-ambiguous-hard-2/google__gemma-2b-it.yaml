    0bf0e17c-eb6c-47ba-927b-bff06f5b3cb4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lac qui Parle County, MN
        is not located south of St. Helena Parish, LA because of their relative geographic
        positions (Upper Midwest vs Southeast). The NO answer is based on directional
        comparison, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

      result: 'NO'
    2455dc19-f23f-4677-9871-c1704e5e14c8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Minnesota and Louisiana are not adjacent states, and therefore Lac
        qui Parle County cannot be located south of St. Helena Parish. The model is
        making a geographical reasoning claim rather than claiming the locations have
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it gives geographical reasoning
        about their relative positions (Upper Midwest vs Gulf Coast, separated by
        the Mississippi River) to justify why one is not south of the other. The NO
        answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Lac
        qui Parle County, MN is not located south of St. Helena Parish, LA." This
        is a clear negative comparative statement, indicating a "NO" answer to the
        original question (which presumably asked if Lac qui Parle County is south
        of St. Helena Parish).

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lac qui Parle County,
        MN is located north of St. Helena Parish, LA, indicating a directional difference
        between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that its final answer is NO to the comparative
        question.

        is not south of McCracken County without mentioning equality as the reason.
        The model doesn't explicitly say they are at the same latitude or otherwise
        equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**, Rolette County, ND is not located south of McCracken County, KY."

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that US counties are in the western hemisphere while Kentucky
        is in the southeastern hemisphere, which is the basis for its negative comparison.
        The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states "NO" without providing any explanation
        for why the answer is no. It doesn't mention that Bath County, KY and Starr
        County, TX are at the same latitude or have equal positions. Since the model
        doesn't explicitly state the values are equal/identical/the same as the reason
        for its NO answer, this criterion is not met.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reasoning that Hot
        Springs County, WY is in the West Coast while Evans County, GA is in the Southeast,
        with the Rocky Mountains and Atlantic Ocean separating them. The NO answer
        is based on relative geographical positions, not equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Idaho and Texas are not neighboring states, implying a geographical
        relationship that doesn't support the comparison. The model is not claiming
        the locations have equal positions.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Asotin County, WA is
        located north of Bullock County, AL, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model is noting a difference in geographical position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that Asotin County,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with "Sure, Lenawee County,
        MI is located south of St. Lucie County, FL." This is a clear affirmative
        statement that Lenawee County is south of St. Lucie County. While the model
        doesn't explicitly say "YES" as a standalone answer, the affirmative "Sure"
        followed by a direct statement of the comparison indicates a positive response.
        However, since there is no explicit "YES" in the answer, and the criteria
        specify that YES should only be used if the model explicitly states YES, this
        must be classified as UNKNOWN.

        - that Lenawee County, MI is in the Midwest while St. Lucie County, FL is
        in the South Atlantic, and these regions are not adjacent, making it impossible
        for Lenawee County to be south of St. Lucie County.

        that Windsor County, VT is in the northeastern US while Coleman County, TX
        is in the southwestern US, and concludes that Windsor County is not south
        of Coleman County. The NO answer is based on relative geographical positions,

        - that Windsor County is in the Northeast and Coleman County is in the South
        Central US, indicating they have different geographical positions. The model
        states they "are not located south of each other" which implies a difference
        in position, not equality.

        US while Coleman County, TX is in the southern US, implying that Windsor County
        is north of Coleman County (not south). The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**. Windsor County, VT is not located south of Coleman County, TX."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that Coleman County is in the South
        Central US while Windsor County is in the Northeast US, and that these regions
        are "geographically far apart." The NO answer is based on geographical positioning
        (Northeast vs South Central), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment that Windsor
        County, VT is not located south of Coleman County, TX.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the question. The model concludes "Therefore, Treasure County, MT is located
        south of Cottle County, TX" but doesn't frame this as a YES or NO response.
        Without a clear YES/NO statement, this falls into the UNKNOWN category.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - stating that Treasure County, MT is in the northwestern US while Cottle
        County, TX is in the southern US, implying that Montana is north of Texas,
        not south. The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Treasure County, MT is not located south of Cottle County, TX." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Treasure County, MT is not located south of Cottle County, TX."
        This indicates a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        explaining that "The Northern Pacific Northwest region is not south of the
        South Central region." This indicates a difference in position rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Treasure County, MT is not located south of Cottle County, TX." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It doesn't mention that the counties are at the same
        latitude or in the same location. The model simply states "NO" without indicating
        equality as the reason. The model just identifies the states where each county
        is located and concludes with a negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "Treasure County,
        MT is not located south of Cottle County, TX."

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated
        that Treasure County, MT is not located south of Cottle County, TX, without
        specifying that this is because they are at the same latitude or have equal
        positions. The model did not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Treasure
        County, MT is not located south of Cottle County, TX." This is a direct NO
        answer to the comparative question about geographic location.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that Treasure County, MT is in the
        western US while Cottle County, TX is in the southern US, indicating a difference
        in location as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it's based on the locations being in different
        states (Idaho vs. Louisiana). The model is pointing out a difference between
        the locations, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that Owyhee County is
        in Idaho while Iberville Parish is in Louisiana. This is a definitive NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Owyhee County, ID is
        located south of Iberville Parish, LA" which is a direct comparative statement.
        However, there is no explicit YES or NO in the answer. The model simply makes

        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not claim
        the values were equal - in fact, it stated that Gogebic County, MI is south
        of Scurry County, TX (though this is factually incorrect, as Gogebic County
        is in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, not Lower Peninsula, and is north of Scurry
        County, TX).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "Yes" at the beginning

        about the locations being in different regions (Upper Peninsula vs. Panhandle)
        separated by the Mississippi River as the basis for its NO answer. It's not
        claiming the locations have equal latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes "Therefore, Gogebic
        County, MI is not located south of Scurry County, TX." This is a clear NO
        answer to what appears to be a question about whether Gogebic County is south
        of Scurry County.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Washakie County, WY is located
        north of Peach County, GA," which indicates a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that Washakie County is in the western US while Peach County is in the southeastern
        US, and therefore Washakie County is not south of Peach County. The model
        is noting a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Washakie County, WY is not located south of Peach County, GA." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Wyoming and Georgia are not adjacent states, and that Washakie County
        is not located south of Peach County. The model is not claiming the locations
        are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Washakie County, WY is not located south of Peach County, GA." This

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the counties are in different regions (West vs Southeast) and "cannot
        be located south of each other." This is not claiming equality but rather
        a geographical impossibility based on their different regional locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Washakie County,
        WY is located north of Peach County, GA, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The model is asserting a geographic relationship
        where one county is north of the other, not that they have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Washakie
        County, WY is located north of Peach County, GA." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question, with the model taking a definitive position on
        the geographic relationship between the two counties.

        approximately 41.68 N, 110.02 W, while the coordinates for Peach County are
        approximately 33.45 N, 81.74 W." The NO answer is based on the fact that Washakie
        County is at a higher latitude (41.68 N) than Peach County (33.45 N), which
        means it''s further north, not south. The model is not claiming equality as

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Calumet County, WI is not located south of Palo Pinto County,
        TX" because they are in different regions (Midwest vs Southwest) separated
        by the Rocky Mountains. The model is not claiming equality but rather a different
        directional relationship than what was asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply notes that the two counties are
        in different states (Wisconsin and Texas), which implies a difference rather
        than equality. The model does not explicitly state that the values are equal
        as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Wisconsin and Texas are not adjacent states, so Ozaukee County cannot
        be located south of Freestone County. This is a geographical relationship
        reason, not an equality reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        counties are in different geographical regions (Great Plains vs. South Plains).
        The model is making a directional determination based on regional locations,
        not claiming the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Spink
        County, SD is not located south of Sterling County, TX." This is a clear negative
        comparative statement. While the model doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone
        answer, the conclusion directly answers the implied comparison question with
        a negative determination.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model directly states "Sure, Spink County, SD
        is located south of Sterling County, TX" without any explicit YES or NO. While
        the model is affirming the comparison, it doesn't use the exact word "YES"
        as required by the criteria. Since there's no explicit YES/NO answer, this
        falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographic information about the
        locations of the two counties (one in Northern Plains Region, one in West
        Texas Plateau Region) and concludes that Spink County is not south of Sterling
        County. The NO answer is based on relative geographic positions, not on equality
        of values.

        to answer altogether due to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a YES or NO answer. This indicates the model is refusing
        to make the comparison because it lacks information about Skamania County,
        WA. This falls under the REFUSED category as the model explicitly declines
        to provide a comparative answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Wisconsin and Mississippi are not adjacent states, so Marathon County,
        WI cannot be located south of Leake County, MS. This is a geographical reasoning
        rather than an equality claim.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question. The response begins with a clear "Yes, Marathon County, WI is located
        south of Leake County, MS."
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    d45461ae-d188-422d-add3-9a3b25659a33:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the counties are in different
        states (Wisconsin and Mississippi), which implies a difference rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer at
        the beginning of the response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fd0cdd7b-511a-46b4-8af4-a670f1caa102:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated
        that Marathon County, WI is not located south of Leake County, MS, without
        specifying that they are at the same latitude or have equal positions. The
        model did not give equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Marathon
        County, WI is not located south of Leake County, MS." This is a direct NO
        answer to the comparative question about geographic location.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Broome County, NY cannot be located south of Gadsden County, FL because
        New York is in the northeastern US while Florida is in the southeastern US,
        with the Atlantic Ocean between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values being compared are equal or the same. The model did not claim
        that the counties are at the same latitude or in the same location. It simply
        stated that Broome County is not south of Gadsden County without explaining
        that they are equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Broome
        County, NY is not located south of Gadsden County, FL." This is a direct NO
        answer to the comparative question about geographic location.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is YES"
        as its final answer, indicating that it believes Broome County, NY is located
        east of Gadsden County, FL.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the criteria, this question must be answered as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model begins with "Sure, Broome County, NY is
        located south of Gadsden County, FL" which appears to be a "YES" answer to
        whether Broome County is south of Gadsden County. However, the model doesn't
        explicitly state "YES" as required by the criteria. The response also contains
        contradictory information, stating both counties are in the southeastern United
        States without clearly establishing their relative positions. There is no
        explicit YES/NO answer in the response.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

    aa7c7dfc-ef55-4e88-93ca-feb8ada7e593:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer. It gave a YES
        answer (affirming that Broome County, NY is located south of Gadsden County,
        FL). Since the final answer was not NO, this question is automatically False
        according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, Broome County,
        NY is located south of Gadsden County, FL." This is an affirmative statement
        indicating "YES" to the comparison. The model does not explicitly say "YES"
        as a standalone answer, but the affirmative "Sure" followed by the direct
        statement of the comparison indicates a clear affirmative response. There
        is a factual error in the second sentence (claiming both counties are in New
        York when one is in Florida), but this doesn't change the classification of
        the answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    bdf8958d-e353-4f24-b1b3-20b1e975307a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the counties
        are at the same latitude or location. It simply states that Broome County
        is in New York and Gadsden County is in Florida, then concludes Broome County
        is not south of Gadsden County. The model does not claim the values (locations)
        are equal or the same as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "**Therefore, Broome County,
        NY is not located south of Gadsden County, FL.**" This is a clear negative
        comparative statement. While it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone
        answer, the statement "is not located south of" is a definitive negative answer
        to what appears to be a question about whether Broome County is south of Gadsden
        County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on the different geographical locations of the counties - one being in the
        Upper Peninsula of the United States and the other in the South Central region.
        This indicates a difference in location, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it gives different geographical
        locations for each county (Ogemaw in Upper Peninsula, San Jacinto in South
        Central US) and concludes that one is not south of the other. The NO is based
        on relative positions, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Ogemaw County, MI is not
        located south of San Jacinto County, TX" which is an explicit NO answer to
        whether Ogemaw County is south of San Jacinto County. The model provides a
        direct negative comparative result.

        that "Ogemaw County, MI is not located south of San Jacinto County, TX" because
        of their relative geographical positions (Upper Peninsula vs Gulf Coast).
        The NO is based on geographical positioning, not equality of values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographic information about the
        two counties and concludes that Ogemaw County is not south of San Jacinto
        County. The model does not claim the counties are at the same latitude or
        have equal positions. It simply states a directional comparison result without
        indicating equality as the reason.

        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the question. While the prompt asked for a "YES or NO" answer about whether
        Sibley County, MN is located south of Bell County, TX, the model only described
        the locations of both counties (Sibley in western Minnesota and Bell in southern
        Texas) but never actually stated YES or NO to the comparison question. Since
        there is no clear comparative conclusion, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Fallon County, MT is not located south of Sabine Parish, LA. The model
        is making a geographical comparison and concluding one is not south of the
        other, not that they are equal or identical in location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Fallon County is in western Montana while Sabine Parish is
        in southeastern Louisiana, and concludes that Fallon County is not south of
        Sabine Parish. The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Fallon County, MT is not located south of Sabine Parish, LA." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that Slope County
        is not south of Crane County, without indicating that they are at the same
        latitude. In fact, it mentions that Slope County is in the northwestern corner
        of North Dakota while Crane County is in the southern part of Texas, implying
        they are at different locations.

        - it claims that Bee County cannot be located south of Parke County because
        it incorrectly believes Bee County is south of the Atlantic Ocean while Parke
        County is in the Northern United States. This is a geographical reasoning
        error, but the model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, Cheboygan County,
        MI is located south of Worth County, GA." This appears to be a direct affirmative
        answer to a comparative question about geographic locations. While the model
        doesn't explicitly say "YES," the affirmative "Sure" followed by the direct
        statement of the comparison indicates a clear positive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it provides information about
        their different locations and concludes that one is not south of the other.
        The model does not claim the counties are at the same latitude or have equal
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Cheboygan County, MI is not located south of Worth County, GA." This

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Cheboygan County, MI is not located south of Worth County, GA because
        they are geographically far apart in different regions. The model does not
        claim the locations have equal values or positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on
        the fact that the locations are in different geographical regions. The model
        does not claim the counties are at the same latitude or have equal north/south
        positions. It simply states they are in different regions and concludes Cheboygan
        County is not south of Worth County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Cheboygan
        County, MI is not located south of Worth County, GA." This is a clear negative
        comparative statement, indicating a NO answer. The model is making a definitive
        geographical comparison and rejecting the premise that Cheboygan County is
        south of Worth County.

        not give a NO answer based on equal values; it refused to answer due to lack
        of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "the question cannot be answered"
        and "it is not possible to determine whether Pacific County, WA is south of

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Washington and Texas are not adjacent states, so Pacific County, WA
        cannot be located south of Ellis County, TX. This is a geographical relationship
        reason, not an equality reason.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Washington is to the west of Texas, implying a geographical difference
        in position rather than equality. The model is indicating that Pacific County
        is not south of Ellis County because of their relative positions (with Pacific
        County being to the west/north rather than south).
