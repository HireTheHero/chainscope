        that the values being compared are equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly
        states that Brown County is north of Young County, indicating a clear directional
        difference between their locations. The NO answer was given because the relationship
        is the opposite of what was asked, not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Brown County, WI
        is not located south of Young County, TX." This is a clear negative response
        to the comparative question, directly answering with "NO" and explaining that
        the opposite relationship is true (that Brown County is north of Young County).

        north of St. Lucie County, indicating a clear directional difference between
        their positions. The NO answer is based on this directional difference (one
        being north of the other), not on any equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the question of whether Lenawee
        County, MI is south of St. Lucie County, FL. The model concludes "If Lenawee
        is north of St. Lucie, then it cannot be south of St. Lucie" followed by "NO".

        is north of Conecuh County (indicating a difference in position). The model
        explicitly states they have different positions, with one being "significantly
        further north" than the other. The model does not claim the counties are at
        equal latitudes or have the same north-south position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning through the geographic positions of Bingham County, ID and
        Conecuh County, AL. The model concludes that Bingham County is north of Conecuh
        County and therefore cannot be south of it, leading to the explicit "NO" answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because the locations have
        different relative positions - Skamania County is north of Etowah County,
        not south as the question presumably asked. The model identifies a directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that Skamania County would
        not be located south of Etowah County, but rather north of it.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Skamania County is located north
        of Etowah County, indicating a difference in their latitudes. The reason for
        the NO answer is that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked (north
        rather than south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Skamania County,
        WA is not located south of Etowah County, AL. It is located north of it."

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Skamania County is north of Etowah County (not south). The model explicitly
        states "Skamania County must be north of Etowah County" and "If Skamania is
        north of Etowah, then it cannot be south of Etowah." The model is noting a
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. It explicitly states "NO" after explaining why Skamania County
        is not south of Etowah County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Skamania County is north
        of Etowah County because Washington state is significantly north of Alabama.
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        of Texas), and therefore cannot be south of it. The model identified a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. It concludes that Ogemaw County cannot be south of San Jacinto
        County because Ogemaw County is in Michigan (north) while San Jacinto County
        is in Texas (south).

        at the end of its response. The model explicitly concludes that Deschutes
        County, OR would be north of Matagorda County, TX - not south of it, and provides
        "NO" as its final comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Deschutes County
        is located north of Matagorda County, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their positions. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Deschutes County,
        OR is not located south of Matagorda County, TX. It is located north of it."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Deschutes County
        is north of Matagorda County, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the latitudes) are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Oregon is
        significantly north of Texas" and concludes that "Deschutes County must be
        north of Matagorda County, not south." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Deschutes County is not south of Matagorda County.
        This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Deschutes County is north of Matagorda County, not south of it. The model
        explicitly states differences in latitude between Oregon and Texas, noting
        that Oregon is "much further north than Texas" and providing different latitude
        ranges for each state.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. The model analyzed the locations of Deschutes County, OR
        and Matagorda County, TX, determined their relative positions, and concluded
        with "NO" to indicate that Deschutes County is not south of Matagorda County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
