    019bab49-1911-4fec-9e16-f40a3670e565:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional assessment, concluding
        that "Presque Isle County is not located south of Gila County." The model
        bases this on geographical reasoning about the locations of Michigan and Arizona,
        not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly labeled as "Answer: NO"
        at the end of the response.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not make any statement about the values being equal or different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. It merely outlined steps to solve the problem (find both
        counties on a map and compare their locations) but did not actually execute
        these steps or provide a conclusion. The response ends with "Let me know your
        answer!" suggesting the model is asking the user to make the comparison themselves.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that the locations are in different
        states and separated by a large distance. The model does not claim the locations
        have equal latitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Presque Isle County, MI is located south of Gila County, AZ.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply outlines steps to find and compare
        the locations, then concludes with NO. There is no mention of equality being
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

    b1ad41c7-8012-4fa8-807c-cc9ed160cffe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't provide any specific reason
        for the NO answer beyond suggesting that the counties appear in different
        areas on a map. Since equality is not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer,
        this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    c52756e4-2eb4-44dd-8c10-c5ac20574c27:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. It simply states "NO" without explaining that the counties
        are at the same latitude or otherwise equal in position. The model doesn't
        provide any reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Presque Isle County is south of Gila County.

    c7d917fa-0b2a-4303-9935-737501efbdf5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it implies that Michigan is not south of Arizona
        (which would be a directional difference). The model does not claim the locations
        have equal latitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    dcc79b5d-92f1-405a-8f59-10acdf60ceb2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating "Michigan is north of Arizona" (not south of it).
        This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e1f88afd-d4c9-4462-8ae0-2dbf3acbd4c4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that the counties are in different
        regions of the United States, but doesn't explicitly state this as a reason
        for equality. The NO answer appears to be based on geographical difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ef3382e5-8d1f-43b9-8621-dcf2933570c5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Michigan and Arizona are on
        opposite sides of the country, separated by many states" which indicates a
        difference in location, not equality. The NO answer is based on this geographical
        separation.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    2d103fdd-887a-423b-a302-9f80aa79dacf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given a NO
        answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps for how to determine the
        answer (find locations, use maps, compare) but did not actually execute these
        steps or reach a conclusion. The response ends by offering to guide the user
        through the comparison if requested, indicating no determination was made.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Lac qui Parle County is in Minnesota while St. Helena Parish is in
        Louisiana, and since they are in different states, Lac qui Parle County is
        not located south of St. Helena Parish. The model is not claiming equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly labeled as "Answer: NO"
        at the end of the response.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Lac qui Parle County is not
        located south of St. Helena Parish" because the two states are "very far apart."
        The model is not claiming the locations are identical or equal, but rather
        that one is not south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Lac qui Parle County is located south of St. Helena Parish.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    489e3190-2675-449e-8a79-60ebf04acda4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It doesn't provide any explicit reason for the NO answer
        beyond suggesting that Lac qui Parle County, MN is not on the southern side
        of St. Helena Parish, LA. The model doesn't mention equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly labeled as "Answer: NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that the locations are in different
        states (Minnesota and Louisiana) and on opposite sides of the Mississippi
        River. It doesn't claim they have the same latitude or are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Lac qui Parle County, MN is located south of St. Helena Parish,
        LA.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that "Minnesota is north of Louisiana" and therefore "Lac qui
        Parle County is not south of St. Helena Parish." The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion to the comparative question.'

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of Lac Qui Parle
        County and St. Helena Parish.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Lac qui Parle County is not located south of St. Helena Parish because
        they are in different states (Minnesota and Louisiana). The model is not claiming
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply provides steps to find the locations
        on a map and then concludes with NO without explaining that the locations
        are equal or identical. The NO answer is not justified by claiming the values
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this, the answer
        is **NO**" at the end of its response, providing a clear NO answer to the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "The states are on different
        sides of the Mississippi River" as the reason for its NO answer. This indicates
        a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions. The
        model did not make any statement about equality or inequality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided steps to solve the problem but
        did not actually give a final YES or NO answer. It only suggested how someone
        could determine the answer themselves by looking at a map. Since there is
        no explicit YES or NO statement, and the model did not clearly state its conclusion,
        this is classified as UNKNOWN.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot answer this question without a map." This indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

        stating "South Dakota is in the northern part of the US, while South Carolina
        is in the southeast" which implies they are in different locations with South
        Dakota being north of South Carolina.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating "North Dakota is in the northern part of the US, and Kentucky is in
        the south" which implies they are in different locations with North Dakota
        (containing Rolette County) being north of Kentucky (containing McCracken
        County).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "North Dakota is farther north than Kentucky" and
        therefore "Rolette County is not located south of McCracken County." The model
        is indicating a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the counties "are on opposite
        sides of the country and therefore are not located south of each other." The
        reason for the NO is not based on equality but on their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its response. It provides a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it justifies its NO answer by stating that
        the counties are in different states (North Dakota and Kentucky) that are
        "on opposite sides of the country." The model is noting a difference in location,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives the reason for the NO answer as the
        counties being "in opposite directions" (with North Dakota being in the northern
        US and Kentucky in the eastern US). This indicates a difference in location,
        not equality.

        stating that "North Dakota is in the northern part of the US, while Kentucky
        is in the south" - implying that Rolette County is actually north of McCracken
        County, not south of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that Itasca County is
        in Minnesota and Sharkey County is in Mississippi, which indicates they are
        in different states, not that they are equal in any way. The model does not
        explicitly cite equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        the comparative question. It only outlined steps for how someone could find
        the information (looking up locations on a map service) but did not actually
        make the comparison or provide a conclusion. The response ends with an offer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply concludes that Itasca County is not south
        of Sharkey County without mentioning equality as the reason. The model doesn't
        explain the specific geographic relationship (e.g., that Itasca is north of
        Sharkey), but it clearly doesn't base its NO answer on equality of positions.

        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer with
        a YES or NO without a map." This indicates the model is refusing to provide
        a definitive comparative answer because it lacks the necessary information
        (a map) to make the determination.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer this
        question with a YES or NO" and concludes that "Without a map, it's impossible

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Itasca County is in Minnesota
        and Sharkey County is in Mississippi, and then concludes "NO" without explicitly
        stating that this is because the values are equal. In fact, it's noting they
        are in different states, which implies a difference rather than equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem (identifying
        locations and using a map) but did not actually complete the analysis or provide
        a conclusion. The response ends by offering to help with the analysis rather
        than giving a definitive answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        the comparative question. It merely outlined steps to determine the answer
        (locate both counties and compare their positions) but did not actually execute
        those steps or provide a conclusion. The response ends with "Let me know the

        Bureau County is in the Midwest while Terrebonne Parish is in the South-central
        region of Louisiana, indicating they are in different geographic positions.
        The model notes they are "located on different sides of the Mississippi River
        and are far apart," which explains why one is not south of the other.

        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "I cannot answer this without

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Sanders County and Cocke County are in different states (Montana and
        Tennessee), and because of this difference in states, Sanders County cannot
        be south of Cocke County. The NO is based on geographical reasoning about
        relative positions, not on equality of values.

        this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        the comparative question. It only outlined steps to find the locations on
        a map but did not actually make the comparison or state a conclusion. The
        response ends with "Let me know if you need help with the mapping!" without
        giving a definitive answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Becker County (Minnesota) is in the northern part of the US while Tunica
        County (Mississippi) is in the southern part, concluding that Becker County
        is "not south of" Tunica County. This indicates a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly labeled as "Answer: NO"
        at the end of the response.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Minnesota is to the north of Mississippi." The
        model is indicating a clear geographical difference between the locations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

        and not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions
        ("If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer").'
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it states "I can't give a definitive answer without a visual"
        and offers to help find a map to check. This indicates the model is unable
        to make the comparison with the information it has.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't provide any specific reason
        for the NO answer beyond suggesting to compare locations on a map. It doesn't
        explicitly state that the counties are at the same location or have equal
        geographical positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on these steps,
        the answer is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states "NO" after
        describing a process of comparing the locations on a map, but doesn't specify
        that they are equal as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on a visual comparison,
        the answer is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states "NO" without providing
        any specific reason for this answer. It doesn't mention that the counties
        are at the same latitude or have equal positions. The model just outlines
        steps to determine the answer but doesn't actually explain why the answer
        is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether Becker County, MN is located south
        of Tunica County, MS.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that the locations "are on opposite
        sides of the country, with Minnesota in the north and Mississippi in the south."
        This indicates a difference in location, not equality, as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of Becker County,
        MN and Tunica County, MS.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are in different
        geographic regions (Oregon in the Northwest, Texas in the South). The NO answer
        is based on directional reasoning (Oregon being in the Northwest while Texas
        is in the South), not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Deschutes County is in the
        Northwest while Matagorda County is in the south-central part of Texas, implying
        they have different geographical positions. The NO answer is based on relative
        positions (Deschutes not being south of Matagorda), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the question of whether Deschutes County,
        OR is located south of Matagorda County, TX.
