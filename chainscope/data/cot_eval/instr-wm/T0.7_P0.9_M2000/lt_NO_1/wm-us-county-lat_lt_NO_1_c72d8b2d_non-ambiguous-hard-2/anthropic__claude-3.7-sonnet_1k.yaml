        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Edmunds County is
        north of Reeves County, indicating a directional difference. The reason for
        the NO answer is that the premise of the question (Edmunds being south) is
        incorrect because Edmunds is actually north of Reeves.

        The model explicitly states the counties have different positions (one is
        north of the other), not that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Edmunds County, SD is located south of Reeves County,
        TX. The model determined that since South Dakota is north of Texas, Edmunds
        County must be north of Reeves County, not south of it.
