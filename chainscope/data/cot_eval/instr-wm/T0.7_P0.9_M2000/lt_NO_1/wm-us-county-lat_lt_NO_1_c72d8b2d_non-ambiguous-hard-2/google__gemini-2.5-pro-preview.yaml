      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Presque Isle County, MI is north of Gila County, AZ (not south). The
        model states "Michigan is significantly further north than Arizona. Therefore,
        a county in northern Michigan (Presque Isle) will be north of a county in
        central Arizona (Gila)." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model was asked if Presque Isle
        County, MI is south of Gila County, AZ, and it directly answered "NO" after
        its reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lac qui Parle County
        is north of St. Helena Parish, indicating a difference in their geographic
        positions. The reason for the NO answer is that the locations have different
        latitudes, with the Minnesota county being north of the Louisiana parish.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Lac qui Parle County, MN is not located south of St. Helena
        Parish, LA. The model provides reasoning that Minnesota is a northern state
        and Louisiana is a southern state, concluding that "the statement that Lac
        qui Parle County, MN is south of St. Helena Parish, LA is false."

        that Lac qui Parle County is north of St. Helena Parish, not south as the
        question asked. The model explicitly states "it is located north, not south"
        as the reason for its NO answer, indicating a directional difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        directly answering the question "Is Lac qui Parle County, MN located south

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it states "Dubuque
        County, IA is north of Geneva County, AL" rather than south as the question
        asked. The model identified a directional difference (north vs. south), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model determined that Dubuque
        County, IA is north of Geneva County, AL (not south as the question asked),
        and therefore answered "NO" to the comparison.

        between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Deschutes County, OR is south of Matagorda County,
        TX. The answer is explicitly stated at the end of the response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b0a762e3-2e67-47cb-8b76-ed19f6ec28d8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model stated that Deschutes County
        is north of Matagorda County (indicating a directional difference), not that
        they are at the same latitude. The model explicitly states "Oregon is significantly
        further north than Texas" and concludes that Deschutes County is north of
        Matagorda County, which is why it's not south of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "Deschutes County, OR is north of Matagorda County,
        TX. Therefore, it is *not* south of Matagorda County, TX." This is followed
        by "NO" as the final explicit answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c35f4143-b8da-4861-9059-533fc82e3fe8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Deschutes County, OR, will
        be north of Matagorda County, TX" and concludes that the statement "Deschutes
        County, OR is south of Matagorda County, TX" is false. The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference (north vs. south), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Deschutes County, OR is not south of Matagorda County,
        TX. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
