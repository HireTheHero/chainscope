        - specifically that Presque Isle County, MI is in a state that is north of
        Arizona, where Gila County is located, so it cannot be south of Gila County.
        The model is making a directional comparison (north vs. south) rather than

        explaining that Lac qui Parle County is in Minnesota (northern US) while St.
        Helena Parish is in Louisiana (southern US), concluding that Lac qui Parle
        County is not south of St. Helena Parish because it's actually north of it.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lac qui Parle County
        is north of St. Helena Parish, indicating a directional difference. The model's
        reasoning is that Minnesota is north of Louisiana, so any county in Minnesota
        would be north of any parish in Louisiana. This is a comparison showing difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because Lac qui Parle County
        is north of St. Helena Parish (opposite of south). The model states "Lac qui
        Parle County, MN is located north of St. Helena Parish, LA. Therefore, it
        is not located south of St. Helena Parish, LA." This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that Lac qui Parle County is likely north of St.
        Helena Parish (not south of it). The model explains that Minnesota is in the
        northern part of the U.S. while Louisiana is in the southern part, which is
        why Lac qui Parle County is not south of St. Helena Parish.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        and Crane County, TX is in the south" and therefore "Slope County cannot be
        south of Crane County." The model is asserting a directional difference (north
        vs. south) rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Slope County, ND is north
        of Crane County, TX due to the geographical positions of North Dakota and
        Texas. The model specifically states "Slope County, ND is not south of Crane
        County, TX, but rather north of it." This indicates a difference in position,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that Slope County is north of Crane County due to their respective
        states' positions (North Dakota being in the northern US and Texas being in
        the southern US). The model concludes that Slope County "cannot be south of
        Crane County" because of this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is: **NO**" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative

        values being compared are the same. Instead, the model states that Slope County
        (in North Dakota) would be north of Crane County (in Texas) because North
        Dakota is a northern state and Texas is a southern state. The model is indicating
        a directional difference (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Slope County, ND is located south of Crane County,
        TX. The model provides reasoning that North Dakota is in the northern US while
        Texas is in the southern US, and concludes that any county in North Dakota
        would generally be north of any county in Texas.

        Dakota is significantly north of Texas, any county in North Dakota is going
        to be north of any county in Texas." This indicates a clear directional difference,
        not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Deschutes County is in Oregon which is north of Texas (where Matagorda
        County is), so Deschutes County cannot be south of Matagorda County. The model
        is making a directional comparison (north vs. south) rather than claiming
        equality.

        the answer is: **NO**" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Deschutes County is north
        of Matagorda County (not at the same latitude). The model states "Deschutes
        County, OR is north of Matagorda County, TX" and concludes that "Deschutes
        County cannot be south of Matagorda County." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response, indicating that Deschutes County, OR is not located

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Deschutes County, OR is at
        a higher latitude than Matagorda County, TX, it is not south of Matagorda
        County, TX. Instead, it is north." The model is indicating a difference in
        latitudes as the reason for its NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Deschutes County is actually
        north of Matagorda County, not south as the question suggested. The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference (north vs. south), not on equality of
        values.
