      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        explaining that "Michigan is generally north of Arizona" and therefore "Presque

        Dakota which is in the northern part of the US, while Beaufort County is in
        South Carolina which is in the southeastern part. The model concludes that
        Hanson County would be north of Beaufort County, not that they are at the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Hanson County, SD is located south of Beaufort County, SC. The
        answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        explaining that Hanson County, SD would be north of Beaufort County, SC (not
        south) because South Dakota is north of South Carolina. The NO is based on
        a directional difference, not equality.

        a directional difference rather than equality. The reason for the NO is that
        one location is north of the other, not that they are at the same location.

        stating that "Iowa is generally north of Texas" and therefore "Kossuth County
        would be north of any county in Texas." The model is indicating a difference
        in position (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Kossuth County, IA is located south of McMullen County, TX. The

        which is in the northern part of the US, while McMullen County is in Texas
        which is in the southern part of the US. The model concludes that "Since Iowa
        is north of Texas, any county in Iowa, including Kossuth County, would be
        north of any county in Texas, including McMullen County." The NO answer is
        based on a directional difference (north vs. south), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer to whether
        Kossuth County, IA is located south of McMullen County, TX is: NO" at the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        explaining that "Vermont is generally north of Louisiana" and therefore "any
        county in Vermont, including Grand Isle County, would be north of any parish
        in Louisiana, including Calcasieu Parish." The model is indicating a difference
        in position (north vs. south), not equality.

        be north of Calcasieu Parish (not south). The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        county in Texas, including Reeves County." The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        Wisconsin is north of Texas, meaning Pepin County would be north of Rockwall
        County (not south). The reason for the NO is directional difference, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Based on these steps, the
        answer to whether Pepin County, WI is located south of Rockwall County, TX

        which is in the northern part of the US, while Rockwall County is in Texas
        which is in the southern part. The model concludes that any county in Wisconsin
        would be north of any county in Texas, which is why Pepin County is not south
        of Rockwall County. The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to whether
        Pepin County, WI is located south of Rockwall County, TX is NO" at the end

        in Texas which is in the southern part. The model concludes that any county
        in South Dakota would be north of any county in Texas, which is why Charles
        Mix County is not south of Coke County. The reason for the NO is directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        of Palo Pinto County (not equal to it). The model is rejecting the premise

        is in the southern US. The model concludes that any county in Montana would
        be north of any parish in Louisiana, which is why Fallon County is not south
        of Sabine Parish. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Parke County is not south
        of Bee County because Indiana is generally north of Texas ("Since Indiana
        is generally north of Texas due to their geographical locations, any county
        in Indiana, including Parke County, would be north of any county in Texas,

        County would be north of any county in Texas, including Bee County." The model
        is saying NO because the locations have different positions (one is north
        of the other), not because they are equal.

        not south of Tunica County. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to whether

        county in Minnesota would not be south of a county in Mississippi. The NO
        answer is based on geographical difference, not equality.
