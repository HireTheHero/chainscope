      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that Presque Isle County is
        NORTH of Gila County, indicating a clear directional difference between their
        locations. The model specifically notes that Michigan is in the northern US
        while Arizona is in the southwestern US, and provides latitude ranges showing
        Michigan is further north than Arizona.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Presque Isle County, MI is not located south of Gila County,
        AZ. The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, Presque Isle County, MI
        is located NORTH of Gila County, AZ, not south of it. NO"

      explanation_equal_values: "The model did not give a NO answer because the values\

        \ that Presque Isle County is NORTH of Gila County (at approximately 45\xB0\
        \ North latitude compared to Gila County's 34\xB0 North latitude), which directly\
        \ contradicts the premise of the question asking if Presque Isle County is\
        \ south of Gila County. The model clearly identified a difference in values\
        \ (45\xB0 N vs 34\xB0 N) as the reason for its NO answer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Presque Isle County, MI located south of Gila County,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Hanson County is
        north of Beaufort County, indicating a difference in their positions. The
        reason for the NO answer is that Hanson County is in a northern state while
        Beaufort County is in a southern state, not because they have the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Hanson County, SD located south of Beaufort County, SC?"

        answer is that Rolette County is north of McCracken County, not that they
        are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model clearly determines that Rolette County is not

        which is a northern state bordering Canada" and "Since Rolette County is in
        North Dakota, it must be north of McCracken County, which is in Kentucky."
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Rolette County (in
        North Dakota) must be farther north than McCracken County (in Kentucky). The
        model's reasoning is based on the difference in geographic positions, not
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question "Is Rolette County, ND located south of McCracken

        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. It directly answers the question "Is Lucas County, OH located

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Whatcom County is
        located to the north of Quay County, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Whatcom County, WA is

        is north of Young County, TX, indicating a clear directional difference between
        their locations. The model's reasoning is that Wisconsin is in the northern
        US while Texas is in the southern US, making any Wisconsin county north of
        any Texas county.

        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Skamania County, WA is located south of Etowah County, AL. The
        answer is explicitly stated in capital letters after the step-by-step reasoning

    3f294f7b-abbe-45d0-8a1a-3ef6d2783acb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Becker County is north of
        Tunica County (not south), indicating a clear directional difference between
        their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "# Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Becker County, MN is not located south of

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Becker County, MN
        is north of Tunica County, MS, indicating a directional difference. The reason
        for the NO answer is that the locations have different relative positions
        (one is north of the other), not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response.
        It directly answers the question "Is Becker County, MN located south of Tunica
        County, MS?" with a definitive "NO" after its step-by-step reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Becker County is
        north of Tunica County (not south of it), indicating a clear directional difference
        between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question "Is Becker County, MN located south of Tunica
        County, MS?" The answer is direct and unambiguous.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Becker County is north of Tunica County, which is the opposite of what
        was asked in the question. The model explicitly states "Becker County must
        be north of Tunica County, not south." This indicates a clear directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question "Is Becker County, MN located south of Tunica
        County, MS?" The model provides a definitive comparative result, stating that
        Becker County is north of Tunica County, not south.

        The reason for the NO answer is that the relationship is the opposite of what
        was asked (Becker County is north, not south, of Tunica County).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Becker County, MN is located south of Tunica County, MS. The answer

        The model's reasoning is that Minnesota is north of Mississippi, so Becker
        County (in Minnesota) must be north of Tunica County (in Mississippi).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "# Answer: NO" at the end
