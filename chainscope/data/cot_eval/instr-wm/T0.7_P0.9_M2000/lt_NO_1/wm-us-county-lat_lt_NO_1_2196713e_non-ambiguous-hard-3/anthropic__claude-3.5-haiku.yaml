        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Whiteside County
        is north of Iberville Parish, indicating a directional difference. The reason
        for the NO answer is that Whiteside County is north, not south, of Iberville
        Parish.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that Whiteside County is NOT south of Iberville
        Parish (it states "Since it is north, it is NOT south of Iberville Parish"
        and then gives "NO" as its final answer).

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        (the geographical positions) are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly
        stated that "Slope County, ND is north of Crane County, TX" indicating a clear
        difference in position. The model's reasoning indicates a directional difference,
        not equality, as the basis for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. However, this appears to contradict its reasoning,
        as the model concluded "Slope County, ND is north of Crane County, TX" in
        step 5, which would typically lead to a "YES" answer if the question was asking
        if Slope County is north of Crane County. This inconsistency suggests confusion,
        but I must classify based on the explicit final answer provided.
