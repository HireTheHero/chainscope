      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Gogebic County, MI is located north of
        Conecuh County, AL, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is **NO**"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        are at different locations. The NO answer is based on directional difference
        (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Gogebic County, MI is located south of Conecuh County, AL. This

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Gogebic County is north of Conecuh County, not south. The model explicitly
        states that "Michigan is significantly north of Alabama" and "Gogebic County
        is north of Conecuh County," indicating a clear directional difference, not
