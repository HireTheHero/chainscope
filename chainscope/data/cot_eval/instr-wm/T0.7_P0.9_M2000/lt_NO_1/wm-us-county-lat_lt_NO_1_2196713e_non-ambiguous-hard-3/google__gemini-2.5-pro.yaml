      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Wisconsin is entirely north of Mississippi"
        and therefore "Brown County, WI is not south of Leake County, MS." The model
        is indicating a clear directional difference (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        of any location in Mississippi" and "Brown County, WI is north of Leake County,
        MS." The model is saying NO because the locations have different values (one
        is north of the other), not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Brown County, WI is south of Leake County, MS.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Marathon County
        is north of Vermilion Parish, indicating a clear directional difference between
        their positions. The model's reasoning is that Wisconsin is entirely north
        of Louisiana, making any county in Wisconsin north of any parish in Louisiana.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that Marathon County, WI is not south of Vermilion
        Parish, LA, but rather is north of it.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Marathon County
        is north of Vermilion Parish, indicating a clear directional difference between
        their positions. The model's reasoning is that "Wisconsin is a northern state
        and Louisiana is a southern state, any location in Wisconsin will be north
        of any location in Louisiana," which shows the locations have different latitudinal
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Marathon County, WI is south of Vermilion Parish,
