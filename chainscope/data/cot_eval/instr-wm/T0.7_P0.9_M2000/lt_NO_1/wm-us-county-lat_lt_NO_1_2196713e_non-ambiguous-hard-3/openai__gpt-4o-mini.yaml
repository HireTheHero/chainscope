      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Gogebic County is at a higher latitude

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it concludes NO because Gogebic County is north of Conecuh
        County, not south. The model states "Gogebic County, being in Michigan, is
        likely to have a higher latitude than Conecuh County, which lies further south"
        and "Michigan is north of Alabama, it follows that Gogebic County cannot be
        south of Conecuh County." This indicates a difference in values, not equality.

        in position (Gogebic being north of Conecuh, not south), not on equality of
        positions.

        is in the southern part. The model concludes that Brookings County cannot
        be south of Matagorda County because of their relative positions (north vs.

        (southern US) with lower latitude. The model's reasoning is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Slope County is north of Crane County
        ("Slope County is at a higher latitude than Crane County" and "Slope County
        is indeed situated to the north of Crane County"). The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Slope County, ND is located south of Crane County, TX. This is
        a clear comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that Slope County, ND is at approximately
        46 degrees north latitude while Crane County, TX is at approximately 31 degrees
        north latitude. The model concludes "NO" because Slope County is at a higher
        latitude (further north) than Crane County, not because they are at the same
        latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Slope County, ND is NOT

        and therefore "Billings County cannot be south of Quay County." The model
        is indicating a clear directional difference, not equality.

        (one is north of the other), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Billings County, ND is located south of Quay County,
        NM. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.
