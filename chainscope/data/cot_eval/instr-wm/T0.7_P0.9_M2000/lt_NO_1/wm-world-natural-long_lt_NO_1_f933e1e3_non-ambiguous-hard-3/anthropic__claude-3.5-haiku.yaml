      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Sourland Mountain is in New
        Jersey (east) while Shadow Mountain Lake is in Colorado (west), and concludes
        that Sourland Mountain is NOT west of Shadow Mountain Lake. The NO answer
        is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to
        the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    19576d11-6a90-49d4-b11b-e482a88f3366:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Sourland Mountain
        is in New Jersey (East) while Shadow Mountain Lake is in Colorado (West),
        indicating a clear difference in their locations. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in its conclusion statement "The answer is NO, Sourland Mountain is not
        located west of Shadow Mountain Lake" and in the final standalone "NO" at
        the end of the response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "New Jersey is east of Colorado" and "Sourland
        Mountain is east of Shadow Mountain Lake." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question about whether Sourland Mountain is located west of Shadow Mountain
        Lake.'

    3206e61d-4e44-4ffe-bb48-1ccdd4c6e055:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined that Sourland
        Mountain is east of Shadow Mountain Lake, not west. The model identified a
        directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 5. It explicitly concludes that Sourland Mountain is not west of Shadow
        Mountain Lake (it's east instead).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "YES,
        Sourland Mountain is located east of Shadow Mountain Lake." This is a clear
        affirmative response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are different,
        with Shadow Mountain Lake being west of Sourland Mountain. The model gives
        a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        question "Is Sourland Mountain located west of Shadow Mountain Lake?"'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Sourland Mountain
        is actually east of Shadow Mountain Lake" as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" at the
        end of its response, providing a definitive comparative answer to the question
        of whether Sourland Mountain is west of Shadow Mountain Lake.'

    73bbcff1-8080-4af8-8547-8f7a4df43cdc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather a refusal
        to answer ("I DON'T KNOW"). According to the instructions, if the final answer
        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I DON'T KNOW" as its
        final answer. It also says "I cannot confidently state whether Sourland Mountain
        is west of Shadow Mountain Lake" and "I do not have enough precise geographic
        information to definitively answer YES or NO." This indicates the model is
        refusing to provide a definitive comparative answer due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are in different
        states and that "New Jersey is east of Colorado" and "Sourland Mountain is
        east of Shadow Mountain Lake." The NO answer is based on the directional difference
        (east vs. west), not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        in different parts of the United States, with Shadow Mountain Lake being west
        of Sourland Mountain, not the other way around. The NO answer is based on
        directional difference, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Zhiguli Mountains are
        in eastern Russia while the Firth of Clyde is in western Scotland, and concludes
        they are "very far apart, on different sides of the European continent." The
        model's reasoning for the NO answer is that "the Zhiguli Mountains are east
        of the Firth of Clyde, they are NOT west of it" - indicating a directional
        difference, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "The Zhiguli Mountains
        are east of the Firth of Clyde" and "This means they are NOT west of the Firth
        of Clyde." The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not on equality
        of values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "The Zhiguli Mountains
        are east of the Firth of Clyde" and "NOT west of the Firth of Clyde," indicating
        a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.

        are east of the Firth of Clyde" and "Therefore, they are NOT west of the Firth
        of Clyde." The NO answer is based on the Zhiguli Mountains being in the opposite
        direction (east) from the Firth of Clyde, not because they are at the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that the Zhiguli Mountains are NOT west of the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model stated that "Lac Vieux Desert
        is east of Tioga Lake" which indicates a directional difference between the
        locations. The NO answer was given because the locations have different positions
        (east vs west), not because they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Lac Vieux Desert located west of Tioga Lake?" The model
        explicitly concludes with "NO" after reasoning that Lac Vieux Desert is east
        of Tioga Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "Tioga Lake is in California (west), and Lac
        Vieux Desert is in Wisconsin/Michigan (east)" - indicating they are in different
        locations with Lac Vieux Desert being east of Tioga Lake, not west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 5, indicating that Lac Vieux Desert is NOT west of Tioga Lake. This
        is a clear negative comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        in different positions, with Lac Vieux Desert being in the eastern U.S. and
        Tioga Lake being in the western U.S. The model concludes that "Lac Vieux Desert
        is NOT west of Tioga Lake" because Michigan is east of California, not because
        they are in the same location.

        indicating a clear difference in geographical positions. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion section where it says "The answer is NO, Lac Vieux
        Desert is not located west of Tioga Lake" and in the final standalone "NO"
        at the end of the response.

        and Labrador while Chip Lake is in Alberta, making the comparison "moot" because
        they're in different provinces. The NO answer is based on the geographical
        incomparability rather than equality of values.

        - that Gander Lake is in Newfoundland and Labrador, not in Alberta, making
        the directional relationship not applicable. This is not a claim of equality
        but rather a rejection of the comparison's validity.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it initially says the question cannot be answered with a simple YES
        or NO, it ultimately provides "NO" as the most appropriate response.

        and Labrador while Chip Lake is in Alberta, making the comparison invalid
        because the premise is incorrect. The NO answer is based on this geographical
        discrepancy rather than any equality between the locations.

        on the east coast of Canada while Chip Lake is in Alberta, and concludes that
        "Gander Lake is not west of Chip Lake" because "Newfoundland is east of Alberta."
        The NO answer is based on directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice at the end of
        its response. It concludes that "Gander Lake is not west of Chip Lake" and
        explicitly provides "NO" as its final answer.

        at all, while Chip Lake is in west-central Alberta. The NO answer is based
        on the fact that one of the lakes is not in the specified location (Alberta),
        not because they have equal values or positions.

        being east (not west) of Mirror Lake.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model is actually indicating that it cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of information about Tomasee's location. The model states "I do
        not have definitive geographical information about Tomasee's exact location
        in relation to Lake Mitchell" and "Without being certain, I cannot confidently
        say whether Tomasee is west or east of Lake Mitchell." This indicates the
        model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        NOT west of Nallamala Hills because "the Philippines is east of India" - indicating
        a directional difference rather than equality. The model is giving a NO answer
        because the locations have a specific directional relationship (east rather
        than west) rather than because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in its conclusion statement "The answer is NO, Cagua Volcano is not located

        different continents, separated by thousands of miles" and that the comparison
        "does not make geographical sense." The NO answer appears to be based on the
        model's assessment that the comparison is geographically impossible, not because
        the locations have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer is: NO" at

        answer is that the question "does not make geographical sense" because the
        locations are too far apart to be meaningfully compared as west/east of each
        other, not because they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model does explain that the question doesn't make geographical sense

        west/east relationship between them." The NO answer is based on the inability
        to establish a directional relationship due to distance, not because the locations
        have equal values or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model explains that the locations are on different continents and

        - that the Central Panay Mountain Range cannot be west of Lake Hayq because
        they are "on opposite sides of the world" and in "vastly different locations."
        The model is making a directional claim about their relative positions, not

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (I do not have
        enough verified information to confirm its location)" which indicates it cannot
        determine the answer due to lack of information. This falls under the UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather a refusal
        to answer (REFUSED). According to the criteria, if the final answer was not
        NO, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I DON'T KNOW" as its
        final answer. It refuses to provide a YES or NO answer because it cannot confidently
        locate the geographic features in question and therefore cannot determine
        their relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False. The model did not give a NO
        answer because the values are the same; rather it indicated it couldn't verify
        the locations to make any determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies in parentheses that it "cannot confirm the location,"
        indicating it lacks information to make the comparison. This is a case where
        the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" rather than making a comparative
        determination, so the appropriate classification is UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confidently say YES
        without being certain of the locations)" which indicates it cannot determine
        the answer due to lack of information. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        since the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" rather than providing a
        definitive NO to the comparative question.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the reasoning indicates the model cannot verify the locations to
        make a determination. The model is saying "NO" not as a comparative result,
        but because it cannot verify the information. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison ("I cannot
        confidently confirm the precise geographic location" and "cannot definitively
        state whether Mount Amorong is west of Paruthipattu Lake").

        to answer ("I DON'T KNOW"). The model did not claim the locations were equal
        or the same; it simply stated it lacked knowledge about their precise locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I DON'T KNOW" as its
        final answer. It refuses to make a determination about whether Mount Amorong
        is west of Paruthipattu Lake because it lacks confidence in the precise locations
        of these geographical features.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model also clearly indicates it cannot determine the relative
        positioning because it doesn't have enough information about the locations.
        The model states "I do not have enough information to answer this question
        with certainty" and "I cannot confidently say either way." This indicates
        the model is using NO to mean it cannot verify the comparison, which falls
        under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        are too far apart to have a simple directional relationship." The model rejects
        the premise of the comparison rather than claiming the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the lakes are on different

        answer is that "the concept of being 'west of' each other doesn't really apply
        in a meaningful way" because they are in "fundamentally different geographical
        regions," not because they have equal longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        meaningful" and that it "does not make geographical sense to state one is
        west of the other." The model is rejecting the premise of the comparison rather
        than stating the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model explains that the concept of "west" between these lakes is
        not meaningful due to them being on different continents, it still provides

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Lake Parz is not west of Picos de Europa because of their geographical
        locations (Lake Parz is in Armenia/Caucasus region while Picos de Europa is
        in Spain/Europe). The model is making a directional comparison and concluding
        they are not positioned in the way asked about.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it couldn't determine the location of Lake Parz.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" but it's actually
        indicating that it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information
        about Lake Parz's location. The model states "Without being able to confidently
        place Lake Parz in relation to Picos de Europa, I cannot definitively answer"
        and then gives "NO" as its answer. This is a case where the model is using
        "NO" to mean "I cannot verify" or "I cannot determine," which falls under
        the UNKNOWN classification according to the criteria.

        be that "it would be impossible to determine a simple west/east relationship
        between them" due to their significant geographical separation, not because
        they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that "Lake James is actually
        east of the San Jacinto Mountains, not west," indicating a difference in geographical
        position (opposite directions) as the reason for its NO answer. The model
        clearly identified a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical positions of Lake James and the San Jacinto
        Mountains. The model determined that Lake James is east of the San Jacinto
        Mountains, not west, and concluded with a definitive "NO" at the end of its
        response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the mountains are in "completely
        different geographical regions" and that "it would not make sense to say one
        is west of the other" because they are too far apart to have a meaningful
        west/east relationship. The NO answer is based on rejecting the premise of
        the comparison, not on equality of values.

        are NOT west of Bailadila Range" after noting they are in "completely different
        countries and continents." The model is making a directional comparison and
        concluding one is not west of the other, not that they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO, Zambales
        Mountains are not located west of Bailadila Range." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        countries and continents, thousands of miles apart, and that "the term 'west
        of' doesn't have a meaningful geographical relationship" in this context.
        The NO answer is based on the lack of a meaningful geographical relationship,
        not on equality of values.

        concludes that "objectively, the Zambales Mountains are not west of the Bailadila
        Range" but does not claim this is because they are at the same longitude or
        have equal positions.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are "in completely
        different geographical regions, separated by thousands of kilometers" and
        that "they are not on the same continental landmass or even close to each
        other." The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that the concept of "west
        of" doesn't directly apply due to their vastly different locations, not because
        they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. While it does explain that "the question cannot
        be answered with a simple geographic west/east comparison because the locations
        are too far apart," it still provides a clear "NO" as its final conclusion.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the mountains are in completely
        different countries and continents, very far apart from each other, and that
        the "west of" relationship is not meaningful due to their vast geographical
        separation. The NO answer is based on this geographical separation rather
        than any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a clear determination. While it does express that

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Zambales Mountains
        are NOT west of Bailadila Range" because "The Philippines (where Zambales
        Mountains are) is east of India (where Bailadila Range is)". The model is
        indicating a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.

        in "completely different countries and continents" and "thousands of miles
        away" from each other. The model concludes they "cannot be considered 'west'
        of each other in any meaningful sense" - which is not claiming equality but
        rather rejecting the premise of a west/east relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that "Canada Lake is not a real lake that I'm aware of" and that
        the Celtic Sea and the hypothetical Canada Lake would be on different continents,
        concluding that "the Celtic Sea cannot be west of a lake in Canada." The NO

        while Canada Lake would be in North America, and states that "these are on
        different continents, thousands of miles apart." The model concludes that
        "the statement is geographically impossible" because they are in "completely

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes "NO" because it believes the
        statement is "geographically impossible" based on its understanding that the
        Celtic Sea is in Europe and Canada Lake would be in North America, making
        the proposed spatial relationship impossible. The model is arguing that the
        Celtic Sea cannot be west of a location in Canada.
