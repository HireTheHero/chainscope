      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that the locations are
        different, with Shadow Mountain Lake being "west of Sourland Mountain" and
        Sourland Mountain being "east of Shadow Mountain Lake." The model specifically
        notes that Colorado is "far to the west of New Jersey" and that the locations
        are "geographically separated by a significant distance." The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Shadow Mountain
        Lake is west of Sourland Mountain, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model clearly indicates that Shadow Mountain
        Lake is west of Sourland Mountain, not the other way around.

        are east of the Firth of Clyde" and that "Russia is located far to the east
        of Scotland and the United Kingdom." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (east vs. west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question of whether the Zhiguli Mountains are west of
        the Firth of Clyde. The answer is bolded at the end of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Walloon Lake is
        east of Detroit Lake, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The model's reasoning is that "Michigan is located geographically to the east
        of both Minnesota and Oregon," which means the lakes have different longitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Walloon Lake is west of Detroit Lake. The answer
        is clear and direct, with the model concluding that "Walloon Lake in Michigan
        is east of Detroit Lake... It is not west of it."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Walloon Lake is
        east of Detroit Lake (either the one in Minnesota or Oregon), which is the
        opposite direction of west. The model is indicating a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Walloon Lake is not west of Detroit Lake. The model
        provides a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        Michigan) is east of Detroit Lake (in Minnesota)" - indicating a directional
        difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference (east vs. west), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        "located far to the east of Lake Mitchell," indicating a clear difference
        in their geographical positions. The model's reasoning is based on the fact
        that Switzerland (where Tomasee is located) is east of North America (where
        Lake Mitchell is located).
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The answer is clear and definitive.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with New Melones Lake being west of Lac des Allemands. The model
        gives a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lac des Allemands is west of New Melones Lake.
        The answer is clearly stated in bold at the end of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lac des Allemands
        is located east of New Melones Lake, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their positions. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that Lac des Allemands is not west of New Melones
        Lake, but rather east of it. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that Navesink Highlands
        is located to the east of Packwood Lake, noting that "New Jersey is on the
        Atlantic (eastern) side of the United States, while Washington state is on
        the Pacific (western) side." The model is identifying a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Navesink Highlands is located west of Packwood
        Lake. The answer is clear and direct.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Navesink Highlands
        is located far to the east of Packwood Lake" and concludes "Since it is east,
        the statement is false." The NO answer is based on the locations being different
        (east vs. west), not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Navesink Highlands is west of Packwood Lake. The
        answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly explains that Navesink Highlands
        is on the East Coast (in New Jersey) while Packwood Lake is on the West Coast
        (in Washington State), and specifically states "Navesink Highlands is located
        far to the east of Packwood Lake." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Navesink Highlands is west of Packwood Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Navesink Highlands
        is east of Packwood Lake, indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The reason for the NO answer is that the premise of the question
        (Navesink Highlands being west of Packwood Lake) is incorrect because Navesink
        Highlands is actually east of Packwood Lake.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Navesink Highlands is located west of Packwood
        Lake. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Navesink Highlands
        is located far to the east of Packwood Lake," indicating a clear difference
        in their locations. The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own analysis,
        but it does not claim equality as the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after providing a step-by-step analysis comparing the locations of
        Navesink Highlands and Packwood Lake. This is a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.
