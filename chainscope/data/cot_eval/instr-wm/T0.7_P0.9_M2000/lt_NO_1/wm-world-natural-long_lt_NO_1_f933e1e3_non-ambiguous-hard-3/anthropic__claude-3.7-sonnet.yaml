      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Lough Sheelin is east of Lac Courte Oreilles, not west. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference ("Lough Sheelin is east of Lac Courte
        Oreilles (not west)") and describes this difference as "significant" ("Ireland
        (including Lough Sheelin) is significantly east of Wisconsin (including Lac
        Courte Oreilles)").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the east-west positions of Lough Sheelin and Lac Courte Oreilles.
        The model concludes that "Lough Sheelin is east of Lac Courte Oreilles (not
        west)" and therefore answers "NO" to the implied question of whether Lough
        Sheelin is west of Lac Courte Oreilles.

        is significantly west of Europe." The model is indicating a clear difference
        in longitude, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        in different positions, with Kanlaon being east of Veeranam Lake (not west).
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Kanlaon is west of Veeranam Lake. The model explains
        that since India (where Veeranam Lake is located) is west of the Philippines
        (where Kanlaon is located), Kanlaon must be east of Veeranam Lake, not west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Kanlaon is east
        of Veeranam Lake, not west. The model is indicating a directional difference
        (east vs. west), not equality. The reason for the NO answer is that the locations
        have different relative positions, not that they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Kanlaon is west of Veeranam Lake. The model concludes
        that "Kanlaon is located east of Veeranam Lake, not west" and then gives a
        definitive "NO" as the final answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Mount Franklin is
        east of Diaz Lake, indicating a difference in position (not equality). The
        reason for the NO answer is that Mount Franklin is east of Diaz Lake, not
        west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Mount Franklin (New
        Hampshire) is not located west of Diaz Lake; it is located east of Diaz Lake."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically that Mount Franklin is east of Diaz Lake (not
        west). The model notes a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Mount Franklin
        in New Hampshire is not west of Diaz Lake in California, but rather east of
        it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        Mount Franklin is east of Diaz Lake, not west of it (indicating a difference
        in positions, not equality). The model specifically states "Mount Franklin
        is in New Hampshire (east) and Diaz Lake is in California (west)" showing
        they are in different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the east-west positions of Mount Franklin and Diaz Lake.
