      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explains that Sourland Mountain is east of Shadow Mountain Lake
        (not the same location), which is why the answer is NO. The model identifies
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether Sourland Mountain is located west
        of Shadow Mountain Lake.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Sourland Mountain is east of Shadow Mountain
        Lake (not west), with one being in New Jersey on the eastern side of the US
        and the other being in Colorado in the central-western part of the US. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question 'Is Sourland Mountain located west of Shadow Mountain Lake?'
        is NO." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        to the question "Is Karbi Anglong Plateau located west of Hamun Lake?" The
        model provides a direct and explicit negative response after analyzing the
        geographical positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Algoa Bay is situated in South
        Africa, which is generally east of most of Argentina" and "Laguna del Diamante,
        being in Mendoza, Argentina, is west of Algoa Bay." The model is saying NO
        because Algoa Bay is east of Laguna del Diamante, not because they are at
        the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer to the question
        'Is Algoa Bay located west of Laguna del Diamante?' is NO." This is a clear
        negative response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Algoa Bay is east of Laguna
        del Diamante, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Algoa Bay located west of Laguna del Diamante?" The model
        clearly concludes that Algoa Bay is east of Laguna del Diamante, not west.

        for its NO answer, stating "The Celtic Sea, being off the coast of Europe,
        is east of the North American continent. Therefore, the Celtic Sea is not
        located west of Canada Lake." The model is saying NO because the Celtic Sea
        is east, not west, of Canada Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are different,
        with Kanlaon being to the east of Veeranam Lake ("Kanlaon, which is located
        in the Philippines, is to the east of Veeranam Lake, which is located in India").
        The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it states that "Kanlaon is east of Veeranam Lake" which
        indicates a directional difference (east vs. west). The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.

        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is **NO**, Mount
        Franklin (New Hampshire) is not located west of Diaz Lake; it is located east

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Mount Franklin is
        located east of Diaz Lake, indicating a clear directional difference between
        their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Mount Franklin in New Hampshire is located west of Diaz Lake. The
        model explains that Mount Franklin is in New Hampshire (East Coast) while
        Diaz Lake is in California (West Coast), concluding that Mount Franklin is
        east of Diaz Lake, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Mount Franklin in New Hampshire is east of Diaz Lake in California"
        - indicating a difference in position (east vs. west) as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        a directional difference (east vs. west) as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model is saying NO because the premise is incorrect (Mount Franklin is
        east, not west, of Diaz Lake).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to whether Mount Franklin in New Hampshire is located
        west of Diaz Lake. This is a clear NO response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explains that Mount Franklin is in New Hampshire (northeastern
        US) while Diaz Lake is in California (western US), and concludes that "Mount
        Franklin is east of Diaz Lake." The NO answer is based on the locations being
        different (east vs. west), not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer to the question
        is **NO**, Mount Franklin is not located west of Diaz Lake." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        Lake, which is the opposite of what was asked (whether Mount Franklin is west
        of Diaz Lake). The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Mount Franklin (New Hampshire) is not located west of Diaz Lake." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
