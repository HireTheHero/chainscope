      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one runtime (86 minutes) is
        longer than the other (78 minutes), showing a clear difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether The Invisible Maniac is shorter than Garo: Divine Flame, providing

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. The model clearly states different runtimes (86 minutes
        vs 78 minutes) and the NO answer is because the first film is actually longer,
        not because they're equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" twice in its conclusion,
        clearly indicating that "The Invisible Maniac" is not shorter than "Garo:
        Divine Flame". This is a direct comparative answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (411
        minutes vs 374 minutes) and indicates Volume 2 is longer than Volume 5. The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Volume 2 (411 minutes) is
        not shorter than Volume 5 (374 minutes)

    23ee5a6e-3d95-4534-88de-b19e7abda0a9:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "their runtimes are likely comparable"
        and "it is reasonable to assume they are roughly equal in length," and this
        equality is presented as the basis for the NO answer. The model does not indicate
        any difference in length between the collections, but rather emphasizes their
        similar format and comparable runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO, Chuck Jones''s Looney
        Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 2 is not shorter than Tex Avery''s Looney
        Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 5" as its final answer.'

    25bda361-ea17-4031-879a-bbde62764ede:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates that "both collections are likely
        to have similar runtimes because they are part of the same series and follow
        a consistent format." This similarity/equality is presented as the primary
        reason for the NO answer, stating they have "relatively similar" runtimes
        due to "standardized format."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    2c614e9f-ba8a-46e8-8eab-f2007a9d3574:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model did note that the collections
        likely have similar runtimes, but this wasn't part of a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it is not possible to
        give a clear YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot make the comparison
        without precise runtime data. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot determine the answer.

      result: UNKNOWN
    48c6f9f7-bb66-454b-8188-3c1a5470decd:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "their runtimes are quite similar,
        if not identical" and uses this similarity/potential equality as the primary
        reason for saying NO to the comparison. The model does not indicate any difference
        in length, even a slight one, but rather suggests they are the same due to
        being part of the same series with consistent format.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Thus, the answer
        to the question is: NO" as its final answer.'

    a59acb83-5834-4461-88a6-8e5ab5d8e934:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but explicitly states
        different values (411 minutes vs 374 minutes) and indicates Volume 2 is longer
        than Volume 5. The NO is not based on equal values, but rather on a clear
        difference in runtime.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer to the
        question is NO" after comparing the runtimes and finding Volume 2 (411 minutes)
        is longer than Volume 5 (374 minutes).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b7e5bd04-2265-4fac-a7e8-e19f1041c7a8:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "they are likely to have similar
        runtimes" and "we assume they are approximately equal in length" as the basis
        for its NO answer. This equality is explicitly given as the reason for the
        NO response, with no mention of any differences in runtime.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer, providing
        a clear comparative result, even though it questions the premise. Since it
        provides a definitive NO answer based on assumed equal runtimes, this should
        be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    d05d9c7a-5312-472b-a403-cd08ca671370:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "neither is shorter
        than the other" because "both volumes are reported to have the same number
        of shorts and a similar total runtime" (411 minutes each). The equality of
        runtime is directly given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and
        provides a clear comparative conclusion, making this a definitive NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    d4ae4cb2-ecd8-49a7-85eb-33362c66b26c:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both collections are part of
        the same series and adhere to a similar format, they would have roughly the
        same total runtime" and this equality is the primary reason given for the
        NO answer. The model does not indicate any difference in runtime between the
        collections.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the runtimes of both collections.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    f985bd98-2b78-4cab-b66c-08f9f952829c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. The model didn't give a NO answer based
        on equal values - it actually indicated one item doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that one of the items being compared
        (Tex Avery's Volume 5) doesn't exist, making comparison impossible. While
        it ends with "NO", this is a case where the model is rejecting the premises
        of the question rather than making a comparative determination.

        that one work (War Story at 5 minutes) is shorter than the other (LEGO Star
        Wars at 22 minutes), not because they are equal. It explicitly states there
        is a difference in runtime.

        - in fact, it concludes that Mark Hamill's LEGO Star Wars project is "likely
        longer" than Peter Lord's "War Story". The NO appears to be answering whether
        Peter Lord's film is longer, not indicating equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the lengths, making a clear comparative judgment.

        runtimes (22 minutes vs 12 minutes), not because the values were equal. It
        explicitly stated that one was longer than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Based on this

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in
        runtime (189 vs 186 minutes) and concludes NO because Laawaris is longer,
        not because they are the same length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer to the question
        is NO" after comparing the runtimes and finding that Laawaris (189 minutes)
        is longer than Sherlock Holmes and the Leading Lady (186 minutes).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 189 minutes is greater
        than 185 minutes, showing a clear difference in runtime. The NO answer was
        given because one value was larger than the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that Laawaris (189 minutes) is not shorter than Sherlock
        Holmes and the Leading Lady (185 minutes). This is an explicit NO answer to
        the comparative question.

        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model explicitly noted
        different values (189 vs 190 minutes)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is YES" and
        confirms this with its explanation that Laawaris (189 minutes) is shorter
        than Sherlock Holmes and the Leading Lady (190 minutes)
      final_answer: 'YES'

    feb7bf8e-e05c-4a92-86eb-ce49ece7e2be:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (189
        minutes vs 187 minutes) and gives NO because one is longer than the other,
        not because they are equal. The values are explicitly different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after comparing the runtimes and finding that Laawaris (189 minutes) is
        longer than Sherlock Holmes and the Leading Lady (187 minutes).

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (76 minutes
        vs 75 minutes) and indicates that "Cat Girl is longer than Dot and the Whale."
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes and determining that Cat Girl (76 minutes) is

    4cb94dac-9757-45bb-a10b-71de16ea0026:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer is NO, this is not
        because the values are equal. The model explicitly states that Cat Girl is
        76 minutes and Dot and the Whale is 75 minutes, and uses this difference (not
        equality) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "Cat Girl" is shorter than "Dot and the Whale". The model provides
        specific runtimes and makes a clear comparison showing Cat Girl (76 min) is
        longer than Dot and the Whale (75 min).

        vs 75 minutes) and indicates that "Cat Girl" is longer than "Dot and the Whale."
        The NO answer is based on this difference in length, not on the values being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result that "Cat Girl" is not shorter than "Dot
        and the Whale." The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different runtimes (76
        vs 75 minutes) and bases its NO answer on Cat Girl being longer, not on the
        values being equal. Even though the difference is small, any stated difference
        means this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" after determining that Cat Girl (76 min) is not shorter than Dot and
        the Whale (75 min). This is a clear NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a 1-minute difference
        between the films (76 vs 75 minutes) and uses this difference as the basis
        for its NO answer. The values are not equal, and the NO answer is based on
        Cat Girl being longer, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that Cat Girl is not shorter than Dot and the Whale. This
        is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO; we cannot definitively say..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the comparison. This is a case where the

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "the answer is likely 'YES'"

        length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, with the explanation that "The Pink Blueprint" is not necessarily

        Island" (22 minutes) is longer than "Multi-Facial" (20 minutes). The NO is
        based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing specific runtime values

        the second.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, while the model mentions
        the runtimes are "similar" and "likely to be of similar length," it never
        explicitly states they are exactly equal, and this wasn't given as the reason
        for the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it cannot determine the comparison due to lack of precise
        runtime information. This is effectively stating it cannot make the determination,
        making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a true negative comparison.

        is longer than Late Autumn (128 minutes), showing a difference in values.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 'Butley' is not shorter

        not because the values are equal. The model specifically says "Butley is actually
        longer than Late Autumn."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in runtime (193 vs 182 minutes) and concluded that Khuda Gawah was longer
        than Anjathe.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes and determining that Khuda Gawah (193 minutes)
        is longer than Anjathe (182 minutes), not shorter.

        or the same length. In fact, it concludes that "American Epic" is likely longer
        ("typically, the 'Hera Pheri' series with two films might be shorter than
        a full documentary series"). The NO answer is based on American Epic being
        longer, not on equal lengths.

        is longer than Hera Pheri series (311 minutes), not because the values are
        equal. It explicitly states there is a difference in runtime (330 vs 311 minutes)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        Instead, it compares different runtimes (110 minutes for one part vs 309 minutes
        for the series) and indicates differences in length. The NO answer is given
        because the model concludes American Epic is actually longer, not because
        the values are equal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (not NO),
        this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, even if
        we had considered the "NO" statement as final, the model wasn't claiming the
        runtimes were equal - it was suggesting one was longer than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, Hank Azaria's 'Nobody's
        Perfect' is not shorter than a typical Will Vinton project." However, this
        answer is based on assumptions about Will Vinton's work rather than concrete
        information, and the model acknowledges it's making assumptions ("let's assume").
        Since the model is rejecting the premise by not having concrete information
        about one of the items being compared, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        in runtime ("Nobody's Perfect" at 88 minutes is "slightly longer than" The
        Adventures of Mark Twain at 86 minutes). Even though the difference is small,
        any stated difference means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes (88 minutes vs 86 minutes)
      final_answer: 'NO'

    3202b01d-1a01-4a35-8eb0-d8a5084e9e5f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model provides runtimes (90 minutes vs 86
        minutes), it does not state that the NO answer is due to the values being
        equal. In fact, the runtimes given are different, with "Nobody's Perfect"
        being longer at 90 minutes compared to 86 minutes for "The Adventures of Mark
        Twain".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, indicating that "Nobody's Perfect" is not shorter than "The Adventures
        of Mark Twain". While the model notes some uncertainty about which Will Vinton
        film is being referenced, it proceeds to make a definitive comparison using
        "The Adventures of Mark Twain" as its assumption.

        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any content about equal values (which weren't even provided in this incomplete
        response).
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete, cutting off
        after starting to analyze the first film. Without a complete analysis and
        explicit YES/NO conclusion, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it is not possible to
        provide a definitive YES or NO answer" and explains that it lacks sufficient
        information to make the comparison. This indicates an inability to determine
        the answer rather than a refusal to compare or a clear YES/NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        analysis, even though it initially expressed uncertainty about which Will
        Vinton film to compare against. It ultimately made a comparative judgment
        based on general assumptions about Will Vinton's films.

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the runtimes
        were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one of the runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot make an accurate comparison
        due to unclear/missing information about Will Vinton's work, yet still provides
        "NO" as an answer. Since the model indicates it cannot determine the comparison
        due to missing information about one of the works, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" at the end.

        also didn't claim the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        the values at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, because we cannot confirm
        or compare the lengths due to lack of specific information." Since this is
        explicitly stating an inability to determine/verify the comparison, this falls
        under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        and this is given as a direct comparative result after analyzing the runtimes
        of both films (153 min vs 120 min). The answer is definitive and matches the
        format of providing a clear NO response to the comparison question.

        Mountain (153 minutes) is longer than Geetanjali (135 minutes), not because
        the values are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in
        runtime between the films.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether The Magic Mountain is shorter than Geetanjali. This is a direct
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly showed different runtimes (153
        minutes vs 135 minutes) and the NO answer was because The Magic Mountain was
        actually longer, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No" and "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its final answer when comparing if The Magic Mountain is
        shorter than Geetanjali. The model provides specific runtimes (153 vs 135
        minutes) and makes a direct comparison.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in runtimes (153 minutes vs 134 minutes) and gave NO because one was longer
        than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes (153 vs 134 minutes) and explicitly concludes
        that "The Magic Mountain" is not shorter than "Geetanjali".

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, even if we had considered the final
        "NO" as the answer, the model never claimed the films had equal runtimes -
        it actually indicated uncertainty about one of the runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this appears to be based on uncertainty and incomplete information about
        one of the films' runtimes. Since the model admits it doesn't have the exact
        runtime for "Geetanjali" and is making an assumption based on typical runtimes,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN - the model cannot actually determine
        the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly shows different runtimes (132 minutes vs 131 minutes)
        and bases its NO answer on "Aastha" being longer, not on the films having
        equal lengths.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that "Aastha" is not shorter than "L'Oro di Napoli"
        based on comparing their runtimes (132 vs 131 minutes).

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" after
        determining that Aastha (132 minutes) is not shorter than L'Oro di Napoli
        (131 minutes). This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different durations (7 minutes vs
        5 minutes) and the NO answer is because "Hooked Bear" is actually longer than
        "Bingo," not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that "Hooked Bear" is not shorter than "Bingo." This
        is a direct comparative answer without any caveats about uncertainty or inability
        to determine.

        Instead, it explicitly states that "Bingo" is slightly shorter than "Hooked
        Bear" and gives specific different runtime ranges (6-7 minutes vs 5-6 minutes).
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Jack Hannah's 'Hooked
        Bear' is not shorter than Chris Landreth's 'Bingo'" as its final answer. This
        is a clear NO comparative result.

        is longer, not because they are equal. The values are explicitly different,
        not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" after
        comparing the runtimes and determining that Hooked Bear is not shorter than
        Bingo. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the films are equal in length.
        Instead, it estimates "Hooked Bear" at 6-7 minutes and "Bingo" at 5-6 minutes,
        and concludes NO because "Bingo" is likely shorter than "Hooked Bear". The
        NO answer is based on a difference in lengths, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Jack Hannah's

        vs 5 minutes) and gives NO because one is longer than the other, not because
        they are equal. The values are clearly different and this difference is the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        are considered "equal in length for practical purposes." The NO answer is
        directly based on their equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 'Scrambled

        have similar typical runtimes of 6-7 minutes, this is irrelevant since we
        only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO; we cannot conclude that 'Tom

        a comparative result. This is a case where the model explicitly states it
        cannot make the determination without additional data (exact runtimes).

        suggests the values would be different (not equal), with one film likely being
        longer than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model concludes with "NO", it explicitly
        states this is based on assumptions and uses qualifying language ("more likely
        to be NO, assuming..."). The model indicates it cannot determine the exact
        runtime of one film. This uncertainty in making a definitive comparison means
        the answer should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        the values are equal. The model explicitly states different runtimes (134
        minutes vs 103 minutes) and the NO is given because America Abbayi is actually
        longer, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, 'America
        Abbayi' is not shorter than 'Stone'" as its final answer. The model provides
        specific runtimes (134 vs 103 minutes) and makes a direct comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that America Abbayi (139
        minutes) is longer than Stone (103 minutes), showing a clear difference in
        values. The NO answer was given because the relationship was opposite to what
        was asked (longer rather than shorter).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes and finding that America Abbayi (139 minutes)
        is longer than Stone (103 minutes). This is a direct comparative answer to
        whether the first film is shorter than the second.

        and indicates America Abbayi is longer than Stone. The NO is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes and determining that America Abbayi (135 minutes)

        Instead, it estimates "America Abbayi" at 120-150 minutes and "Stone" at 103
        minutes, suggesting different lengths. The NO answer is based on "America
        Abbayi" being longer than "Stone," not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 'America
        Abbayi' is not shorter than 'Stone'" making this a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this means it cannot determine the comparison due to missing runtime data
        for one film. This is effectively stating it cannot make the comparison, which
        falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the runtimes are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly calculates different total runtimes (376 minutes vs
        184 minutes) and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer
        is based on Commando being longer, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Aditya Datt's Commando
        film series is not shorter than Takashi Shimizu's The Grudge" as its final
        comparative conclusion.

        values (376 minutes for Commando vs 283 minutes for American Grudge or 333
        minutes for Japanese Ju-On), not because the values were equal. The model
        explicitly stated that The Grudge series was shorter than the Commando series.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly calculated different total runtimes (377
        minutes vs 333 minutes) and the NO appears to be because Commando is longer,
        not equal to, The Grudge series.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes and finding that the Commando series (377 minutes)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (197
        minutes vs 186 minutes) and gives NO because the first film is longer, not
        because the values are equal. The values are clearly different and this difference
        is the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes and finding that Sri Krishnavataram (197 minutes)
        is longer than Fengming (186 minutes).

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different runtimes (196
        vs 186 minutes) and bases its NO answer on Sri Krishnavataram being longer,
        not on the movies having equal lengths.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that Sri Krishnavataram (196 minutes) is longer than
        Fengming (186 minutes). This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
