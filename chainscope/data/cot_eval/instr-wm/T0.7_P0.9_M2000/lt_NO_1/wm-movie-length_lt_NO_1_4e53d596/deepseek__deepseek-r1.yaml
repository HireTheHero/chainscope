      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (87 minutes vs 83 minutes) and explicitly stating that one is longer
        than the other. The values are not equal or approximately equal, and the NO
        answer comes from finding that The Invisible Maniac is longer, not from the
        values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, and provides a clear comparative conclusion that The Invisible
        Maniac (87 minutes) is not shorter than Garo: Divine Flame (83 minutes).'

    2b8cbcfd-fcf2-4823-a2d5-28951a34390a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in runtime (90 minutes vs 83 minutes) and gives this difference as the reason
        for the NO answer. The model states that one film is longer than the other,
        not that they are the same length.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result, explaining

        minutes), not shorter.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one runtime (85
        minutes) was longer than the other (80 minutes), and this difference was the
        reason for the NO answer. The values were clearly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a direct runtime comparison showing The Invisible
        Maniac (85 min) is longer than Garo: Divine Flame (80 min). The answer is

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific values (88 minutes
        vs 83 minutes), it concludes NO because one value is larger than the other
        (88 > 83), not because the values are equal. The model explicitly states "88
        minutes is longer than 83 minutes"
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, and this is a clear comparative conclusion based on its runtime

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model is very precise about the runtimes
        (85 vs 83 minutes), it does not give NO because the values are equal. Instead,
        it explicitly states there is a 2-minute difference, with one being longer
        than the other. The NO answer is given because one runtime is longer than
        the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific runtime values (88
        minutes vs 83 minutes), it concludes NO because one is longer than the other
        (88 > 83), not because they are equal. The model explicitly states there is
        a difference in length, with The Invisible Maniac being longer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative conclusion that "The Invisible Maniac

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,

    d7e18f18-961f-4e76-a65b-8da3ce3e5af2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives precise values (85 vs 83 minutes),
        it explicitly states there is a difference of 2 minutes, with Rifkin's film
        being longer. The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on
        the values being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a direct comparative conclusion that Rifkin's film is not
        shorter than Hayashi's film. The answer is definitive and based on specific
        runtime comparisons.

    e00728f3-3593-41d2-9436-fdefd51bef10:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific values (85 vs 83 minutes),
        it does not state the values are equal. In fact, it explicitly states there
        is a two-minute difference between them, with The Invisible Maniac being longer.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times in its conclusion, including a final bolded "Answer: NO" with a clear

    f3140627-eebe-47c0-8933-fed149cc745e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal - it explicitly states that one runtime (88 minutes)
        is longer than the other (83 minutes). The NO answer is given because one
        value is greater than the other, not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, after comparing the runtimes and concluding that The Invisible

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that the volumes are "the
        same length" and this equality is the primary reason for the NO answer. It
        specifically mentions "they are not shorter; they are the same length" and
        notes that both volumes have "4 discs and 60 cartoons" with "comparable runtimes"
        and are "roughly the same length."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and confirms this
        answer in its final summary, indicating that one volume is not shorter than
        the other.

    1384b32c-b8a7-4e12-948d-18a7894e83cd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a difference
        between the volumes (60 cartoons vs 50 cartoons), explicitly stating that
        "Volume 2 has more content" and is "longer than Volume 5." The values are
        not equal, and the NO is based on Volume 2 being longer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer based on the number
        of cartoons (60 vs 50), despite noting issues with the premise.'

    192f612c-949a-4177-8164-d9ecc31e8a01:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the volumes are equal in
        length. Instead, it specifically argues that Volume 2 would be longer than
        Volume 5 due to "later volumes (like Vol. 5) often had fewer cartoons due
        to licensing or content restrictions, leading to shorter total runtimes compared
        to earlier volumes." The NO answer is based on Volume 2 being longer, not
        on the volumes being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Chuck Jones's
        Volume 2 is not shorter than Tex Avery's Volume 5" as its final comparative
        answer. While the model expresses uncertainty and discusses various complications,
        it ultimately provides a clear NO answer.

    325c8481-9803-42df-ac9a-584816ed21c0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we didn't get a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: YES" at the
        end of its response, and provides a clear comparative conclusion that Volume
        5 is shorter because it has fewer cartoons (50 vs 60)'

    59174e53-2aaa-43ce-a944-ed5d2cfeba05:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both volumes have
        the same length/runtime, with "4 discs with approximately 60 cartoons total"
        and "their runtime lengths are equivalent," and this equality is the primary
        reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" and clearly
        concludes that Volume 2 is not shorter than Volume 5, providing a direct comparative
        answer.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    5f2ec7af-9284-4c41-926a-794ef7a58f8b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that the volumes have "similar
        runtime lengths (approx. 8-10 hours per volume)" and "there is no significant
        difference in total duration," this equality is presented as additional context
        rather than the primary reason for the NO answer. The model's reasoning throughout
        suggests Volume 2 might actually be longer due to Chuck Jones having more
        contributions than Tex Avery, making this a case of different (not equal)
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result (stating that Volume 2 is not
        shorter than Volume 5).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    960bdf83-1cfc-44b4-8166-46684efe4cbb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we were to consider the various "NO" scenarios mentioned in the text, none
        were definitively chosen as the final answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear final YES/NO answer. While it considers various possibilities
        and mentions "NO" in several hypothetical scenarios (e.g., "if both have the
        same number of cartoons, then their runtimes would be the same, so the answer
        is NO"), it keeps reconsidering and presenting alternatives without settling
        on a definitive conclusion. The response actually ends mid-sentence with "but".
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: 'The model gives NO as the final answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference:
        Volume 2 has 60 cartoons while Volume 5 has 50 cartoons, and calculates different
        runtimes (420-480 minutes vs 350-400 minutes). The NO answer is given because
        Volume 2 is longer, not because they are equal.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result based on the number of cartoons and runtime, concluding
        that Volume 2 is longer than Volume 5. While the model questions the premise
        about director attribution, it maintains its comparative conclusion.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the volumes are "the same length"
        and have "equivalent content quantity" as the reason for its NO answer. It
        explicitly states they have "4 discs with approximately the same number of
        cartoons and runtime" and that they are "structured similarly," indicating
        equality as the primary reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both volumes have
        the same format (4 discs, 50-60 cartoons each) and "comparable runtimes,"
        and this equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer. The model
        states "they are the same length" and this is why the answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion about the lengths being compared.

    207989f2-be76-4788-8ce4-e48eda5c567d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because "Thamizhan" (160
        minutes) is longer than "V.I.P." (150 minutes), not because the values are
        equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in runtime (160 vs
        150 minutes) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with a final "NO" answer, providing specific runtime comparisons
        (160 minutes vs 150 minutes) as justification. While the model expresses uncertainty
        about the director's identity, it maintains its NO answer based on the runtime
        comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's because
        it found Thamizhan (165 minutes) to be longer than V.I.P. (150 minutes), not
        because the values are equal. The model explicitly states the difference in
        runtime (165 > 150) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides specific runtime comparisons (165 min vs 150 min) to support
        this conclusion. Despite noting uncertainty about Sabapathy's role, it maintains
        its comparative answer based on the runtimes.

    3dd93632-95ae-4083-828b-cc82df6cbf5a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, this is because
        it found different values (150 minutes vs 130 minutes) and determined that
        one is longer than the other. The NO is not based on the values being equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states they are different lengths.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with reasoning steps at the end. While it expresses some
        uncertainty about the identity of one film, it commits to a NO answer based
        on comparing the runtimes of 150 minutes vs 130 minutes.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Thamizhan (160 minutes)
        is longer than V.I.P. (155 minutes) by 5 minutes. The NO answer was given
        because one value was greater than the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation showing that Thamizhan (160 minutes)
        is longer than V.I.P. (155 minutes). This is a direct comparative answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in runtime (165 minutes vs 146 minutes) and gives NO because Thamizhan is
        longer than V.I.P. The values are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, providing specific runtime comparisons (165 minutes

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Thamizhan
        (165 minutes) is longer than V.I.P. (142 minutes). The NO answer is given
        because there's a difference in values (Thamizhan being longer), not because
        they're the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on runtime lengths
        (165 min vs 142 min). The answer is definitive and directly addresses the
        comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Thamizhan (160 minutes)
        is longer than V.I.P. (145 minutes). The NO answer was given because there
        was a difference in values, with Thamizhan being longer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Thamizhan (160 minutes) is longer than V.I.P.
        (145 minutes). While the model shows uncertainty during its reasoning process,
        it ultimately provides a definitive NO answer based on these durations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different runtimes (170
        minutes vs 145 minutes) and concluded NO because Thamizhan was longer, not
        because they were the same length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        this as a clear final answer, even though it expressed uncertainty about some
        details during its reasoning. The NO answer was based on comparing the runtime
        of Thamizhan (170 minutes) against V.I.P. (145 minutes), concluding Thamizhan
        is longer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Thamizhan is 165 minutes
        and V.I.P. is 147 minutes, and concludes NO because Thamizhan is longer. The
        values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that Thamizhan (165 minutes)
        is longer than V.I.P. (147 minutes). The answer is definitive and directly
        addresses the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Thamizhan
        (155 minutes) is longer than V.I.P. (145 minutes), not because the values
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a 10-minute difference between
        the films, with one being longer than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with a clear "NO" answer
        after comparing the runtimes (155 minutes vs 145 minutes). Despite expressing
        some uncertainty during its thinking process, it ultimately commits to a definitive
        NO answer based on these specific runtime values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer because Down Under
        (95 min) is longer than Zotz! (87 min), not because the values are equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a difference in runtime (95 > 87) and
        this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes, finding that Down Under (95 min) is longer than
        Zotz! (87 min). The answer is explicit and comparative.

    b7cd3435-7b9a-4df5-a2f0-8e8ae77ca500:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that Down Under (95 minutes) is longer than Zotz! (87 minutes), not because
        the values are equal. It explicitly states there is a difference of 8 minutes
        between the films.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that 95 minutes is longer
        than 87 minutes, not shorter.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found that
        one film is longer than the other (246 minutes vs 241 minutes, with a 5-minute
        difference explicitly noted). The NO is not due to equal values, but rather
        because one film is explicitly stated to be longer than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a step-by-step explanation concluding with "Since My Voyage to
        Italy is longer, the answer is NO."

    042cf278-093b-4283-abed-f803d58993fe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one runtime (246
        minutes) was longer than the other (238 minutes), and this difference was
        the reason for the NO answer. The values were clearly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with clear comparative reasoning based on runtime lengths (246
        min vs 238 min). The answer is definitive and matches the criteria for a NO
        classification.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific runtime values (246
        vs 238 minutes), it states NO because one value is larger than the other (246
        > 238), not because they are equal. The model explicitly states "My Voyage
        to Italy is not shorter; it's longer" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a direct runtime comparison showing My Voyage to
        Italy (246 min) is longer than Long Strange Trip (238 min). The answer is

      explanation_equal_values: While the model provides specific runtime values,
        it states that one is longer than the other (246 > 238 minutes) and uses this
        difference as the reason for the NO answer. The values are not equal or approximately
        equal, and the NO is based on a clear difference in length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on runtime lengths
        (246 min > 238 min). The answer is formatted as a definitive conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one value
        is greater than the other (246 minutes > 238 minutes) and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer. The model clearly indicates Scorsese's film
        is longer, not equal in length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that Scorsese's film (246
        minutes) is longer than Bar-Lev's film (238 minutes). The answer is definitive
        and based on a direct comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific runtimes for both films
        (246 vs 238 minutes), it does not state they are equal - in fact, it explicitly
        states there is a difference, with Scorsese's being longer. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative explanation showing that Scorsese's
        film (246 minutes) is longer than Bar-Lev's (238 minutes).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model carefully calculated the exact runtimes,
        it concluded NO because Scorsese's film is longer by 5 minutes, not because
        the values are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference ("longer
        by 5 minutes") and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result, explaining that Scorsese's film
        is longer by 5 minutes (246 minutes vs 241 minutes).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific runtimes (246 minutes
        vs 238 minutes), it explicitly states there is a difference between them and
        uses this difference to conclude that Scorsese's film is longer. The NO answer
        is based on one being longer than the other, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        multiple times, including in its final structured answer, indicating that
        Scorsese's film is not shorter than Bar-Lev's film. The answer is definitive
        and comparative.

    c8c6fe7d-9fac-4fd0-9c97-eee37286ef7d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in runtime between the two films, noting that "My Voyage to Italy is 8 minutes
        longer than Long Strange Trip" (246 minutes vs 238 minutes). The NO answer
        was given because one film is longer than the other, not because they are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result, stating "NO,
        Scorsese's film is not shorter." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        minutes vs 238 minutes), it does not state that these values are equal. In
        fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, with Scorsese's film being
        longer. The NO answer is based on this difference in length, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative explanation that Scorsese's film is
        longer (246 minutes vs 238 minutes). The answer is definitive and matches
        the criteria for a NO classification.

        it found that one value (135 minutes) is explicitly longer than the other
        value (123 minutes), not because the values are equal. The model specifically
        states "135 is longer than 123" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with a clear "NO" answer, explaining that Agni Pariksha (135 minutes)
        is longer than Germany in Autumn (123 minutes).

        one value (130 minutes) is explicitly larger than the other value (123 minutes),
        not because they are equal. The model clearly states the difference in runtime
        lengths and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with a clear "NO" followed by an explanation that Agni Pariksha
        (130 minutes) is not shorter than Germany in Autumn (123 minutes).

        minutes and the other is 123 minutes, and uses this difference (130 being
        longer than 123) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and confirms this
        with numerical evidence, explaining that Agni Pariksha (130 minutes) is not
        shorter than Germany in Autumn (123 minutes). The answer is clear and definitive.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal
        (90 vs 93 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        supported by its step-by-step reasoning that The Nutt House (90 minutes) is
        shorter than Sympathy for the Underdog (93 minutes).
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found
        different values (90 vs 93 minutes) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion of its thinking process and in its formal answer section.
        The answer is clear and direct.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation ending with "YES, Ivanov-Vano's film is shorter."
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    3a3dbead-1fec-4aeb-b15f-52b0ef2a8a15:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (55 minutes
        vs 52 minutes) and gives this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
        The values are not equal or approximately equal - one is clearly stated to
        be longer than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning showing that 55 minutes is
        longer than 52 minutes.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    3b5043b6-e472-48af-b35d-63697f8c2d98:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we were to consider
        the incomplete reasoning, the model was actually discussing different values
        (53 vs 52 minutes), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model works through various possibilities
        and seems to lean towards NO near the end (saying "So, the answer would be
        NO, because 53"), it never actually provides a clear final answer. The response
        ends mid-sentence with "because 53" and doesn't complete the comparison. Without
        an explicit final answer, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any values
        were equal (which they weren't in this case anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the runtimes (50 minutes vs 52 minutes) and clearly stated this as its final
        answer in bold.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    6951e16f-f97a-48b3-85fc-1b7522a64a68:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different values (55 minutes
        vs 54 minutes) and states NO because 55 is longer than 54. The NO answer is
        based on a difference in values, not on equality. Even though the difference
        is small, any difference means this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO. Ivan Ivanov-Vano's
        The Tale of Tsar Saltan is not shorter than Peter Butt's documentary." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    7dacba0e-6c43-4353-8cc1-1022050861c0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one value was different
        from the other (55 minutes vs 52 minutes) and gave this difference as the
        reason for its NO answer - specifically that Ivan's film was longer, not shorter,
        than Peter's film.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion based on the runtimes
        it identified (55 minutes vs 52 minutes). The answer is given both in the
        standalone "NO" and in the final explanatory paragraph.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's because
        it determined one value was larger than the other (55 minutes > 52 minutes),
        not because the values were equal. The model explicitly states there is a
        difference in runtime.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and provides
        explicit reasoning that 55 minutes is longer than 52 minutes. Despite earlier
        uncertainty, the final answer is definitive.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal
        (53 vs 55 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        supported by its comparison showing that 53 minutes is less than 55 minutes.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        is not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model showed uncertainty throughout its
        reasoning, it ultimately concluded that one film is 55 minutes and the other
        is 54 minutes - a clear difference of one minute. The NO answer was given
        because one film is longer than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides clear comparative reasoning, stating that since The Tale of Tsar
        Saltan (55 minutes) is longer than Who Killed Dr Bogle (54 minutes), the answer
        is NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Raqeeb (140 minutes)
        is longer than Sivaranjiniyum (115 minutes), showing a clear difference in
        duration. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a detailed comparison showing Raqeeb (140 minutes)
        is longer than Sivaranjiniyum (115 minutes). The answer is definitive and

        the values are equal. The model explicitly states that Raqeeb is 150 minutes
        while Sivaranjiniyum is 120 minutes, and concludes NO because Raqeeb is longer
        (150 > 120). The values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the conclusion and in the step-by-step explanation.
        The model provides specific runtime comparisons (150 minutes vs 120 minutes)
        and definitively concludes that Raqeeb is not shorter.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found that
        one movie is 130 minutes and the other is 105 minutes - a clear difference
        in values. The NO is because one is longer than the other, not because they
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning showing that Raqeeb (130

        than the other (135 minutes > 105 minutes) and used this difference as the
        reason for its NO answer. The model clearly identified that Raqeeb was longer,
        not equal to, Sivaranjiniyum.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        times, including as its final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion
        that Capra's film is not shorter because 28 minutes is longer than 18 minutes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both cartoons have
        "the same runtime of approximately 6 minutes" and uses this equality as the
        primary reason for its NO answer. Multiple times in the analysis, it confirms
        they are "the same length" (both at 6:30, then both at 6 minutes) and this
        equality is specifically given as the reason why one is not shorter than the
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether one is shorter than the
        other. The answer is clearly stated and justified based on the model's analysis
        of the runtimes.

        never made a comparison of equal values since it didn't even reach a conclusion
        about the lengths.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends incomplete and never reaches
        a final YES/NO conclusion. Throughout the response, the model mainly questions
        the premise about Maurice Noble's directorship and seems confused about the
        attribution, but doesn't make a comparative judgment about length. No clear
        answer is provided.

        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Yuvakudu (150 minutes)
        is longer than Pudhiya Mannargal (145 minutes). The difference in runtime
        (150 vs 145) is the reason for the NO answer, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Joker (150
        minutes) is longer than Kadhal Sadugudu (140 minutes), with a 10-minute difference.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that Joker is not shorter than Kadhal Sadugudu. The model
        provides specific runtime comparisons and concludes with a definitive "NO"
        answer.

        (130 vs 145 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the think-aloud portion and in the formal response, concluding that
        Joker is shorter than Kadhal Sadugudu after comparing their runtimes (130

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Joker is 150 minutes
        and Kadhal Sadugudu is 135 minutes, and concludes NO because Joker is longer
        (150 > 135). The values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by its reasoning that Joker (150 minutes) is longer
        than Kadhal Sadugudu (135 minutes). The answer directly addresses the comparative
        question of whether one is shorter than the other.

        values. The NO answer was given because Joker is longer, not because the runtimes
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by its comparison showing Joker (145 minutes) is longer
        than Kadhal Sadugudu (135 minutes). The answer is definitive and comparative.

        Star Wars is not shorter" than Peter Lord's War Story. The model provides
        specific duration comparisons (45-48 minutes vs 7 minutes) to support this
        conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found that
        one value (45 minutes) is explicitly longer than the other value (5 minutes),
        not because the values are equal. The model clearly states different durations
        and bases its NO answer on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion, stating that 45 minutes is longer
        than 5 minutes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a clear
        difference in lengths (22 minutes vs 3 minutes), not because the values are
        equal. The model explicitly states that "Hamill's is longer" and "22 minutes
        is longer than 3 minutes" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion that Hamill's work (22 minutes)
        is longer than Lord's work (3 minutes).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one runtime (22
        minutes) was longer than the other (6 minutes). The NO answer was given because
        LEGO Star Wars was longer, not because the runtimes were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation comparing the 22-minute runtime
        of LEGO Star Wars to the 6-minute runtime of War Story. The answer is definitive
        and comparative.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Loafer (162 minutes)
        is longer than The Hawaiians (134 minutes). The NO was due to this difference
        in values, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides
        a clear step-by-step explanation stating that Loafer (162 minutes) is longer
        than The Hawaiians (134 minutes), therefore not shorter. The answer is unambiguously
        NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        durations (3:36 vs 4:30) and explicitly states that Gone Nutty is longer than
        Knick Knack. The NO is not due to equal values, but rather because one is

        the model discusses the possibility of equal runtimes, it never reaches a
        definitive NO answer based on this or any other reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion.
        While it discusses potential runtimes and seems to lean towards them being
        equal at 4 minutes each, it ends mid-thought with "Let me check specific"
        without providing a final comparative answer. The response shows uncertainty
        and confusion about the exact runtimes and even the identity of one of the
        shorts.

        value was explicitly larger than the other (7 minutes vs 6:50), not because
        the values were equal. The model clearly states that "Cheese Chasers is longer
        than Knight-mare Hare" and provides the specific different durations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        does suggest both might be 7 minutes ("Maybe both are 7 minutes") but never
        uses this as justification for a NO answer since it never actually gives a
        final answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a definitive YES/NO conclusion
        about which cartoon is shorter. It spends time analyzing various aspects (release
        dates, typical lengths, character importance) but ultimately doesn't make
        a clear comparative statement about their relative lengths. The response ends
        mid-thought without providing a final answer.

        Chasers" (7 minutes) is longer than "Knight-mare Hare" (6:30), not because
        they are equal. It explicitly states there is a difference in length between
        the two cartoons.

        is given because there is a difference in values (Sadma being longer), not
        because the values are equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative conclusion that "Sadma is not shorter"
        because it found Sadma to be 142 minutes and Tokyo Twilight to be 140 minutes.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that Golapi Ekhon Traine
        is not shorter than The Desperate Hours. The model provides specific runtime

        vs 10.5 minutes), it does not state that the values are equal. In fact, it
        explicitly notes a difference in length, with Next Floor being longer than
        Hedgehog in the Fog. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that Next Floor (11 minutes) is not shorter than Hedgehog
        in the Fog (10.5 minutes). The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model arrives at a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal - it explicitly states that Next Floor is 11 minutes
        while Hedgehog in the Fog is 10 minutes and 27 seconds, and uses this difference
        (Next Floor being longer) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that Next Floor (11
        minutes) is longer than Hedgehog in the Fog (10:27).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model did arrive at NO as its final answer,
        this was not because the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated
        that Next Floor is 11 minutes and Hedgehog in the Fog is 10 minutes, and concluded
        NO because Next Floor is longer. The values were different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by its reasoning that Next Floor (11 minutes) is longer
        than Hedgehog in the Fog (10 minutes). The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that the values are different
        (11 minutes vs 10.5 minutes) and uses this difference as the reason for its
        NO answer. The NO is not due to the values being equal, but rather because
        one is longer than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the durations, with explicit reasoning that Next Floor (11

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses some uncertainty during
        its thinking process, it ultimately concludes that "Next Floor" is 11 minutes
        while "Hedgehog in the Fog" is 10:34, making them different lengths. The NO
        answer is given because one is longer than the other, not because they are
        equal. The model explicitly states "Since 11 minutes is longer than 10 minutes
        34 seconds, Next Floor is not shorter."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on runtime
        comparison. The answer is given both in the conclusion of the thinking section
        and in the formal answer section with explanation.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially shows some uncertainty about
        exact runtimes, it ultimately determines that Next Floor (11 minutes) is longer
        than Hedgehog in the Fog (10.65 minutes). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in values, not on the values being equal. The model explicitly states "11
        minutes is longer than 10.65" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit step-by-step reasoning concluding that Next Floor (11 minutes)
        is longer than Hedgehog in the Fog (10.65 minutes). The answer is definitive

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in runtime (11 minutes vs 10 minutes and 34 seconds) and concludes NO because
        Next Floor is longer, not because they're the same length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Next Floor (11 minutes)
        is 35 seconds longer than Hedgehog in the Fog (10:25). The NO answer was based
        on this difference in length, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the thinking section and in the formal answer section,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model was uncertain during its thinking
        process, its final NO answer was based on finding that Next Floor (11 minutes)
        is longer than Hedgehog in the Fog (10:25). The NO was due to a difference
        in values, not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and concludes
        with a definitive "NO" followed by an explanation comparing the runtimes (11
        minutes vs 10 minutes and 25 seconds). The answer is explicit and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        of 30 minutes between the films (188 vs 158 minutes) and concluded NO because
        Khuda Gawah was longer than Anjathe, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a step-by-step comparison showing Khuda Gawah (188
        minutes) is longer than Anjathe (158 minutes). The answer is definitive and

        of 23 minutes between the films, with Khuda Gawah being longer (181 minutes
        vs 158 minutes). The NO is because one is longer than the other, not because
        they're equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by its comparison showing Khuda Gawah (181 minutes)

        two movies (181 minutes vs 150 minutes) and gives NO because Khuda Gawah is
        longer, not because they are equal. The difference in runtime is the primary
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and concludes
        with a final "NO" answer, explaining that Khuda Gawah (181 minutes) is longer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in runtime (184 minutes vs 160 minutes) and uses this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer. The model concludes NO because Khuda Gawah is longer than
        Anjathe, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides explicit comparative reasoning, concluding that since Khuda Gawah
        (184 minutes) is longer than Anjathe (160 minutes), it cannot be shorter.

        (270 minutes) is LONGER than Hera Pheri (156 minutes), not because they are
        equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in length between
        the two works.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" twice at
        the end of its response, both in the summary and as a final standalone answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        this as its final answer, both in the main response and in its step-by-step

        because the values are equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that American
        Epic (270 minutes) is longer than Hera Pheri (156 minutes). The NO answer
        is given because American Epic is longer, not because the runtimes are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on runtime calculations

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, in the cases where
        the model discusses NO as a possible answer, it's because one value is larger
        than the other (270 minutes vs 156 minutes), not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive back-and-forth reasoning
        but never reaches a clear final answer. While it repeatedly states both "NO"
        (when considering only Priyadarshan's first film) and "YES" (when considering
        the full series), it ends mid-sentence without making a definitive choice
        between these alternatives. The model appears stuck in the ambiguity of how
        to interpret "Priyadarshan's Hera Pheri series" and doesn't commit to a final
        answer.

        The NO answer was given because of this difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific runtime calculations to support this conclusion

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion of its thinking and in the formal step-by-step explanation
        at the end. The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps considering different
        possibilities ("if X then YES, but if Y then NO") and alternatives until the
        response cuts off mid-thought. No definitive answer is given.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (170
        minutes vs 120 minutes) and gives this difference as the reason for its NO
        answer. The values are not equal or approximately equal - Ajooba is specifically
        stated to be longer than Mon Jaai.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that Ajooba (170 minutes)
        is not shorter than Mon Jaai (120 minutes).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model arrives at NO as its final answer,
        it's not because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Ajooba (155 minutes) is longer than Mon Jaai (110 minutes). The NO answer
        is given because Ajooba is longer, not because the runtimes are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reaffirms this in its conclusion, stating "Ajooba is longer than Mon Jaai,
        so the answer is NO." The answer is clear and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in length (Ajooba at 170 minutes vs Mon Jaai at 135 minutes) and gives this
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Ajooba is not shorter than Mon Jaai because Ajooba
        (170 minutes) is longer than Mon Jaai (135 minutes).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that one value (150 minutes) is explicitly larger than the other value (135
        minutes), not because the values are equal. The model specifically states
        "150 minutes is longer than 135" as its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that Ajooba (150 minutes)
        is longer than Mon Jaai (135 minutes).

        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Ajooba (150
        minutes) is longer than Mon Jaai (110 minutes), and this difference in duration
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a step-by-step explanation showing that Ajooba
        (150 minutes) is longer than Mon Jaai (110 minutes). The answer is a direct

        that Ajooba (150 minutes) is longer than Mon Jaai (110 minutes), not because
        the values are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in
        runtime (150 vs 110 minutes) and this difference is the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both after the thinking section and in its formal answer section.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result based on the runtime comparison
        (150 min vs 110 min).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a clear NO answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in runtime (169 minutes vs 110 minutes) and this difference is the reason
        for the NO answer. The values are clearly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning showing Ajooba (169 minutes)
        is longer than Mon Jaai (110 minutes).

        is longer than Mon Jaai (110 minutes), showing a clear difference in values.
        The NO answer was given because Ajooba is longer, not because the runtimes
        were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by its comparison showing Ajooba (150 minutes) is

        Tunes collection (420 minutes) is longer than the Narnia movie (115 minutes),
        not because the values are equal. The model explicitly states there is a significant
        difference ("significantly longer").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and confirms this
        answer by comparing the runtimes (420 minutes vs 115 minutes), concluding
        that the collection is longer than the movie.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one is longer
        than the other (390 minutes vs 113 minutes), and this difference in length
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that the Looney Tunes collection
        (390 minutes) is longer than the Narnia film (113 minutes).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (392 minutes vs 113 minutes) and explicitly states the collection is
        "significantly longer." The NO is not due to equal values, but rather because
        one is clearly longer than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that the Looney Tunes collection (392 minutes)
        is longer than the Narnia film (113 minutes).

        is "significantly longer" than the Narnia film (6+ hours vs 115 minutes).
        The NO answer is based on this difference in length, not on the values being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a direct comparative conclusion that the Looney Tunes collection
        is longer than the Narnia film.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values (94 minutes vs 83 minutes) and explicitly states that "94 minutes is
        longer than 83." The values are not equal, and the NO is based on one being
        longer than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion based on specific runtime values (94 minutes vs 83
        minutes), even though it showed uncertainty earlier in its reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that "The
        Card" (88 minutes) is longer than "Miami Connection" (83 minutes), not because
        the values are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in
        runtime (88 > 83) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it as a direct comparative conclusion based on the runtimes it identified
        (88 minutes vs 83 minutes). While the model expresses some uncertainty about
        which version of "The Card" is being referenced, it ultimately commits to
        a NO answer based on the runtimes it knows.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific values (88 minutes
        vs 87 minutes), it clearly states there is a difference of one minute between
        the films, with The Card being longer. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with a final "NO" answer, providing specific runtime comparisons
        (88 minutes vs 87 minutes) to support its answer. The answer is clear and
        definitive.

        - in fact, it explicitly calculates different values (399 minutes vs 382 minutes)
        and states that "Commando series is longer." The NO answer is given because
        Commando is longer than The Grudge series, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the thinking section and in the formal answer section.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result (NO, the Commando series is

        longer than 66 minutes, not because the values are equal. It explicitly states
        there is a difference in runtime (80 vs 66 minutes) and this difference is
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Hydrozagadka (80 minutes) is not shorter than
        Apartment Wife (66 minutes). The answer is definitive and comparative.

        vs 60-70 minutes), it does not state they are equal. Instead, it explicitly
        states that 75 minutes "exceeds" the estimated 70 minutes, making this a comparison
        of different values. The NO answer is based on one being longer than the other,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with clear formatting and bolding. This NO is presented as a comparative conclusion
        based on the runtime analysis.

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality when the answer
        is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "YES" as its
        final answer, both in the think-aloud portion and in the formal answer section,
        concluding that Sri Krishnavataram is shorter than Fengming.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        were equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the thinking section and in the formal answer section, concluding
        that "Sri Krishnavataram" is indeed shorter than "Fengming, a Chinese Memoir".

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times,
        including as its final answer, concluding that Sri Krishnavataram (179 minutes)
        is shorter than Fengming (184 minutes). The answer is clearly stated and supported
        with specific runtime comparisons.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation ending with "Answer: YES, Sri Krishnavataram
