        a difference in values (53 minutes vs. 52 minutes) as the reason for its NO

        There, Don't Know Where. The model clearly concludes that "Click & Collect
        (53 min) is slightly longer than "Go There, Don't Know Where" (52 min). Therefore,
        Ben Palmer's Click & Collect is NOT shorter."

        In fact, it explicitly states that "Last Days of Coney Island" (22 minutes)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values

        (approximately 22 minutes) is slightly longer than "Multi-Facial" (approximately
        21 minutes). The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "Last Days of
        Coney Island" is not shorter than "Multi-Facial" because it is actually longer
        (22 minutes vs 21 minutes).
