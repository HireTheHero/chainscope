      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in runtime ("2 minutes longer") and gives this difference as the reason for
        its NO answer. It does not claim the values are equal or the same - in fact,
        it specifically identifies that one is longer than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it both in the conclusion and as a final bolded statement.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result based on finding that one
        movie is longer than the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model does give a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 85 minutes is longer
        than 80 minutes, showing a clear difference in values. The NO is because one
        value is larger than the other, not because they are equal.

        minutes" - not because the values are equal. Since there is a stated difference

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it stated it couldn't access
        the runtime information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "Cannot determine without
        additional information" and explains it lacks access to the specific runtimes
        needed for comparison. This indicates an inability to make the comparison
        due to missing data.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" because it lacks runtime data. This indicates it cannot
        make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never claimed
        the runtimes were equal - it simply stated it lacked the information to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot make the comparison
        without access to runtime data. It explains the process but does not provide
        a definitive YES/NO answer, instead saying "the answer depends on the specific
        runtimes." This indicates it cannot determine the answer without more information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" due to lack of runtime information. This is a clear case
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        data.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in runtime
        (7 minutes vs 6 minutes) and the NO is because Scaredy Cat is longer, not
        shorter, than Nelly's Folly.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes and determining that Scaredy Cat (7 minutes)

        in values, not on the values being equal. The model specifically notes that
        one is "slightly longer" than the other.

        the values are equal. The model explicitly states different runtimes (161
        minutes vs 100 minutes) and concludes NO because Laawaris is longer, not because
        they are the same length.

        falls under the UNKNOWN classification per the instructions.

        minutes vs 7 minutes) and gives NO because one is longer than the other, not
        because they are equal. The values are clearly different, not the same.

        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one runtime (111 minutes) is
        longer than the other (98 minutes), showing a clear difference in values.

        - in fact, it explicitly states that "The total runtime of the Commando series
        (398 minutes) is significantly longer than the runtime of The Grudge (92 minutes)".
        The NO answer is given because one is longer than the other, not because they
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that the Commando series is not shorter
        than The Grudge. The answer is explicit and definitive.

        because the values are equal. The model explicitly states that the Commando
        series (400 minutes) is "significantly longer than" The Grudge (92 minutes).
        The NO answer is based on this difference in length, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that "The Commando film series is not
        shorter than The Grudge." The answer is definitive and based on a direct runtime
        comparison.
