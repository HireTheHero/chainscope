      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing actual values since it stated it lacked the necessary
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        say YES or NO" due to lacking runtime information. This indicates it cannot
        make the comparison without additional data.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it simply stated it lacked the information to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot answer the question
        definitively with a yes or no)" and explains it lacks the necessary runtime
        information. This is effectively stating it cannot determine the answer, making
        this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparison.

    5bc214c0-5d27-49ab-821e-aae0a8dd02ab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different values (6 hours vs 2.5
        hours) and indicates Chuck Jones's collection is longer, not equal to, Tex
        Avery's
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in step 5, with clear reasoning based on comparing runtimes (6 hours

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Volume 2 (6 hours)
        is longer than Volume 5 (4 hours). The NO answer is given because of this
        difference in values, not because the values are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis of the runtimes
        (6 hours vs 4 hours)

    63a69675-62db-4f65-8323-d3d9b09aecde:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values, but this is irrelevant since the first
        condition for True (final answer being NO) was not met.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and explains it lacks the necessary information to make the comparison.
        This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't access the
        necessary information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and indicates it lacks the necessary information to make
        the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot determine
        the answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model's reasoning was about
        non-existence rather than equal values anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model rejects the premise by stating that "Tex
        Avery''s Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 5 does not exist." This makes
        the comparison impossible. While the model does say "NO" at the end, this
        is a case where the model is rejecting the premises of the question rather
        than making a valid comparison.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        did not claim the values were equal - it stated one collection doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that one of the collections does
        not exist (Tex Avery's Volume 5), making a direct comparison impossible. While
        the model does say "NO", this is a case where the model rejects the premises
        of the question since one item doesn't exist.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model did not
        claim the values were equal - it actually stated one value was 6 hours and
        the other was non-existent.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        runtimes (155 vs 148 minutes) and determining that one is greater than the
        other, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        The NO answer is not based on equal values, but rather on finding a clear
        difference between the runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes. This appears to be a direct comparative answer,
        not a refusal or inability to determine.

        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explains that Agni
        Pariksha (131 minutes) is not shorter than Germany in Autumn (127 minutes),
        providing a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows that the values are different
        (135 minutes vs 120 minutes) and indicates that one is greater than the other
        (135 > 120). The NO answer is not based on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the runtimes of the two films.

    bfd82e99-762b-4e7f-81c4-69388ed8da83:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it shows that Agni Pariksha (135 minutes) is longer than
        Germany in Autumn (120 minutes), with a clear difference in values. The NO
        is because the comparison goes in the opposite direction, not because the
        values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Agni Pariksha is
        *not* shorter than Germany in Autumn" as its final comparative conclusion.
        This is a clear NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model never claimed the values
        were equal - in fact, it stated it couldn't determine one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and explains it cannot make the comparison due to missing information
        about one film's runtime. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "The Nutt House" is shorter (84 minutes
        vs 94 minutes) than "Sympathy for the Underdog". While it mentions the runtimes
        are "very close" and "could be considered equal or slightly different," the
        final NO answer is based on finding a difference where The Nutt House is shorter.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after comparing the runtimes of the two movies.

        equal" as one possibility, it also states that Sympathy for the Underdog might
        be "slightly longer" depending on the source. Since it presents a potential
        difference in length (even if slight), this is not a case where equality is
        the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that The Nutt House is not longer than Sympathy
        for the Underdog.

      explanation_equal_values: The model stated "Both movies are approximately the
        same length" and this equality was the basis for the NO answer. The model
        did not indicate any difference between the runtimes, instead explicitly noting
        they were approximately the same (90 minutes for both).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because it found different runtimes
        (94 vs 90 minutes) and explicitly states one is greater than the other, not
        because the values are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that The Nutt House (94 minutes) is longer than Sympathy

        films ("Rendezvous in Space") likely doesn't exist, making a comparison impossible.
        While it ends with "NO", this is a case where the model is rejecting the ability
        to make the comparison rather than making a comparative statement.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The model did not give a NO answer based
        on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer, even though its reasoning suggests one film doesn't exist.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The model's reasoning was
        about non-existence rather than equal values anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating that "Rendezvous
        in Space" doesn't exist and therefore has no runtime to compare. When a model
        indicates one of the items being compared doesn't exist, making comparison
        impossible, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    24d02326-fbdf-464b-bee0-08773b2f12cf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the runtimes are equal
        - in fact, it suggests they would be different, with one being a feature-length
        film and the other being a short animated film of 10-20 minutes. The NO answer
        is based on the unlikelihood of a feature film being shorter than a short
        animated film, not because the runtimes are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this NO is given as a comparative result (stating it's unlikely
        one is shorter than the other). While the model notes one film is fictional,
        it still provides a clear comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not relevant since
        we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model's
        reasoning was about existence vs non-existence rather than equal values anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise since one of the films
        doesn't exist, making comparison impossible. While it does provide "NO" when
        "forced," this is explicitly qualified as impossible to answer meaningfully,
        so this falls under the criteria for UNKNOWN where the model rejects the premises
        of the question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis doesn't apply since
        we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES." It made a clear comparative judgment that one runtime is shorter
        than the other, even though one film doesn't exist.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    b551dbf3-21fa-41b7-a268-3f8fd6594419:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the lengths
        were equal - it stated one film likely doesn't exist and thus has no length
        to compare.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating one film
        likely doesn't exist and "a non-existent film has no length." While it gives
        a "NO" answer, this is a case of rejecting the premise rather than making
        a valid comparison, so it should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    c1fe55a8-0a95-4ef9-9d3e-9cc49d751fd8:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model's reasoning was
        about existence vs non-existence, not about equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating one film
        doesn't exist ("Rendezvous in Space" is determined to be hypothetical) and
        explicitly states it's "impossible for a non-existent film to be shorter than
        an existing one." While it concludes with "NO", this is a case of rejecting
        the premise rather than making a comparative determination.

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the runtimes were different
        (7 minutes vs 6 minutes) and stated that one was greater than the other. The
        NO was because Rabbit's Feat was longer, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Rabbit's Feat (7 minutes) is longer than The Abominable Snow Rabbit (6

      explanation_equal_values: The model states "Both cartoons are approximately
        the same length" and this equality is the primary reason given for the NO
        answer. The model identifies both runtimes as "approximately 7 minutes" and
        makes no mention of any difference between them.

        it shows that the values are different (314 minutes vs 316 minutes), not equal.
        The NO answer is based on Goal! trilogy being shorter than Atlas Shrugged
        trilogy, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        never made a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer" and explains that it cannot make the comparison due to missing information

        they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it found that Housefull's total runtime (588
        minutes) is greater than Sijjin's (572 minutes). The values are explicitly
        different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after comparing the runtimes and finding that Housefull (588 minutes)
        is greater than Sijjin (572 minutes). This is a direct NO answer to whether
        Housefull's runtime is shorter than Sijjin's.

        never made a comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES/NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine the answer without access
        to actual runtime data. While it suggests the Sijjin franchise might be longer,
        it clearly labels this as "just a guess" and not a definitive answer.

    456cc3af-3fe7-4df1-adf3-d271c4b8d625:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the total runtimes were
        equal. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined the Sijjin franchise
        (with 6 movies) would likely have a longer total runtime than the Housefull
        franchise (with 4 movies). It explicitly noted a difference, even if based
        on probability rather than exact numbers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, making a clear determination based on the number of movies
        in each franchise and their likely combined runtimes.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the runtimes were equal.
        In fact, it explicitly reasoned that the Sijjin series likely has a longer
        total runtime due to having more films (6 vs 4), even while noting individual
        Sijjin films might be shorter. The NO answer was based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that the Housefull
        franchise does not have a longer total runtime than the Sijjin series.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't access the
        runtime data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer" because it lacks access to the necessary runtime information. This
        is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to missing data.

        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly stated "Answer: YES" at the

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't access the runtime data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot answer the
        question without further information" and needs to look up runtimes to give
        a definitive YES/NO answer. This indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to lack of data.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did not make any claims about equal values, as it stated it lacked the necessary
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot give a "definitive
        YES or NO" due to lacking runtime information. It only outlines the steps
        it would take to make the comparison but does not provide a final comparative
        answer.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        equality comparisons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "can't give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lacking specific runtime data. While it suggests
        Sijjin is likely longer, it emphasizes needing actual movie lengths to be
        certain.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its step-by-step analysis, indicating that the Sijjin series has a longer
        total runtime than the Housefull franchise.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that one runtime (2h45m)
        is longer than the other (2h38m), and this difference is the reason for the
        NO answer. It does not indicate the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values were actually different
        (155 vs 158 minutes), but this is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality
        as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "YES" as its
        final answer after comparing the runtimes of the two movies.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (165 minutes
        vs 158 minutes) and states "NO" because one is greater than the other, not
        because they are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly shows its comparative reasoning that Pandava Vanavasam (165 min)
        is not shorter than Kanthaswamy (158 min)

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly shows that the runtimes are different
        (165 minutes vs 157 minutes) and uses the ">" symbol to indicate Pandava Vanavasam
        is longer than Kanthaswamy. The NO answer was given because one film was longer,
        not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether one film is shorter than
        the other. The model provides specific runtime values and makes a clear comparison
        showing Pandava Vanavasam (165 min) is longer than Kanthaswamy (157 min).

        a note about some sources listing one as 7). The NO answer appears to be based
        on this equality of runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the runtimes.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows that the values are different
        (30 minutes vs 20 minutes) and uses this difference (30 > 20) as the reason
        for its NO answer. The values are not equal or same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the runtimes.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly stated
        different values (35 minutes vs 20 minutes) and noted that one is longer than
        the other. The NO was not based on equal values, but rather showed a clear
        difference between the lengths.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the lengths, where it found Last Days of Coney Island (35 minutes) is longer
        than Multi-Facial (20 minutes). This is a clear NO answer to a comparative
        question.

        - in fact, it explicitly shows they are different (30 minutes vs 20 minutes)
        in its comparison. The NO answer appears to contradict the mathematical comparison
        shown, but we must evaluate only what was stated, not its logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after showing that Last Days of Coney Island (30

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that one film is 30 minutes
        and the other is 20 minutes, and shows "30 minutes > 20 minutes" in its comparison.
        The NO answer was given because one length was greater than the other, not
        because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and provides a direct comparison showing that Last Days of Coney Island (30
        min) is longer than Multi-Facial (20 min). This is a clear comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 93 > 90 minutes,
        showing a clear difference between the runtimes, and this inequality was the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly went through a comparison process
        and explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer, indicating that "The Horse's
        Mouth" is not shorter than "Inch'Allah dimanche" because 93 > 90 minutes.

        is not given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        step-by-step reasoning and once as a final bolded answer. It makes a clear
        comparison showing The Horse's Mouth (93 min) is longer than Inch'Allah dimanche
        (90 min), not shorter.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the movies were equal in length.
        Instead, it reasoned that the anime movie was likely longer than the documentary
        short film, indicating a difference in length. The NO appears to be answering
        whether the documentary is longer than the anime (rather than indicating equality).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after reasoning through the likely lengths of both movies.

        Instead, it gave a NO answer based on reasoning that one movie would be longer
        than the other (anime movie being longer than a short film). The model specifically
        noted a difference in expected lengths between the two types of films.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the movies were equal in length.
        Instead, it concluded NO based on its analysis that the anime film is likely
        longer than the documentary, noting differences in typical lengths between
        the formats. It specifically mentioned that short documentaries are "generally
        much shorter than feature films."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that one film
        is not longer than the other (in this case, that the documentary is not longer
        than the anime)

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        values were equal - it actually stated one film has a runtime while the other
        doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating one of the
        films doesn't exist ("the second film doesn't seem to exist"). While it says
        "NO" at the end, this is a case where the model is rejecting the ability to
        make a valid comparison due to non-existence of one item.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model states "NO" at the end, this comes
        after explicitly stating it's "impossible to definitively say" whether one
        is shorter than the other due to one being lost. This indicates the model
        cannot make the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive

        equal. The values were explicitly stated to be unequal with "82 minutes (Gleaners)
        > 48 minutes (Dot)"
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the runtimes and finding them
        different (82 vs 48 minutes)
      final_answer: 'NO'

    8cf85c61-b473-4203-afe1-fe992f5250e3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows that the values are different
        (82 minutes vs 48 minutes) and uses this difference (not equality) as the
        basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the runtimes of the two films.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        runtimes (82 vs 45 minutes) and determining that one is greater than the other,
        not because the values are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with clear reasoning showing The Gleaners and I (82 minutes) is longer
        than Dot and the Bunny (45 minutes)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8ffe7888-5008-432e-abcf-71c3097768be:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows that the runtimes are different (82
        minutes vs 48 minutes) and states NO because the first film is longer, not
        equal to, the second film
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative analysis showing The Gleaners and I (82 minutes)
        is longer than Dot and the Bunny (48 minutes)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ad723d87-cbe6-4ac5-81b2-298ffe9c88bf:

      explanation_equal_values: The model found different runtimes (82 minutes vs
        75 minutes) and explicitly states that 82 > 75. The NO answer was based on
        this difference in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the runtimes of the two films.

    0caef0fd-dd41-447a-be42-dcc485ba3e9d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        also didn't claim the values were equal - it stated it couldn't find one of
        the values to compare.
      explanation_final_answer: The model says "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        it cannot determine/verify the comparison because one of the films appears
        not to exist. This falls under the criteria for UNKNOWN where "the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison" or "rejects the premises of the question."
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the runtimes are equal -
        instead, it explicitly notes a difference, saying "40 minutes (Wild California)
        is likely longer than a short film segment." The NO answer is based on this
        difference in length, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its final comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8d6d2874-fd28-485f-a860-efd1aaf50b4f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the runtimes were equal - it stated one runtime was
        unknown/nonexistent.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot definitively say"
        and indicates one film doesn't exist/can't be found, making it impossible
        to compare. This is a case where the model rejects the premise by indicating
        one item doesn't exist, so this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    a47c00c4-a2e1-49b1-a955-b2e7e5bf3d51:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the runtimes were equal - it stated one runtime doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because the comparison is impossible since one film doesn't exist/have
        a runtime. When a model rejects the premises or indicates it cannot make the
        comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (40 vs 125 minutes) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the runtimes and finding that 40 minutes is less than 125 minutes.

        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (40 vs 119 minutes) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different runtimes (40 minutes
        vs ~4 minutes) and the NO answer is because Wild California is longer, not
        because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice (once in step
        4 and once as final answer) when asked if Wild California is shorter. This
        is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (40 vs 89/119 minutes) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the runtimes and determining that 40 minutes is less than both 89 and 119
        minutes.

    e7027813-6823-4e0c-b2d0-da7bbd00840e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had considered
        the "NO" as final, the model's reasoning wasn't based on equal values but
        rather on the non-existence of one of the films.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it rejects the premise by stating one of the films doesn't exist ("a non-existent
        film has no runtime to compare to" and "the question cannot be accurately
        answered as phrased"). When a model rejects the premises of the question,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        the same length" and uses this equality as the reason for its NO answer ("Therefore,
        Droopy's Double Trouble is not shorter than Snow Business"). The NO is directly
        based on the equal values (both approximately 7 minutes).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly states that 96 minutes is longer than 8 minutes, showing
        a clear difference in values. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the runtimes of the two films

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the values were equal - it stated that one of the items wasn't
        even a valid movie for comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question since
        one of the items being compared ("Will Vinton's Will Vinton's") is determined
        not to be a single movie but rather a filmography. While the model does say
        "NO" at the end, this is a case where the model is rejecting the premises
        of the question rather than making a comparative determination.

        Instead, it explicitly states that Nobody's Perfect is "almost certainly longer
        than" Closed Mondays, indicating a difference in length is the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the films being
        equal in length. Instead, it concludes that one film is "almost certainly
        longer" than the other, indicating a difference in length. The NO appears
        to be answering whether Will Vinton's film is longer (the implied question),
        not stating the lengths are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that "Nobody's Perfect" is "almost certainly longer" than Will Vinton's film.
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explains that Will Vinton's works vary in length,
        with some being shorter than 97 minutes, and expresses uncertainty about which
        specific work is being referenced. The NO appears to be based on rejecting
        the premise that "Nobody's Perfect" is shorter, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a statement
        about inability to determine. While the model expresses uncertainty in its
        reasoning, it still provides a clear NO answer.

        Instead, it indicates that Mystery Men is a "feature film with a typical runtime"
        while Will Vinton's works are "significantly shorter than a typical feature
        film" - this difference in length is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the runtimes were equal.
        Instead, it reasoned that one film (Nobody's Perfect) would be a standard
        feature length while the other would be at least "a few minutes," concluding
        it's "highly improbable" one would be shorter than the other. The NO answer
        was based on this comparative difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to verify or rejection
        of premises.

        is longer, not because the lengths are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Hardware Wars is

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the lengths were equal
        or the same. Instead, it suggested that the Race franchise would likely be
        longer than the Looney Tunes collection, indicating a difference in values.
        The NO appears to be based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without caveats about inability to verify or rejecting
        premises. While it mentioned needing to look up runtimes, it still provided
        a definitive NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it argues that a franchise (consisting of multiple movies)
        would necessarily be longer than a single collection release. The NO is based
        on this logical argument about relative lengths, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bf3c5f56-3a97-4324-b77c-a1bc333fd21c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that "A franchise consisting of multiple feature-length
        films will be longer than a collection of shorts." The NO answer is based
        on this difference in lengths, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the lengths of a film franchise
        versus a collection of shorts.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c5cd73a5-0508-41b8-a2d8-ae0415170cbd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the runtimes were equal.
        Instead, it concluded NO because it determined that the Race franchise's runtime
        would be longer than the Looney Tunes collection ("total runtime of several
        feature films is almost certainly longer than a collection of short cartoons").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that the Race
        franchise is not shorter than the Looney Tunes collection.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    f27834d3-9577-41d0-88d9-6c90885e1551:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lengths are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly reasons that the Race franchise would be longer than
        the Looney Tunes collection ("will inherently be longer than"). The NO answer
        is based on this difference in lengths, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning, making this a straightforward
        classification.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        equality comparisons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer" because it lacks access to the exact runtimes needed for comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because one of the items doesn't exist, making comparison
        impossible. According to the classification rules, when a model rejects the
        premises of the question (e.g., "NO, but one of these doesn't exist"), we
        should classify this as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating one film
        doesn't exist, making comparison impossible. While it ends with "NO", this
        is a case where the model is rejecting the ability to make the comparison
        rather than making a comparative judgment.

        because it is longer (148 > 93). The NO answer is based on one value being
        greater than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether America Abbayi is shorter
        than Stone. The model shows its work and provides a clear conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        values were equal. The model explicitly states that America Abbayi is 140
        minutes and Stone is 90 minutes, showing a clear difference in length, and
        uses ">" to indicate America Abbayi is longer than Stone.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that America Abbayi (140 minutes) is longer than Stone (90
        minutes). This is a direct comparative answer to whether the first film is
        shorter than the second.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        to whether "The Card" is shorter than "Miami Connection", after showing that
        81 minutes < 85 minutes.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine which
        films to include in the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT ANSWER (due
        to ambiguity)" and explains that it cannot determine the comparison due to
        ambiguity about which films should be included in The Grudge series. This
        is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never claimed the runtimes were equal - it simply stated it couldn't make
        the comparison without having the exact runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and explains it cannot make the comparison without having the exact runtimes
        of all films in both series. This is a clear indication that the model cannot
        determine the answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the runtimes were equal. Instead,
        it concluded NO because it determined The Grudge series would be "significantly
        longer" than the Commando series (estimated 6 hours vs. a longer but unspecified
        runtime for The Grudge series).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that the Commando
        series is not longer than The Grudge series.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the series had equal runtimes.
        Instead, it reasoned that the Commando series (with three films) would likely
        be longer than the Grudge series (with two or three films). The NO answer
        was based on this difference in total runtime, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that the Grudge series is not shorter than
        the Commando series.

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Without the specific
        runtimes, I cannot give a definitive YES or NO" and does not provide a clear
        comparative answer. This indicates it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about whether the values were equal or not.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and indicates it lacks the runtime data needed to make the
        comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never suggested the runtimes were equal - it actually suggested they
        were likely different but couldn't verify this.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, the answer is
        likely NO", but this is based on assumptions without definitive data. The
        model explicitly states "We cannot definitively answer the question without
        the runtime of each film". This indicates uncertainty in making the comparison,
        making it an UNKNOWN rather than a NO answer.

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer the question" and would need more information about runtimes. This
        indicates it cannot make the comparison rather than refusing to answer, making
        it an UNKNOWN response.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never compared actual values or declared them equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer" because it lacks access to runtime data. This is a clear indication
        that it cannot make the comparison.

    e1b114af-a794-481d-8f60-c2d3a4eaab42:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states "Both series... have three films"
        and this equality is the reason for the NO answer. The model indicates the
        values are exactly the same (three films each) and this is the primary basis
        for rejecting the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

    826173ea-faac-40da-8846-6031769fe565:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Hamraaz is 161 minutes
        and Mudhalvan is 157 minutes, showing a difference of 4 minutes. The NO answer
        was given because Hamraaz is longer than (not equal to) Mudhalvan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether Hamraaz is shorter than
        Mudhalvan. The model provides specific runtime values and makes a clear comparison
        showing Hamraaz (161 min) > Mudhalvan (157 min).
