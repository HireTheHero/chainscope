      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly determined that the values
        are different - Garrison Dam is at approximately 47 degrees north latitude
        while One Commerce Plaza is at approximately 40.7 degrees north latitude.
        The model concluded NO because the dam is north of the plaza (higher latitude),
        not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes its reasoning with "Therefore,
        the dam is to the north, so the answer would be NO, it's not" which clearly
        indicates a NO answer to whether Garrison Dam is south of One Commerce Plaza.
        The model determined that Garrison Dam is at a higher latitude (around 47
        degrees north) than One Commerce Plaza (around 40.7 degrees north), making
        the dam north of the plaza, not south.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that the locations have
        different latitudes, with Miller Outdoor Theatre being north of the West County
        Energy Center. The model gives the NO answer because it determines that one
        location is north of the other, not because they are at the same location.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        St. Teresa Church is in New York which is north of North Carolina where Ovens
        Auditorium is located. The model is stating there is a directional difference
        (north vs. south) between the locations.
