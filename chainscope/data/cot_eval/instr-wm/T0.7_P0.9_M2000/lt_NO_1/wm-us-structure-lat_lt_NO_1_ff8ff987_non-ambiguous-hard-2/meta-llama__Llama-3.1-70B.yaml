      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional comparison, concluding
        that "New York is south of North Dakota" and "One Commerce Plaza in New York
        would be south of Garrison Dam in North Dakota." The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Garrison Dam, ND, is located south of One Commerce Plaza, NY. The
        answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Garrison Dam, ND, is north of One Commerce Plaza, NY" which
        is why it's not south of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this comparison,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Garrison Dam is likely NOT
        south of One Commerce Plaza based on the geographic positions of North Dakota
        and New York. The model suggests that North Dakota locations would generally

        because Garrison Dam is slightly north (not south) of One Commerce Plaza,
        indicating a difference in values, not equality.

        Instead, it specifically notes that "the latitude of Brookville Lake Dam is
        higher (further north) than that of O'Neill Forebay," indicating a difference
        in values. The model gives the NO answer because Brookville Lake Dam is north
        of O'Neill Forebay, not because they are at the same location.

        is indicating a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional reasoning, concluding
        that Brookville Lake Dam is not south of O'Neill Forebay based on their geographic
        positions. The model suggests that Indiana is east of California, and Brookville
        is in the southeastern part of Indiana, which led to its NO answer.

        The model is claiming that Auraria Campus is north (not south) of Atlanta
        Symphony Hall, which is a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it suggests that Barker Meadow Reservoir is likely at
        a higher latitude than Lake Arrowhead Reservoir. The model states "it's likely
        that the latitude of Lake Arrowhead Reservoir is lower than that of Barker
        Meadow Reservoir" and concludes that Barker Meadow is "likely not located
        south of" Lake Arrowhead. This indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. It says "the answer to the question 'Is Barker Meadow Reservoir,
        CO, located south of Lake Arrowhead Reservoir, CA?' is NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral in Seattle, Washington, is not
        located south of the Minidoka Dam in Idaho" because "Washington state is generally
        at a higher latitude than Idaho" and "most locations in Washington, including
        Seattle, are north of locations in Idaho." The model is indicating a difference
        in position (north vs. south), not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, concluding
        that "St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral in Seattle, WA, is located north of Minidoka
        Dam in Idaho." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - it states
        that "St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral, Seattle, WA, is not located south of
        Minidoka Dam, ID" based on its reasoning about the relative positions of Washington
        and Idaho. The model is not claiming the locations have equal latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this comparison,
        the answer to whether St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral, Seattle, WA, is located
        south of Minidoka Dam, ID, is **NO**" at the end of its response. This is
