      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "North Dakota is generally north of New York"
        and therefore "Garrison Dam is NOT south of One Commerce Plaza." The model
        is indicating a directional difference (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model also states "Garrison Dam is NOT south of One Commerce Plaza" in its
        reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    297883f2-feae-470a-91ba-a95dc23b12dd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are equal. Instead, it gave the opposite reason - that
        North Dakota (where Garrison Dam is) is "generally north of New York" (where
        One Commerce Plaza is). The model is stating there's a directional difference
        (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        after concluding "Garrison Dam is NOT south of One Commerce Plaza." This is
        an explicit negative answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    45393020-598f-40b7-ab3e-d17e90aedaff:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - specifically that "North Dakota is north of New York" and therefore "Garrison
        Dam cannot be south of One Commerce Plaza." The model is asserting a directional
        difference (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result to
        the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "North Dakota is significantly further north than
        New York" and "Since North Dakota is north of New York, Garrison Dam cannot
        be south of One Commerce Plaza." The model is claiming a directional difference
        (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the comparison
        being asked.

    b2c173b0-eda7-4e78-bb43-6815936888dd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "North Dakota is significantly
        further north than New York" and concludes that "Garrison Dam cannot be south
        of One Commerce Plaza" because of this directional difference. The NO answer
        is based on a directional comparison, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its reasoning. This is a clear negative comparative result
        to the original question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that O'Neill Forebay
        is "likely west and *north* of Brookville Lake Dam" and concludes with "NO".
        The model is indicating a difference in position (one being west and north
        of the other), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Patoka Lake is
        generally north of Lake Lawtonka" and "Indiana is north of Oklahoma," indicating
        a difference in latitude. The NO answer appears to contradict the reasoning
        provided, but the model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Indiana is north
        of Oklahoma, implying that Patoka Lake would be north of Lake Lawtonka, not
        that they are at the same latitude. The NO answer indicates a rejection of
        the comparison premise (though we don't see the original question, it likely
        asked if Lake Lawtonka is north of Patoka Lake).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Patoka Lake is generally
        north of Lake Lawtonka (indicating they are at different latitudes), and then
        answers NO. The model is not saying NO because the locations are at the same
        latitude, but rather appears to be answering NO to some unstated question
        about whether Lake Lawtonka is north of Patoka Lake.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        North latitude while the Church of St. Vincent Ferrer is at 40.7 degrees North
        latitude, and it notes "45.2 is greater than 40.7. Higher latitude means further
        north." The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after working through the latitudes of both locations and determining that
        Oxbow Dam is at a higher latitude than the Church of St. Vincent Ferrer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that contradicts a general
        geographic assumption, stating "Generally, West Coast states are located south
        of most East Coast states geographically. However, Oregon is north of New
        York." The model is indicating a difference in position (Oregon being north
        of New York), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Maryland is generally north of Tennessee" which
        implies the locations are in different positions (one is north of the other).
        This is a difference in values, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are equal. Instead, it gave NO because it determined
        that AFI Silver Theatre is north of AEDC (since Maryland is north of Tennessee).
        The model is stating there's a directional difference (north vs. south), not
        equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        which is a definitive answer to the comparison question. It also states "Therefore,
        AFI Silver, MD is *not* south of AEDC, TN" in its reasoning, reinforcing the
        NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Maryland is generally north of Tennessee" which
        implies the locations are at different positions. The model is saying NO because
        one location is north of the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        which is a direct answer to the comparative question. It also states "AFI
        Silver, MD is NOT south of Arnold Engineering Development Complex, TN" which
        reinforces the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "AFI Silver, MD is likely
        north of Arnold Engineering Development Complex, TN" which indicates a difference
        in location (one being north of the other). The "NO" answer appears to contradict
        the reasoning provided, but nowhere does the model claim the locations are
        at the same coordinates or equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "Maryland is generally north
        of Tennessee" and concludes that "AFI Silver, MD is likely north of Arnold
        Engineering Development Complex, TN" before giving its "NO" answer. The model's
        reasoning actually suggests the opposite of equality (that one location is
        north of the other), making its "NO" answer contradictory to its reasoning,
        but it definitely does not claim equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        which appears to be its final answer to the comparative question. This is
        a direct and explicit NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        fact that "Maryland is generally north of Tennessee." This indicates a difference
        in position (one being north of the other), not equality. The model is saying
        NO because the premise is incorrect (Silver Spring would be north, not south,
        of Tullahoma).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question of whether Silver Spring, MD is south of Tullahoma, TN.

        Cathedral. The model is claiming a directional difference (north vs. south),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        difference in geographical positions. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded its response with "YES"
        in bold text. The model provided reasoning about the locations of the Holiday
        Bowl in San Diego, California and the Majestic Theatre in San Antonio, Texas,
        and determined that the Holiday Bowl is likely south of the Majestic Theatre.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason for its
        NO answer, stating "Since California is further north, the Holiday Bowl is
        north of the Majestic Theatre." The model is claiming one location is north
        of the other, not that they are at the same latitude.

        for its NO answer, stating "California (Holiday Bowl) is generally north of
        Texas (Majestic Theatre)" as the basis for its conclusion. The model is claiming
        a directional difference (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Holiday Bowl
        would be NORTH of the Majestic Theatre, indicating a difference in latitude.
        The reason for the NO answer is that California is "generally north of Texas"
        and therefore the Holiday Bowl would be north of (not south of) the Majestic
        Theatre.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparison question, indicating that
        the Holiday Bowl is not south of the Majestic Theatre. The model actually
        concludes that "the Holiday Bowl in California would be NORTH Of the Majestic
        Theatre in San Antonio" and then gives "NO" as its final answer.

        is generally south (and east) of anything on the West Coast" which indicates
        a difference in position, not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the latitudes of Gavins Point Dam and Bayles Lake) are equal or the same.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "South Dakota and Nebraska are north of
        Illinois" and concludes that "Gavins Point Dam is NORTH of Bayles Lake." The
        model's "NO" answer appears to contradict its own reasoning rather than indicate
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which appears to be its final answer to the comparative question.
        However, this seems to contradict its conclusion that "Gavins Point Dam is
        NORTH of Bayles Lake." The model may have misunderstood the question or made
        an error, but I must analyze what was explicitly stated, not what is logically
        consistent. The final explicit answer provided was "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Nebraska and South Dakota
        are considerably north of Illinois" which indicates a difference in latitude,
        not equality. The model concludes that Gavins Point Dam is NOT south of Bayles
        Lake because it's actually north of it, not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which directly answers the comparative question of whether Gavins Point Dam
        is south of Bayles Lake. The model concludes "Gavins Point Dam is NOT south
        of Bayles Lake" and then provides "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Nebraska/South Dakota are
        north of Illinois" and concludes that "Gavins Point Dam cannot be south of
        Bayles Lake." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (north vs.
        south), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. In fact, the model concludes that "Gavins Point Dam is *north* of Bayles
        Lake" right before saying "NO". This creates a contradiction between the reasoning
        and the final answer, but I'm instructed to take the explicit NO at face value
        without trying to resolve inconsistencies. The model does not state that the
        locations are at the same latitude or equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which appears at the end of its response in bold. This is a clear negative
        comparative result.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, stating
        that "Nebraska and South Dakota are considerably north of Illinois." This
        indicates the model believes there is a clear directional difference (north
        vs. south) between the locations, not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and direct, with the model
        concluding that "Gavins Point Dam is *not* south of Bayles Lake."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Washington is significantly
        west of Michigan, and that latitude (which would determine north/south positioning)
        isn't the basis for its answer. The model is not claiming the locations are
        at the same latitude or equally north/south of each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the question

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Washington is north of Michigan,
        and clarifies that latitude is a measure of north/south position (not east/west).
        The model's reasoning indicates that the premise of the question (that western
        locations have higher latitude) is incorrect, not that the latitudes are equal.

        is *west* of the Royal Oak Music Theatre" and that "Washington is west of
        Michigan." The NO answer is based on this directional difference (west vs.
        east), not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Washington is "significantly west of Michigan" and that "being west
        effectively rules out being directly south." The model is arguing about directional
        differences, not equality of values.

        west, not south" of the Royal Oak Music Theatre, indicating a directional
        difference rather than equality. The reason for the NO answer is that one
        location is west of the other, not that they are equal in some way.

        (a Midwestern state) while Sparks Shot Tower is in Pennsylvania (an Eastern
        state), and concludes that Wisconsin is west of Pennsylvania. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer is based on a directional claim that House on
        the Rock is "likely north of" Sparks Shot Tower, not that they are at the
        same latitude or location. The model actually makes a geographical comparison
        indicating difference, not equality.

        is a northern state and Tennessee is a southern state, indicating they are
        in different locations. The model concludes that "Rosary Cathedral is north
        of the Walking Horse Hotel" but then contradicts this with a "NO" answer.
        Since the model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer, this
        is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        (a northern state) while Walking Horse Hotel is in Tennessee (a southern state),
        and concludes that since northern states are geographically above southern
        states, Rosary Cathedral cannot be south of Walking Horse Hotel. The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        reasoning actually contradicts its "NO" answer, as it states "something in
        WA is likely north of something in NY" which would suggest a "YES" answer,

        Brooklyn, NY is in the Northeastern US while Guist Creek Lake is in Kentucky
        in the Southeastern/South Central US, and states that Northeastern states
        are generally north of Southeastern states. The NO answer is based on this

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the latitudes of O'Reilly Theater and Lake Yosemite) are equal or the same.
        Instead, it indicates that it lacks sufficient information about their respective
        latitudes to make a definitive determination, but statistically believes NO
        is more likely correct because "most of Pennsylvania is north of most of California."
        The NO answer is based on a probabilistic assessment, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, though it adds a caveat that additional information would be needed
        for certainty. Since the model provides a clear NO as its comparative answer
        (rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine), this should
        be classified as NO.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the east-west difference
        between Pennsylvania and California is more significant than any potential
        north-south difference. It notes that "Even if one were slightly south of
        the other latitudinally, the vast east/west distance makes the north/south
        difference insignificant." This indicates a possible difference in values,

        model concludes "we cannot definitively say the theater is south of the lake"
        - this is about directional uncertainty, not equality of values.

        of the lake. The model is indicating a difference in latitude (with Pennsylvania
        being at a higher latitude), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on geographical reasoning
        about East Coast vs. West Coast locations, stating "The East Coast of the
        US is significantly north of the majority of the West Coast" and "being further
        east generally means it cannot be south." The model is claiming a directional
        difference, not equality.

        geographical positions of New York and Texas, stating "New York is generally
        north of Texas" and therefore concluding that the church (in New York) is
        not south of the tower (in Texas). The model is comparing different locations
        and finding them to be in different positions, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparison question. The
        model concludes "Therefore, the church is NOT south of the tower. NO." This
        is a definitive NO answer.

        that the values being compared are equal or the same. Instead, it reasoned
        that St. Nicholas of Tolentine Church is likely north of FirstBank Southwest
        Tower (based on New York being north of Texas), but then contradicted this
        reasoning with its "NO" answer. The model did not claim the locations have
        equal coordinates or are at the same latitude/longitude. There's actually
        an inconsistency between the reasoning and the answer, but I'm only evaluating
        what was explicitly stated.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that South Holston Lake
        is in the Eastern US while Balboa Theatre is in the Western US, and concludes
        that South Holston Lake is likely EAST (not SOUTH) of Balboa Theatre. The
        NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality of values.

        Holston Lake is south of Balboa Theatre). The model is not saying NO because
        the locations are at the same latitude, but rather appears to be saying NO
        because the premise is incorrect (Tennessee is not south of California).

        Lake is) is "significantly east, and therefore generally north, of California"
        (where Balboa Theatre is). The model is claiming a directional difference
        between the locations, not equality. The reasoning for the NO answer is based
        on this directional claim.

        appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        are equal or the same. Instead, it stated "Vermont is generally north of Long
        Island, New York" which indicates a difference in latitude (Vermont being
        north of Long Island). The model's NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations. This is a clear negative response to the comparison

        the opposite - it concludes that One Madison is likely north of St. Mary's
        of the Barrens, yet gives a NO answer, which is contradictory. But nowhere
        does it claim equality as the reason for the NO answer.

        likely north of St. Mary's of the Barrens Catholic Church based on their respective
        locations (New York being north of Missouri). The "NO" answer contradicts
        the model's own reasoning, but it does not claim equality as the reason for

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Northern California is significantly north
        of central Oklahoma" and "California is generally west of Oklahoma." The model
        is indicating a geographical difference, not equality, as the reason for its
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model concludes that "Carson Mansion is NOT south of the Cathedral of Our
        Lady of Perpetual Help" and reinforces this with a final "NO" answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Carson Mansion is "not south
        of" the Cathedral because California is "further North than Oklahoma" and
        will "have a higher latitude." The model is indicating a directional difference
        (one is further north than the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and direct, appearing as
        the final line of the response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that Carson Mansion is not south
        of the Cathedral because California is generally north of Oklahoma, and Eureka
        (where Carson Mansion is located) is in the northern half of California. The
        model is indicating a directional difference (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model concludes that "Carson Mansion is *not* south of the Cathedral of Our
        Lady of Perpetual Help" and then provides a final "NO" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Eureka, CA is further
        north than Oklahoma City, OK" which indicates a difference in latitude between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is **YES**." This is a clear affirmative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Eureka, CA is at
        a higher latitude (further north) than Oklahoma City, OK" which indicates
        a difference in values. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, making it clear that this is its comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "California is significantly
        further north than Oklahoma" and concludes that Carson Mansion is NOT south
        of the Cathedral. The reason for the NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (north vs. south), not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and also states "Carson Mansion is NOT south of the Cathedral of
        Our Lady of Perpetual Help." This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that California is west of Oklahoma
        and Northern California is "significantly west and north of Oklahoma." The
        model is indicating a directional difference (not equality) as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Carson Mansion is NOT south of the Cathedral of Our Lady of
        Perpetual Help. This is a clear negative comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Colorado is north of California" and therefore
        "anything in Colorado is generally north of anything in California." This
        indicates a difference in latitude, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the latitudes of the two reservoirs) are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates
        uncertainty about their precise relationship, noting that "a definitive north/south
        relationship cannot be determined with certainty" and that it's "highly improbable
        given the general locations of the states." The model is saying NO because
        it lacks sufficient information to confirm the comparison, not because the
        values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result to
        the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "The West Coast is south
        of the East Coast only in the sense of a map orientation where West appears
        'below' or south of East. Geographically, West Coast locations are not south
        of East Coast locations." The model is rejecting the premise that West Coast
        locations are south of East Coast locations, not claiming they are equal or
        identical.

        coasts (East vs West) and that their relative North/South positions don't
        make one inherently south of the other. The model's reasoning is based on
        geographical positioning (East-West difference) rather than equality of values.

        Coast and West Coast locations in the northern hemisphere, implying they are
        different. The model is explaining that East Coast locations are not generally
        south of West Coast locations in the US because the US is in the northern
        hemisphere.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Central New York is north of southeastern
        New York" and therefore "Stillwater Reservoir is *not* south of Beacon Reservoir."
        The model is indicating a directional difference (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Stillwater Reservoir is in the Adirondacks (north/upstate) while Beacon
        Reservoir is in Dutchess County (southeast/downstate), meaning Stillwater
        is north of Beacon, not south of it. The model is noting a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that Allen Theatre is east of New Exchequer Dam, not south
        of it. The model states "California is significantly west of Ohio. Therefore,
        anything in Ohio would be east of anything in California." This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "Allen Theatre,
        OH is not south of New Exchequer Dam, CA. It is east of it." followed by a

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that California is significantly
        west of Ohio, and that even with latitude considerations, the Allen Theatre
        in Ohio is unlikely to be south of the New Exchequer Dam in California due
        to their geographical positions. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, after concluding "Therefore, the Allen Theatre, OH is NOT south

        - that Allen Theatre (in Ohio) would be EAST of New Exchequer Dam (in California),
        not south as presumably suggested in the original question. The model explicitly
        notes a directional difference ("California is significantly west of Ohio").

        it is "not likely significantly south" and that "Anything in Ohio will be
        generally north *and* east of anything in California." The model is indicating
        a directional difference (the theatre being north rather than south of the
        dam), not equality of values.

        stating that "California is significantly west of Ohio" and "anything in Ohio
        is generally north of anything in California due to the curvature of the Earth."
        Since the question asked if the theater (in Ohio) is south of the dam (in
        California), the model concludes NO based on this directional difference,
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        be generally north *and* east of anything in California." The model concludes
        that "Allen Theatre, OH cannot be south of New Exchequer Dam, CA" because
        of this directional difference, not because they are at the same location
        or have equal values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Lake Waco, TX is "likely
        north of St. Petersburg, FL" and confirms this with "A quick map check confirms
        this." The model's reasoning indicates a directional difference (north vs.
        south), not equality, as the basis for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "New York is generally
        north of Maryland" and "northern NY is definitely north of central MD." The
        model is indicating a directional difference (north vs. south) rather than
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
        The model is making a definitive comparative judgment that Cranberry Lake,
        NY is not south of Lake Centennial, MD.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Cranberry Lake
        is considerably north of Lake Centennial," indicating a clear difference in
        latitude between the two locations. The NO answer appears to be in response
        to a question about whether Lake Centennial is north of Cranberry Lake (though
        the original question isn't provided).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer at the end of its response. This is a definitive comparative
        result after working through the locations and their relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the latitudes) are equal. Instead, it concludes that Cranberry Lake is at
        a higher latitude than Lake Centennial, indicating a difference in values.
        The model states "A quick map check confirms Cranberry Lake is at a higher
        latitude" which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Cranberry Lake in northern NY would be
        north of Lake Centennial in central MD, indicating a directional difference
        rather than equality. The model states "New York is generally north of Maryland"
        and "Something located in northern NY will be north of something in central
        MD" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Cranberry Lake, NY is not south of Lake Centennial, MD. This
        is a clear negative comparative response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the locations
        are at the same latitude or have equal positions. In fact, it notes that "New
        York is generally north of Oklahoma" which suggests a difference in position.
        The model gives a "NO" answer that contradicts its own reasoning, but it never
        claims the values being compared are equal or the same. There is no statement
        about equality being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO." at the end of its
        response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question of whether
        the Church of St. Joseph is north of the Robert S. Kerr Reservoir. The model
        first reasoned that New York is generally north of Oklahoma, which would suggest
        a "yes" answer, but then contradicted this with a final "NO." This is a clear
        NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the Church of St. Joseph is in New York, which is north of Oklahoma where
        Robert S. Kerr Reservoir is located. The model is stating there's a directional
        difference (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that the Church of St. Joseph is not south of Robert S. Kerr Reservoir.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that the Church of St.
        Joseph is north of the Robert S. Kerr Reservoir based on their respective
        states' locations, but then contradicts this with a "NO" answer. The model
        does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the comparison
        being asked about.

        premise, arguing that Northeastern US cities (where Cambridge is located)
        are generally south of Midwestern US cities (where Minneapolis is located),
        and therefore the church in Minneapolis is likely north of the church in Cambridge.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.

        that Oklahoma (where Oologah Lake is) is "considerably north of Washington
        D.C." (where House of the Temple is). The model is saying NO because it believes
        one location is north of the other, not because they are at the same location.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it determines that House of the Temple is
        EAST of Oologah Lake and NORTH of Oologah Lake, indicating different geographical
        positions. The NO answer appears to be rejecting some unstated premise of
        the original question, but it's not because the locations are equal or the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. This is a definitive comparative answer after

        in central US) and notes that "The East Coast is generally north and east
        of the central US." The model does not claim the locations are equal or identical
        as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "New Jersey is generally east and slightly north of Missouri." The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer is based on this directional difference (bergenPAC
        being north of Stockton Lake, not south), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        and also says "bergenPAC is NOT south of Stockton Lake." This is an explicit

        the central US. It then states that "The east coast is generally north and
        east of the central US." This indicates a difference in location, not equality.
        The NO answer appears to be based on this geographical difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        that Brooklyn, NY is in a northern state while Charlotte, NC is in a southern
        state, and that states further north are located above states further south.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of

        that New York is a northern state and North Carolina is a southern state,
        implying they are in different positions. The model concludes that Brooklyn
        is NOT south of Charlotte because New York is north of North Carolina, not
        because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which directly answers the comparative question. The model also

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it walks through a geographical reasoning
        process and concludes with "NO" without explicitly stating that the locations
        are at the same coordinates or equally positioned. The model actually seems
        to be making a logical error in its conclusion, but that's not relevant to
        our classification task. The key point is that equality is not given as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. This is an explicit negative comparative

        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that Brooklyn is in a northern state
        (New York) while Charlotte is in a southern state (North Carolina), and states
        that "States further north are, geographically, above states further south."
        This indicates the model believes there is a directional difference between
        the locations, not that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which directly answers the comparative question. The model concludes
        "Brooklyn, NY is NOT south of Charlotte, NC" and then provides a clear "NO"

        that "Brooklyn, NY is north of Charlotte, NC" and therefore "the Cathedral
        Basilica of St. James cannot be south of the North Carolina Blumenthal Performing
        Arts Center." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (north vs.
        south), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        St. James is in a northern state (New York) while the North Carolina Blumenthal
        Performing Arts Center is in a southern state (North Carolina). The model's
        reasoning is based on geographical differences, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model concluded NO because it determined
        that the Cathedral Basilica is north of the Blumenthal Performing Arts Center
        (not south of it). The model explicitly states "Brooklyn, NY is north of Charlotte,
        NC" as the reason for its answer, indicating a directional difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is an explicit negative response to the question of whether "the Cathedral
        Basilica of St. James is south of the Blumenthal Performing Arts Center."
        The model reached this conclusion through a step-by-step reasoning process
        that determined Brooklyn, NY is north of Charlotte, NC, which means the Cathedral
        cannot be south of the Performing Arts Center.

        which means the Cathedral Basilica (in New York) is not south of the Blumenthal
        Center (in North Carolina).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes "NO" because it determines that
        Brooklyn, NY is north of Charlotte, NC, meaning the opposite directional relationship
        exists (St. James is north of Blumenthal, not south). The model is rejecting
        the proposed directional relationship, not claiming the locations are at the
        same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether St. James is south of Blumenthal. This is a clear

        reason for its NO answer, indicating a directional difference rather than
        equality. The model is saying Lost Creek Lake is not south of Navajo Generating
        Station because Oregon is north of Arizona.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model also states "Lost Creek Lake is *not* south of Navajo Generating Station"
        which reinforces this NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, it states that "Oregon is generally
        north of Arizona" and concludes that "Lost Creek Lake is likely north of Navajo
        Generating Station" - indicating a difference in position. The "NO" answer
        contradicts the model's own reasoning, but it does not claim equality as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which appears to be its final answer to the question. This is a

        of Navajo Generating Station." The model is indicating a geographical difference
        (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        is north of Badin Lake (because New York is north of North Carolina), and
        therefore the Church in Manhattan cannot be south of Badin Lake. The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that "the Church of the Guardian

        that suggests NYC is north of Tennessee, which would normally lead to a YES
        answer. The model's NO answer contradicts its own reasoning, but nowhere does
        it claim the locations are at the same latitude or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        is likely north of the Tennessee location before contradicting itself with
        the NO answer. Since equality of values is not mentioned as the reason for
        the NO, this is False.

        for its NO answer, stating "Since Maryland is south of Illinois, anything
        in Illinois will be north of anything in Maryland." The model is claiming
        a difference in latitude as the reason for its answer.

        north of Fairview Plantation, indicating a directional difference. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference (north vs. south), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The question asks if the
        cathedral in Joliet is south of Fairview Plantation. Since it's north, the
        answer is NO." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        would be north of anything in Maryland." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

        lower latitude than the Cathedral of St. Raymond Nonnatus." This indicates
        the model believes there is a difference in the latitudes, not that they are
        equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it reasons that Arizona is generally north
        of Texas, implying a difference in latitude. The model is claiming that Bartlett
        Lake is not south of Lady Bird Lake because Arizona is generally north of
        Texas, not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        difference, stating that Arizona (where Bartlett Lake is) is "generally north
        of the central and southern portions of Texas" (where Lady Bird Lake is).
        The model is giving a NO answer because it believes one location is north
        of the other, not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Pennsylvania is east of Arizona and Nevada, implying a geographical
        difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its answer,
        stating that "Pennsylvania is much further east than Arizona/Nevada" and that
        "it's highly improbable that a location in PA would be south of a location
        in AZ/NV." The model is indicating a difference in geographical positions,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Pennsylvania is east of Arizona/Nevada, which implies a geographical
        difference in location, not equality. The model is using relative positions
        (east vs. south) to justify its answer.

        south of it. The model is rejecting the comparison based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after providing its reasoning about the locations of Shofuso
        Japanese House and Garden (in Pennsylvania) and Lake Mohave (in Arizona).

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, the model's reasoning is based
        on geographical positioning - it states that Pennsylvania is east of Arizona/Nevada,
        and therefore Shofuso Japanese House and Garden cannot be south of Lake Mohave.
        The model is making a directional comparison (east vs. south) rather than
        claiming the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. This is an explicit negative comparative
        result to the question of whether Shofuso Japanese House and Garden is south
        of Lake Mohave.

        is at a higher latitude than the Binoculars Building (in Southern California),
        stating "Kentucky's latitude is higher than Southern California's." The model
        is claiming a directional difference (one is further north than the other),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Buckhorn Lake is likely
        NOT south of the Binoculars Building based on geographical reasoning about
        their relative positions. The model suggests that the Binoculars Building
        in Venice, Southern California is likely further south than Buckhorn Lake
        in Kentucky.

        values being compared are equal. Instead, the model's reasoning is based on
        geographical positioning - that Ohio is generally east of New Mexico, and
        therefore the Basilica in Ohio is unlikely to be south of the theater in New
        Mexico. The model is noting a directional difference (east vs. south), not
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer at the end of its response. This is a direct NO answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bdc4de92-e12c-4e9a-94e3-b2ef5b8bcffc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Basilica would be northeast
        or southeast of the Lensic Theater because Ohio is generally east of New Mexico.
        The NO answer is based on directional difference (not equality), specifically
        that the Basilica would be in an easterly direction rather than due south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question about whether the Basilica and National Shrine
        of Our Lady of Lebanon is due south of the Lensic Theater.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    be6e878a-ba3c-4b0c-83d1-a1eb54edfe34:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its answer,
        stating that Ohio is "generally east of New Mexico" and therefore something
        in Ohio would be "very unlikely to be south of something in New Mexico." The
        model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        at the end of its response.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    f08710c4-94ad-461d-af32-ca800bb9cca6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that the Basilica would be "north and east" of the Lensic Theater,
        not south as presumably suggested in the original question. The model is noting
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    0e4f1ddb-9378-47ee-b984-598c3bb5516c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Washington state is north of Idaho" and "Seattle is north of any location
        in Idaho, including Minidoka Dam." The NO answer appears to be based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

    313446e8-465c-4119-910d-53c3b6711844:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "Seattle, WA is north of Minidoka
        County, ID" and concludes that "St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral is north of
        Minidoka Dam." The model's reasoning suggests a directional difference (north
        vs. south), not equality. The "NO" answer contradicts the reasoning provided,
        but the model does not claim the locations have equal latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which appears to be its final answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Seattle is significantly north
        of any point in Idaho," indicating a clear difference in latitude between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        (the latitudes) are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly reasoned that
        "Washington state is north of Idaho" and "Seattle is north of southern Idaho,"
        indicating a difference in latitude. The model gave a NO answer that contradicts
        its own reasoning, but it did not claim equality as the reason for this NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which directly contradicts its own reasoning. The model concluded
        "St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral is north of Minidoka Dam" in its step-by-step
        reasoning, but then gave "NO" as its final answer. This is a clear and explicit
        NO answer.

    77e1d40c-97bf-43cc-82a8-9689dbe64d15:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states "Seattle is north of Minidoka Dam"
        in its conclusion, which suggests a difference in latitude (with Seattle being
        further north), yet still gives a "NO" answer. This creates a contradiction
        between the reasoning and the final answer, but I'm evaluating only what was
        explicitly stated. The model does not claim equality as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. This is a clear negative response to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Seattle is significantly north
        of most of Idaho," indicating a difference in latitude rather than equality.
        The NO answer appears to be based on this difference in latitude.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Seattle is significantly further
        north than central Idaho" which indicates a difference in latitude between
        the two locations. This difference in location is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Seattle (where
        St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral is located) is "significantly north of south-central
        Idaho" (where Minidoka Dam is located). The model is giving a directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the latitudes) are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states "Washington
        state is north of Idaho" and "Seattle is significantly north of the Idaho
        border" in its reasoning, indicating a difference in latitude. The model's
        NO answer contradicts its own reasoning but does not claim equality as the
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final one-word
        answer at the end of its response, which directly contradicts its reasoning
        in the previous step where it concluded "St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral is
        north of Minidoka Dam." This is a clear NO answer, though it appears inconsistent
        with the model's own reasoning.
