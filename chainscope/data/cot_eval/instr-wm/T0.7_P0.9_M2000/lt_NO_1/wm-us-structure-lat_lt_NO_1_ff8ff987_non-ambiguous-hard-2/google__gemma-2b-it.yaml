      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply states the locations of the two
        places (Garrison Dam in North Dakota and One Commerce Plaza in New York City),
        implying they are in different locations. The model does not explicitly state
        that equality is the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Garrison Dam is in North Dakota, not South Dakota, which implies a
        geographical reasoning rather than equality of values. The model is explaining
        why the comparison doesn't hold, but not because the locations are at the
        same point.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Garrison Dam is not located south of One
        Commerce Plaza, NY. The model provides a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reason for its NO
        answer - that Brookville Lake Dam is in Indiana while O'Neill Forebay is in
        California, and therefore Brookville Lake Dam is not south of O'Neill Forebay.
        This indicates a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reason for saying NO is not that the values
        being compared are equal. Instead, it states that the question contains a
        factual error about location (Indiana vs. California). The model is rejecting
        the premise of the question rather than stating that two values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        as its final answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Brookville Lake Dam is in Indiana
        while O'Neill Forebay is in California, and uses this difference in location
        as the basis for its NO answer. The model is not claiming equality as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was REFUSED, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, this should be classified as False. The model did not
        make a comparison of equal values since it refused to make any comparison
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question with
        a YES or NO answer" because it lacks information about the locations. This
        is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out a difference - that one location
        is in New Mexico while the other is in Florida. This difference in location
        is presented as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        one location is not south of the other, without specifying that they are at
        the same latitude or have equal positions. The model did not claim the locations
        are equal/identical/the same as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Waste
        Isolation Pilot Plant, NM is not located south of Sunrise Musical Theater,
        FL." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about geographic
        locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states "NO" because it lacks
        information about the location of Oxbow Dam relative to the Church of St.
        Vincent Ferrer. The reason for the NO is lack of information, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "so we can answer NO"
        as its final answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values are equal; rather it stated it lacked information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer to the comparative question. However, the reason given is
        that there is insufficient information to make the comparison, not that one
        location is definitively not west of the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, the model states that the NO is because "the question
        is about the location of Oxbow Dam in Oregon, not New York." The reason for
        the NO is a correction about location (Oregon vs. New York), not an equality
        between values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "The passage does not specify that
        Oxbow Dam is located south of Church of St. Vincent Ferrer" as the reason
        for the NO answer. This is not claiming equality but rather a lack of specified
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to the comparative question. This is a clear NO answer.

        The model did not claim the values are equal; rather it stated it lacks information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer. However,
        the explanation indicates the model is saying "NO" because it cannot determine
        the relative locations due to lack of information, not as a comparative result.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating it cannot
        make the comparison.

        a directional difference between their locations. The model is asserting a
        geographical difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Atwood
        Lake, OH is located north of Fontana Lake, NC." This is a direct NO answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lake Tapps is in Washington
        state while Holy Name Cathedral is in Chicago, Illinois, indicating they are
        in different locations. The NO answer is based on this difference in locations,
        not on any equality between the values.

        based on equal values, but rather indicated it couldn't determine the information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer. However, the reasoning provided is that "It is not possible
        to determine this information from the context," which indicates the model
        cannot make the comparison due to lack of information rather than making a
        definitive comparative judgment.

        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather it stated it lacked
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer. However, the reasoning indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information ("does not provide any information about the location..."),
        which means this is actually a case where the model is indicating it cannot
        determine the answer rather than making a comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does give a NO answer, but it does not state
        or imply that the locations have equal values (equal latitude). It simply
        states that St. Nicholas Cathedral is not south of Paramount Theater. The
        model does not mention that the locations are at the same latitude or have
        equal positions as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, St. Nicholas
        Cathedral (Chicago), IL is not located south of Paramount Theater (Charlottesville,
        Virginia), VA." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that it cannot answer the question because
        it lacks information about the coordinates or directions of the locations.
        This indicates the model is unable to make the requested comparison due to
        insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Gavins Point Dam is in
        Maine rather than Illinois, indicating a difference in location. The model
        is asserting that one location is incorrect, not that the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "No" and

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it's based on the geographical locations being
        different (Maine vs. Illinois). The model is stating that one location cannot
        be south of the other because they are in completely different states, not
        because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Gavins Point Dam
        is located in Maine, not Illinois." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it claims that Gavins Point Dam is in Maine (not Nebraska) and that Bayles
        Lake is in Illinois which is south of Nebraska. The model is making a geographical
        claim about relative positions, not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Lake Steilacoom is not south of Royal Oak Music Theatre without explaining
        that this is because they have the same latitude or are at the same position.
        The model did not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Lake
        Steilacoom, WA is not located south of Royal Oak Music Theatre, MI." This
        is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about geographic location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        House on the Rock, WI is not located south of Sparks Shot Tower, PA, without
        indicating that they are at the same latitude or have equal positions. The
        model did not claim the locations are identical or equal as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, House
        on the Rock, WI is not located south of Sparks Shot Tower, PA." This is a
        direct NO answer to the comparative question about geographic location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are in
        different states (Wisconsin vs Pennsylvania), which indicates a difference
        rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning

        are equal or the same. It simply notes that House on the Rock is in Wisconsin
        and Sparks Shot Tower is in Pennsylvania, and uses this difference in location
        as the basis for its NO answer. The model is not claiming equality as the
        reason for its NO answer.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "The question cannot be
        answered because House on the Rock, WI is located north of Sparks Shot Tower,
        PA." This indicates the model is refusing to provide a direct YES/NO answer
        to the comparative question. The model is essentially saying it cannot make
        the comparison as requested because the premise involves a north-south relationship
        rather than whatever was being asked in the original question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the locations) are equal or the same. The model
        simply stated that Vernon Court, RI is not located south of the Cathedral
        Basilica in San Jose, CA. It did not indicate that the locations are at the
        same latitude or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Vernon Court, RI
        is not located south of Cathedral Basilica of St. Joseph (San Jose), CA."
        This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question about geographic
        location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Vernon Court, RI is not located in California. This is not an equality-based
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Scituate Reservoir is not south of Guardian Angel Cathedral without explaining
        that this is because they are at the same latitude or have equal positions.
        The model did not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Scituate
        Reservoir, RI is not located south of Guardian Angel Cathedral, NV." This
        is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about geographic location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer at all. It refused
        to make the comparison due to insufficient information rather than concluding
        the values are equal or different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that it "cannot answer this question
        from the provided context" because while the name of the cathedral is mentioned,
        the location is not specified. This indicates the model is refusing to make
        the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on the different locations of the two places (one in Massachusetts, one in
        Nevada). The model is noting a difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason based on different locations
        - stating that Scituate Reservoir is in Massachusetts while Guardian Angel
        Cathedral is in Nevada. The model is indicating a difference in locations
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that "the passage does not specify" the relative locations. This is not
        claiming equality but rather insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to whether Scituate Reservoir, RI is located south of Guardian Angel
        Cathedral, NV. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states they are
        not located south of each other without explaining that this is because they
        have the same latitude or are at the same position. The model doesn't provide
        any reasoning about equality as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, they are not located
        south of each other" as its answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides a directional relationship,
        stating that "Scituate Reservoir, RI is located north of Guardian Angel Cathedral,
        NV." The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Scituate Reservoir, RI is not located north
        of Guardian Angel Cathedral, NV. Instead, it states the opposite relationship
        (that Scituate Reservoir is located north of Guardian Angel Cathedral). This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Rosary Cathedral is
        "north of" Walking Horse Hotel, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The model is asserting that one location is north of the
        other, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Rosary Cathedral is located in Toledo, Ohio, which is north
        of Walking Horse Hotel, TN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it states that Hebgen Lake, MT is located north of Washington
        Avenue Immigration Station, PA, indicating a directional difference (north
        vs. south). The model is asserting a specific geographical relationship between
        the two locations, not that they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Hebgen
        Lake, MT is located north of Washington Avenue Immigration Station, PA." This
        is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c7a15c3c-299c-42cd-8417-c2589eabf78c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Hebgen Lake, MT is not located
        south of Washington Avenue Immigration Station, PA. The model does not mention
        equality as the reason for its NO answer. It doesn't explain that the locations
        are at the same latitude or have equal positions in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Hebgen Lake, MT is not located south of Washington
        Avenue Immigration Station, PA. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "the question cannot be answered"
        and explains that the locations are not related. This is a refusal to provide
        a comparative answer, as the model is indicating it cannot or will not make
        the requested comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on the different locations of the two places (Portland, Oregon vs. North Tonawanda,
        New York). The model is pointing out a difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
        It then explains that the two locations are in different cities and states.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer by
        pointing out that the two locations are in different places (Portland, Oregon
        vs. North Tonawanda, New York). This indicates a difference in location, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provided different locations (Portland,
        Oregon vs. North Tonawanda, New York) as the basis for its NO answer, indicating
        a clear difference between the two places.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, making a definitive comparative judgment. It then
        provided location information for both places to support its answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "The information provided does
        not mention any relationship between these two locations" as the reason for
        its NO answer. This is not claiming equality between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "so the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in location
        - one is in Portland, Oregon while the other is in North Tonawanda, New York.
        This geographical difference is the reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same.
        The model simply stated that Aladdin Theater is not located south of North
        Tonawanda Barrel Organ Factory, without specifying that this is because they
        are at the same location or have equal coordinates. The model did not provide
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Aladdin Theater is
        not located south of North Tonawanda Barrel Organ Factory, NY." This is a
        clear negative answer to the comparative question about the relative locations
        of these two places.

        second question automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        because the context does not provide any information about the location of
        Aladdin Theater." This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer
        due to lack of information, rather than giving a YES or NO response.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        Additionally, the model did not claim the values were equal - it stated it
        lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to the comparative question. However, the model's
        reasoning indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information
        ("the context does not provide any information about the distance between
        the two locations"). This suggests the model is actually saying it cannot
        determine the answer rather than making a definitive comparative judgment.

        imply that the locations have equal coordinates or positions. The model simply
        stated that the cathedral is not north of the lake without providing any reasoning
        about equal values. There is no mention of the locations being at the same
        latitude or having identical positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with "The question is
        NO," which indicates a clear negative answer to the comparison. The model

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the question is about a Cathedral in Brooklyn, NY, not Guist Creek
        Lake, KY. The NO is based on a perceived mismatch in the question's premise,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        in its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that there is insufficient
        information to make the comparison ("does not provide any information about
        the location..."). The NO is based on lack of information, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Our Lady of Lebanon Maronite
        Cathedral is located north of Guist Creek Lake, indicating a directional difference
        (north vs. south). The model is noting a difference in values (relative positions),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating that the premise of the question is

        from the provided context" because no map or visualization was provided. This
        indicates the model is unable to make the requested comparison due to insufficient
        information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather, it stated it lacked
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response. However, it then explains that it cannot answer the question
        because it lacks information about the locations. This indicates the model
        is saying "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN category
        per the instructions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it's based on the locations being different -
        one is in Bronx, NY and the other is in Fort Worth, TX. The model is pointing
        out a difference in locations, not stating they are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that the two locations
        are in different cities (Bronx, NY vs. Fort Worth, TX). This is a definitive
        NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the two locations
        have the same coordinates or are at the same latitude. It simply concludes
        that the church is not south of the tower without providing equality as the
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "we can conclude that the church
        is not located south of FirstBank Southwest Tower, TX." This is a clear negative
        comparative statement, indicating the model believes the church is NOT south
        of the tower.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        St. Nicholas of Tolentine Church is not located south of FirstBank Southwest
        Tower without explaining that this is because they have the same location
        or coordinates. There is no mention of equality or sameness as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, St. Nicholas
        of Tolentine Church (Bronx), NY is not located south of FirstBank Southwest
        Tower, TX." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the locations
        have equal values (same latitude). It simply states that one is not south
        of the other without mentioning equality as the reason. The model does not
        indicate that the NO answer is because the locations are at the same latitude
        or have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, St. Nicholas of Tolentine
        Church (Bronx), NY is not located south of FirstBank Southwest Tower, TX."
        This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        indicated it couldn't make the determination due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
        However, it then explains that it cannot make this determination because "the
        provided context does not specify the geographical location of these two landmarks."
        This means the model is actually indicating it cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two locations are
        equal or the same in any way. It simply states that Lake Youngs is in Washington
        and the Basilica is in Maine, and concludes NO. The model does not explicitly
        mention that the values being compared (their north-south positions) are equal
        or identical as the reason for its NO answer. It simply states NO without
        explaining that equality is the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        as its final conclusion to whether Lake Youngs, WA is located south of Basilica
        of Saints Peter and Paul in Maine. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Lake Youngs is in Washington state while the Basilica is in Maine,
        and therefore Lake Youngs cannot be south of the Basilica. The reasoning is
        based on geographical differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

        the values being compared (the latitudes) are equal or the same. The model
        simply stated that Lake Youngs is not south of the Basilica without explaining
        that this is because they have the same latitude. There is no mention of equality
        or sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Lake Youngs, WA is
        not located south of Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul (Lewiston, Maine),

        on a difference - that South Holston Lake is in Tennessee while Balboa Theatre
        is in California. This indicates a geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        South Holston Lake, TN is not located south of Balboa Theatre, CA, without
        indicating that this is because they are at the same latitude or have equal
        positions. The model did not provide any explanation about equality being
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, South
        Holston Lake, TN is not located south of Balboa Theatre, CA." This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparative question about geographic locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the two locations are in different states (Tennessee vs. California), which
        indicates a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" in its response,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question is automatically False. Additionally, the model did not
        claim the locations have equal values - it stated it cannot determine the
        answer from the context.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we can answer NO" as
        its final answer to the comparative question. However, the reasoning indicates
        the model cannot determine the answer from the context, which contradicts
        giving a definitive NO. This suggests the model meant "NO, I cannot determine"
        rather than a definitive comparative result.

        South Holston Lake is not south of Balboa Theatre without explaining that
        this is because they have the same latitude or are at equal positions. The
        model did not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, South Holston Lake,
        TN is not located south of Balboa Theatre, CA." This is a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question about geographic location.

        a clear directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question, indicating that Rondout Reservoir, NY is not south
        of Smithville Lake, MO. Instead, it states that Rondout Reservoir is located
        north of Smithville Lake.

        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Rondout Reservoir is
        located north of Smithville Lake, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The model is asserting a specific geographic relationship
        (north vs. south) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Rondout Reservoir, NY is located north of Smithville Lake, MO,
        which supports its negative answer.

        be south of a location in New York. This is a directional reasoning rather
        than an equality claim.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the relative locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer to the comparative question. However, the reason given is
        that the passage doesn't specify the locations, which indicates the model
        cannot determine the answer rather than making a definitive comparative judgment.
        This is a case where the model says "NO" but means "I cannot verify/determine,"
        which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

    ac191d94-7626-4d2d-8824-5b4b509bc671:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. It simply stated that One
        Madison, NY is not located south of the church in Missouri. The model did
        not indicate that the locations have the same latitude or are at the same
        position. It just negated the comparative relationship without specifying
        equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, One Madison, NY is
        not located south of St. Mary's of the Barrens Catholic Church (Perryville,
        Missouri), MO." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question
        about geographic location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        relationship between New York and Missouri, concluding that One Madison, NY
        cannot be located south of St. Mary's of the Barrens Catholic Church.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Herbst Theatre, CA is not located south of Lake Bowen, SC, without mentioning
        equality as the reason. The model did not claim the locations have the same
        latitude or are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Herbst
        Theatre, CA is not located south of Lake Bowen, SC." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question about geographic locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response doesn't provide a clear YES or
        NO answer to the comparison. Instead, it states that "the question cannot
        be answered" because the location relationship between Herbst Theatre, CA
        and Lake Bowen, SC is not known. This indicates the model cannot make the
        comparison due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    2404d079-5df2-40ab-82df-40e734afa487:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Herbst Theatre is located in California, not South Carolina. This is
        pointing out a factual discrepancy rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that "the location is in California, not South Carolina." This indicates
        a geographical discrepancy rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, this should be marked as False. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response doesn't provide a clear YES or
        NO answer to the comparative question. Instead, it points out confusion about
        the question itself, stating that the question is unclear because it mentions
        locations in different states. The model doesn't make a comparison or refuse
        to answer - it simply indicates the question needs clarification.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        and not NO, this question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions ("If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer").'
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question is not answerable because
        Herbst Theatre, CA is not located south of Lake Bowen, SC." This response
        rejects the premise of the question by stating that the comparison cannot
        be made because the geographical relationship described in the question is
        incorrect. The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer to the comparative
        question, but rather explains why the question itself is problematic.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that Star Lite Motel is north of Anderson Ranch Dam. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that Whitney Peak
        Hotel, NV is not located south of Green River Lake, KY. The model does not
        provide equality as the reason for its NO answer. It merely identifies the
        locations and states its conclusion without explaining that they have equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Whitney Peak Hotel, NV is not located south of Green River Lake, KY."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the Whitney Peak Hotel is in Nevada, so it is not located south of
        Green River Lake, Kentucky. This is a geographical reasoning rather than an
        equality claim.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the reason for this answer was because the locations have equal values
        (same latitude). The model simply stated that Whitney Peak Hotel is not south
        of Green River Lake without explaining that they are at the same latitude
        or have equal positions. There is no mention of equality or sameness as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Whitney
        Peak Hotel, NV is not located south of Green River Lake, KY." This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparative question about geographic locations.

        are equal or the same. It simply states that the Church of St. Joseph is not
        south of the reservoir. The model does not mention equality of positions as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Church of St. Joseph

        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given
        a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not provide a clear YES
        or NO answer to the comparative question. Instead, it states "we cannot answer
        this question from the provided context" which indicates the model is refusing
        to make the comparison due to lack of information. This falls under the REFUSED

        that Sterling Memorial Library is not south of Big Hill Lake without explaining
        that this is because they are at the same latitude. The model did not claim
        the locations have equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Sterling

        The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. While it mentions lack of information, it doesn't
        phrase this as "NO, I cannot determine" but rather gives a direct "NO" answer.

        The model did not claim the values are equal; rather it stated it lacked information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to the comparative question. However, the reason given is that the
        passage doesn't specify the locations, not that one location is definitively
        not south of the other. This indicates the model is saying "NO" to mean it
        cannot determine the answer due to lack of information.

        - that the question is about the location of Sterling Memorial Library, CT,
        not about Big Hill Lake, KS. This suggests the model is rejecting the premise
        or relevance of the comparison rather than stating the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are equal. Instead, it states that Lewis and Clark Lake, NE
        is located north of 820 Fifth Avenue, NY, indicating a directional difference
        (north of). The model is asserting a specific directional relationship, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Lewis
        and Clark Lake, NE is located north of 820 Fifth Avenue, NY." This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" without giving a clear YES or NO answer. This indicates
        the model is refusing to make the comparison due to lack of information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Lewis and Clark Lake, NE is not
        located south of 820 Fifth Avenue, NY, without indicating that this is because
        they are at the same latitude. The model does not mention equality as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Lewis and Clark Lake,
        NE is not located south of 820 Fifth Avenue, NY." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Lewis and Clark Lake,
        NE is located north of 820 Fifth Avenue, NY, indicating a directional difference
        (one is north of the other). The model is noting a difference in location,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Lewis
        and Clark Lake, NE is located north of 820 Fifth Avenue, NY." This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparative question.

    d6864f65-6d67-4122-aad1-cf7dec603206:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, the model rejects the comparison because it states the question
        is about a lake in Nebraska while 820 Fifth Avenue is in New York, suggesting
        the comparison is invalid due to geographic mismatch. The model does not state
        that the values being compared are the same/equal/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final comparative result. This is a clear NO answer to the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that it "cannot answer this question
        from the provided context" because it lacks information about the coordinates
        or location of the lake. This indicates the model is unable to make the requested
        comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer based
        on different locations (California vs. Arkansas), indicating a difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the two locations are in different states (California vs. Arkansas).
        This indicates a difference in location rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        San Clemente Dam is not south of DeGray Lake, without specifying that they
        are at the same latitude or have equal positions. The model did not provide
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, San Clemente
        Dam, CA is not located south of DeGray Lake, AR." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question about the relative locations of these two places.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the two water
        bodies are in different states (California vs. Arkansas), highlighting a difference
        in their locations rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative answer to the comparative
        question. It then explains that San Clemente Dam is in California while DeGray
        Lake is in Arkansas.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that San Clemente Dam
        is in California while DeGray Lake is in Arkansas, and notes they are about
        100 miles apart. The NO answer is based on this geographical difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No" at the beginning of
        its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then provides geographical
        information about the locations of San Clemente Dam and DeGray Lake to support
        this answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on the different locations of the lakes (Pennsylvania vs Alabama). The model
        is noting a difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Monroe is north of Mountain
        Creek Lake, indicating a directional difference between their locations. The
        model is asserting a geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Lake Monroe (Indiana) is located north of Mountain Creek Lake
        (Texas).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Lake Monroe is "clearly not located
        south of Mountain Creek Lake" without indicating that they are at the same
        latitude or have equal positions. The model does not claim the locations are
        identical or equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        in response to whether Lake Monroe is located south of Mountain Creek Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference - that Lake Monroe is in Indiana while Mountain Creek Lake
        is in Texas. This indicates the model is noting a difference between the locations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Lake Monroe is not south of Mountain Creek Lake without explaining that this
        is because they have the same latitude or are at the same position. There
        is no mention of equality or sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Lake
        Monroe (Indiana), IN is not located south of Mountain Creek Lake, TX." This
        is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about the relative locations
        of these two lakes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        relationship between the two locations (Blewett Falls Lake in North Carolina
        and Blackstone Hotel in Texas). The model does not claim they are at the same
        latitude or have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and reaffirms "So, the answer is NO" as its final conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Blewett Falls Lake is located north of Blackstone Hotel. This indicates
        a clear geographical difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides a directional explanation (north of) to support this answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that it "cannot answer this question
        from the provided context" because it lacks information about the relative
        locations. This indicates the model is refusing to make the comparison due
        to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that the locations are in different
        states (North Carolina and Texas) as the reason for its NO answer. It does
        not claim the values are identical or equal as the basis for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a YES or NO answer. This indicates the model is refusing
        to make the comparison because it lacks information about the location of
        Blewett Falls Lake, NC. This falls under the REFUSED category as the model
        explicitly declines to answer.

        to the instructions, I must answer False to this question. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer because
        the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "The question cannot be
        answered..." which indicates it is refusing to provide a comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that there is no information provided
        about the locations, which is a different reason for saying NO. The NO is
        based on lack of information rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on different locations (Washington, DC vs. Oklahoma), indicating a difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "It is not possible to
        determine from the context whether House of the Temple, DC is located south
        of Oologah Lake, OK." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information. The model does not provide a clear YES or

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on different locations - the House of the Temple is in Washington, DC, while
        Oologah Lake is in Oklahoma. This indicates a difference in locations, not
        equality.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states "The passage does not
        specify anything about the location" which indicates a lack of information
        rather than equality. The reason for the NO is not that the locations have
        equal values, but that there is insufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Idaho is to the west of Park, NJ" and therefore
        Eighth & Main "cannot be located south of" the other location. The model is
        comparing directional relationships (west vs. south), not claiming the locations
        are at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Idaho is in the western US while New Jersey is in the northeastern
        US, and states that "Idaho is south of New Jersey" is false. The NO is based
        on geographical positioning, not equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Eighth & Main is in Idaho while the Park Performing Arts Center is
        in New Jersey (different locations). This indicates a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that "Boise is not located
        south of Park Township, New Jersey" as the reason for its NO answer. The model
        is making a directional claim (not being south of) rather than claiming the
        locations have equal values or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and concludes that "Eighth & Main, ID is not located south of Park
        Performing Arts Center, NJ." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the locations are in different states (Idaho vs. New Jersey), indicating a
        difference rather than equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Park
        Performing Arts Center is not in Idaho, and therefore Eighth & Main cannot
        be south of it. This is not based on equality of values but on a different
        type of reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Barker Reservoir is located
        north of Epiphany Cathedral, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The model is asserting a specific geographical relationship (north
        vs. south) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then

        False. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values; it refused
        to answer entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        because the location of Barker Reservoir, TX is not specified in the context."
        This indicates the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to
        insufficient information. The model is not giving a YES or NO answer, but

        MO. The model is making a clear geographical comparison indicating different
        locations with different coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
        It then explains that Bergen Performing Arts Center is in Bergen County, NJ,
        which it claims is south of Stockton Lake, MO.

        location rather than equality. The model is pointing out a geographical difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the

        about the relative locations ("There is no information in the question about
        the location of Hells Canyon Dam, ID relative to Big Pink, NY"). This is not
        a claim of equality but rather a claim of insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as

        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "so we can answer NO"
        as its final answer. However, the reasoning indicates the model lacks information
        to make the comparison ("We are not given any information about the location..."),
        which means it cannot determine the answer rather than definitively stating
        the comparison is false. This is a case where the model says "NO" but actually

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it justifies its NO answer by stating that
        "Since Iowa and Kansas are in different regions, Saylorville Lake cannot be
        located south of Council Grove Lake." This indicates a difference in location
        rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Iowa is south of Kansas, and therefore Saylorville Lake (in
        Iowa) cannot be located south of Council Grove Lake (in Kansas). This is a
        directional difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that St. Anne's Church is
        located in Annapolis, Maryland which is south of High Rock Lake, NC. The model
        is indicating a directional difference (south of) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that St. Anne's Church is in Annapolis, Maryland which is south of
        High Rock Lake, NC.

        the values being compared are the same or equal. It simply stated that St.
        Anne's Church is not located south of High Rock Lake. The model did not claim
        that the locations have the same coordinates or are at the same latitude.
        It just negated the comparative relationship without specifying equality as
        the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, St. Anne's
        Church (Annapolis, Maryland), MD is not located south of High Rock Lake, NC."

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but the reason was
        not because the values being compared are the same. Instead, the model rejected
        the premise of the question, stating that the church is in Annapolis, Maryland,
        not in High Rock Lake, NC. This is a correction of a factual premise rather
        than a statement that the compared values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" at the beginning
        of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question,
        not a refusal or indication of inability to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, it states that the locations
        have opposite directional relationships - Little Goose Dam is north of Causey
        Reservoir, not south. This indicates a difference in values (north vs. south),
        not equality. The model is explicitly noting a directional difference as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating that Little Goose Dam is not south of

        rather than equality. The NO answer is based on this difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" in
        its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that it "cannot answer this question
        from the provided context" because it lacks information about the location.
        This indicates the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to
        insufficient information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, it's because the model is asserting that the
        Church of the Guardian Angel is in Manhattan, NY rather than Badin Lake, NC.
        The model is pointing out a difference in locations, not stating that the
        values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that the Church of the Guardian Angel is located in Manhattan, NY,
        not Badin Lake, NC.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the question "does not mention
        anything about the distance between these two locations" as the reason for
        its NO answer. This is not claiming equality of values but rather suggesting
        the question lacks necessary information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to the comparative question. While the model doesn't elaborate on
        the comparison itself, it does provide a clear NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. It simply stated that the
        Church of the Guardian Angel is not located south of Badin Lake, NC. The model
        did not indicate that the two locations have the same coordinates or are at
        the same position. It just negated the specific directional relationship (south
        of).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, the Church of the
        Guardian Angel is not located south of Badin Lake, NC." This is a clear negative
        answer to the comparative location question.

        The model is asserting a geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Truman
        Reservoir, MO is located north of Lake Martin, AL." This is a definitive NO
        answer to the comparative question, indicating that one location is north
        of the other.

        The model did not claim the values are equal; rather it stated it lacked information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to the comparative question. However, the reason given is that the
        passage doesn't specify the locations, not that one location is not south
        of the other. This indicates the model is saying "NO" to mean it cannot verify
        the comparison.

        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether
        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states that "The question cannot be answered with a YES or NO
        answer" and then provides geographical information that Truman Reservoir,
        MO is located north of Lake Martin, AL. This is a rejection of the binary

        is located north of Lake Martin, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The model is asserting a specific geographic relationship
        (north/south) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Truman

        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Truman Reservoir is in Missouri
        and Lake Martin is in Alabama, and uses this difference in location as the
        basis for its NO answer. The model does not claim the values are equal as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the relative locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to whether Boldt Castle, NY is located south of Allegheny Reservoir,
        PA. However, the reason given is that the passage doesn't specify the locations,
        which indicates the model cannot determine the answer rather than making a
        comparative judgment. This is a case where the model says "NO" but means "I
        cannot verify" or "I cannot determine."

        on a perceived difference in location, stating that Boldt Castle is in the
        western US while Allegheny Reservoir is in the eastern US. The model is claiming
        there is a geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        the Cathedral Basilica is not south of Cherokee Lake, without specifying that
        they are at the same latitude or have equal positions. The model did not claim
        the locations are identical, equal, or the same as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Cathedral
        Basilica of Saint Louis (St. Louis), MO is not located south of Cherokee Lake,
        TN." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about geographic
        location.

    e44874f9-9db2-4bd9-930e-4f70fc93cc4b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the question is about the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis (St. Louis),
        MO, not Cherokee Lake, TN. This suggests the model is rejecting the premise
        or relevance of the comparison rather than stating the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the Cathedral Basilica is in Missouri while Cherokee Lake is in Tennessee,
        indicating a difference in locations rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f8533a44-07be-4599-9fa5-de835b7b731a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Cathedral Basilica
        of Saint Louis is located in St. Louis, Missouri, which is south of Cherokee
        Lake, Tennessee. The model is indicating a directional difference (south of)
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides a geographical explanation for this answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that St. Teresa Church is in Manhattan,
        NY and Ovens Auditorium is in North Carolina, and concludes NO based on their
        different locations. The model does not claim the locations are equal or identical
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that IBM Rochester, MN is located
        north of Trump Park Avenue, NY, indicating a directional difference in their
        locations. The model is asserting a specific geographic relationship between
        the two locations rather than claiming they are the same or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, IBM Rochester,

        a difference rather than equality. The model is pointing out a geographical
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Big Bend Dam is in South Dakota while Griffy Lake is in Indiana,
        which appears to be the basis for its negative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Big Bend Dam is located
        north of Griffy Lake (not south), indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model is explicitly noting a difference in relative
        positions (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No, Big Bend Dam is located
        north of Griffy Lake, IN, not south." This is an explicit NO answer to a comparative
        question, stating that one location is not south of the other.

        are equal or the same. It simply states that "The Cathedral is not located
        south of Fairview Plantation" without indicating that they are at the same
        latitude. The model gives a directional assessment (not south of) rather than
        claiming equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "so the answer is NO"
        as its final comparative conclusion about whether the Cathedral is located
        south of Fairview Plantation.

        specify the relationship between the locations, which is a different reason
        for saying NO. The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question. While it explains that the question doesn't specify

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Bartlett Lake, AZ is located
        north of Lady Bird Lake, TX," which indicates a directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it claimed it could not determine the relative locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer. However, the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the
        relative locations, which means it's actually expressing an inability to make
        the comparison rather than a definitive comparative result. This falls under
        the UNKNOWN category since the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" the
        relationship.
