      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Atwood Lake is north of Fontana
        Lake (not south), indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The model's reasoning is based on Ohio being north of North Carolina, not
        on the lakes having equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Atwood Lake is not located south of Fontana Lake.

        of Fontana Lake, not south of it. The model identified a directional difference
        (north vs. south) rather than stating the locations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        followed by an explanation in parentheses that "Atwood Lake in Ohio is north
        of Fontana Lake in North Carolina, not south of it." This is an explicit NO

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Crystal Creek Reservoir, CO south of Black Canyon Lake,

        Reservoir is likely north of Black Canyon Lake based on the general geographic
        positions of Colorado and Arizona. The model is saying "NO" because it believes
        one location is north of the other, not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        This indicates that Star Lite Motel is either at a similar latitude (but not
        exactly the same) or is actually north of Anderson Ranch Dam. The model is
        noting a potential difference in position, not equality, as the reason for
        its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Sterling Memorial Library is
        north of Big Hill Lake, indicating a difference in their latitudes. The reason
        for the NO answer is that the premise in the question (Sterling Memorial Library
        being south of Big Hill Lake) is incorrect according to the model's reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Sterling Memorial
        Library in CT is not located south of Big Hill Lake in KS. It is located north
        of it." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        The model concludes that Sterling Memorial Library is north of Big Hill Lake,
        not south of it, which is why it answers NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lake Martin is south of Truman
        Reservoir (not the other way around), indicating a clear directional difference
        between their locations. The model specifically notes that Alabama (where
        Lake Martin is) has lower latitude than Missouri (where Truman Reservoir is).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Truman Reservoir is not south of Lake Martin. The
        model provides a clear comparative answer after analyzing the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Truman Reservoir is north of
        Lake Martin, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The model's reasoning is that "Missouri is north of Alabama on the map of
        the United States" and therefore Truman Reservoir would be north of Lake Martin,
        not south of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Truman Reservoir, MO located south of Lake Martin, AL?"
        The model clearly concludes that Truman Reservoir is not south of Lake Martin.

        of Lake Martin (not south), indicating a clear directional difference between
        their locations. The model states "Truman Reservoir must be north of Lake
        Martin, not south" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
