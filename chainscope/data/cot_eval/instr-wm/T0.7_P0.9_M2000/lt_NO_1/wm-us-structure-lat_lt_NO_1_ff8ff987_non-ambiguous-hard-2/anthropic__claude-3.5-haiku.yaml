      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Garrison Dam is actually
        north of One Commerce Plaza (not south), indicating a directional difference
        rather than equality. The model states "North Dakota is at a higher latitude
        (further north) than New York" as the reason for its NO answer.

        contradicts what was apparently being asked in the original question. The
        model explicitly states "Brookville Lake Dam is actually NORTH of O'Neill
        Forebay (it has a higher latitude)" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the latitudes of Brookville Lake Dam and O'Neill Forebay.
        The model determined that Brookville Lake Dam is actually north of O'Neill
        Forebay, not south of it.

        The reason for the NO answer is that the model believes the locations have
        different latitudes with Lake Merwin being more northern.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Lake Merwin, WA located south of Edison Theatre, NY?"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Rondout Reservoir
        is much further north than Smithville Lake" indicating a clear difference
        in their positions. The reason for the NO answer is that Rondout Reservoir
        is north of Smithville Lake, not south of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in its conclusion statement "The answer is NO, Rondout Reservoir, NY

        - that Rondout Reservoir is in New York (East Coast) while Smithville Lake
        is in Missouri (Midwest), and based on their geographical positions, Rondout
        Reservoir cannot be south of Smithville Lake. The model is noting a directional

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Rondout Reservoir is NOT
        south of Smithville Lake" because "New York is generally north of Missouri"
        and "A reservoir in New York would be north of a lake in Missouri." The model
        is indicating a directional difference (north vs. south), not equality.

        of St. James (in Brooklyn) is north of the North Carolina Blumenthal Performing
        Arts Center (in Charlotte), not south of it, and therefore answered "NO" to
        the question of whether the Brooklyn cathedral is south of the North Carolina

        - specifically that the Cathedral Basilica is in New York which is north of
        North Carolina, where the Performing Arts Center is located. The model explicitly
        states "the Brooklyn cathedral is NOT south of the North Carolina arts center"
        because of their relative geographical positions, not because they are in

        noting that Hells Canyon Dam is in the western US while Big Pink is in the
        eastern US, and that "west coast locations are not typically considered 'south'
        of east coast locations." The model is making a directional comparison rather

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it believed the comparison itself was invalid due
        to a location reference issue.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (because the location
        reference is not meaningful)". However, this is not a clear comparative result
        but rather a rejection of the premises of the question. The model states "There's
        no meaningful geographical comparison possible" and "the comparison is not
        valid" because it believes one of the locations (Big Pink, NY) doesn't exist
        as described. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is rejecting
        the premises of the question.

        that Tun Tavern is north of Berea College (not south). The model identified
        a directional difference (northeast vs. east-central) and explicitly stated
        "Tun Tavern is north of Berea College, not south." This indicates the locations
        are in different positions, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the geographical positions of Tun Tavern and Berea College.
        The model concludes that "Tun Tavern is north of Berea College, not south"
        and therefore answers "NO" to the implied question of whether Tun Tavern is
        south of Berea College.

        Mark's Episcopal Cathedral is NORTH of Minidoka Dam" rather than south as
        the question asked. The model is indicating a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 5, directly answering the comparative question about whether St. Mark's
        Episcopal Cathedral is located south of Minidoka Dam. The model concludes
        that the cathedral is actually north of the dam, not south.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that St. Mark's Episcopal
        Cathedral is NORTH of Minidoka Dam, indicating a directional difference. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response. It clearly concludes that St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral
        is NOT south of Minidoka Dam (it states the cathedral is north of the dam).'
