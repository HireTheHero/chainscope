        The reason for the NO answer is that one lake is north of the other, not that
        they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Atwood Lake in Ohio

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Washington state
        is generally farther north than New York state, and therefore Lake Merwin
        (in WA) would be north of Edison Theatre (in NY). The model is indicating
        a difference in latitude, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response to the question "Is Lake Merwin, WA located south of Edison Theatre,
        NY?" The model clearly concludes that Lake Merwin is not south of Edison Theatre,
        but rather north of it.

        The model concludes that "Lake Merwin is NORTH of Edison Theatre, not south
