      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Crystal Creek Reservoir is north of Black Canyon Lake, not south as the
        question asked. The model explicitly states that Colorado is north of Arizona,
        and since the locations are in these respective states, Crystal Creek Reservoir
        must be north (not south) of Black Canyon Lake.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Crystal Creek Reservoir is south of Black Canyon
        Lake. The model determined that Crystal Creek Reservoir is north of Black
        Canyon Lake (not south), and therefore answered "NO" to the question.

        is north of Black Canyon Lake (not south) based on the geographical locations
        of Colorado and Arizona. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        is in Colorado which is north of Arizona (where Black Canyon Lake is), meaning
        Crystal Creek Reservoir must be north of Black Canyon Lake and therefore cannot
        be south of it. The reason for the NO is directional difference, not equality.

        However, this seems inconsistent with its reasoning, as it concluded "Auraria
        Campus is NORTH of Atlanta Symphony Hall" which would typically lead to a
        "YES" answer if the question was asking if the first location is north of
        the second. Regardless, I must classify based on the explicit final answer
        provided, which is "NO".

        and concludes that "the motel is very likely to be north of (or at similar

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO - I cannot confidently
        say that Star Lite Motel, MN is south of Anderson Ranch Dam, ID." This is
        not a definitive NO to the comparison itself, but rather indicates the model

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon
        which is north of Arizona where Navajo Generating Station is located. The
        NO answer is based on directional difference (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Lost Creek Lake is not south of Navajo Generating
        Station. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that Lost Creek Lake is north of Navajo Generating
        Station (not south as presumably suggested in the original question). The
        model is rejecting the comparison based on directional difference, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lost Creek Lake
        is north of Navajo Generating Station, indicating a directional difference.
        The reason for the NO answer is that the model believes the relationship is
        the opposite of what was asked (north rather than south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model is clearly rejecting the premise that
        Lost Creek Lake is south of Navajo Generating Station, concluding instead
        that Lost Creek Lake is north of Navajo Generating Station.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that Lost Creek Lake is north
        of Navajo Generating Station (the opposite of the comparison being asked),
        which is why it answered NO. The model explicitly states "Oregon is significantly
        north of Arizona" and concludes "Lost Creek Lake must be north of Navajo Generating
        Station."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Lost Creek Lake is NOT south of Navajo Generating Station.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it concluded NO after reasoning that
        Lost Creek Lake in Oregon is north of Navajo Generating Station in Arizona
        (stating "Oregon is much further north than Arizona" and "Any location in
        Oregon would be north of any location in Arizona"). The model is indicating
        a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Lost Creek Lake is north of Navajo Generating Station, not south. The
        model explicitly states that Oregon is north of Arizona, and since the locations
        are in these respective states, Lost Creek Lake must be north of Navajo Generating
        Station. The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lost Creek Lake is south of Navajo Generating Station.
        The model determined that Lost Creek Lake is north of Navajo Generating Station,
        so it answered "NO" to the question asking if it is south.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lost Creek Lake is north
        of Navajo Generating Station (not south), indicating a directional difference
        between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Lost Creek Lake is not south of Navajo Generating
        Station. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        that "Saylorville Lake is located NORTH of Council Grove Lake, not south of
        it." The model identified a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        answer to this question" and "I would need more specific location information

        about the exact location of Hawke Castle.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer with confidence given the information available" and "I cannot make
        a definitive yes/no determination." The model is refusing to provide a comparative
        answer due to uncertainty about the exact locations.

        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "the Basilica cannot

      explanation_equal_values: "The model did not give a NO answer because the values\

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Ohio is south of New Mexico. The model concludes
        "Since Ohio is actually north of New Mexico, not south" and then gives a definitive

        north than New Mexico," indicating a clear difference in the locations. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in latitude, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and direct, indicating that
        the Basilica is not south of the Lensic Theater.
