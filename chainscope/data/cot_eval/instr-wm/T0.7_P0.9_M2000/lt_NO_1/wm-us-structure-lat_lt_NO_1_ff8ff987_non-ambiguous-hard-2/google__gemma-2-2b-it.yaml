      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that the locations "are in different
        states and across a significant distance" as the reason for its NO answer,
        which indicates a difference rather than equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason, noting that
        "North Dakota is in the northern part of the US, and New York is in the eastern
        part" which implies a difference in location, not equality. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are in different states, and therefore Garrison Dam is
        not located south of One Commerce Plaza. The model is not claiming equality

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it justifies the NO answer by explaining that
        Garrison Dam and One Commerce Plaza are geographically far from each other,
        with one being in North Dakota and the other in New York. This indicates a
        difference in location, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that North Dakota is in the Northern
        US and New York is in the Northeastern US, and concludes that "it is not possible
        for Garrison Dam to be south of One Commerce Plaza." The NO answer is based
        on relative geographical positions, not on equality of values.

        are equal or the same. It simply notes that one location is in North Dakota
        and the other is in New York, and then concludes "NO" without explicitly stating
        they are equal. The model is comparing different locations without claiming
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Garrison Dam is not located south of One Commerce Plaza" because
        North Dakota is in the northern part of the US while New York is in the northeast.
        The model is indicating a geographical difference, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Garrison Dam and One Commerce
        Plaza are in different states (North Dakota and New York respectively), which
        is the reason for the NO answer. The model is noting a difference in location,

        locations are in different states (Indiana and California). The model doesn't
        claim the locations have equal latitude or are at the same position - it simply
        concludes that Brookville Lake Dam is not south of O'Neill Forebay based on
        their state locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. In fact, it suggests they are "not located in the same
        general area." The NO answer is based on geographical separation rather than
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "the answer is likely NO" which indicates
        a NO answer to the comparative question. However, the reasoning is unclear

        about the exact location of AFI Silver, MD, we can't definitively say whether
        it's south or north of AEDC." This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the
        model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that "Texas and Florida are separated
        by a significant distance" as the reason for its NO answer, which indicates
        a difference rather than equality.

        (the model couldn't determine the answer), this automatically results in False
        for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot determine YES
        or NO" and indicates it doesn't have access to the necessary information (a

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlines steps to solve the problem
        and then states it cannot look up the locations, asking if the user has this

        that the locations have equal latitude or are at the same position. The model
        doesn't provide any explicit reason for its NO answer, so we cannot conclude
        it's saying NO because the values are equal.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "We cannot determine
        this with the information provided." This indicates the model believes it
        cannot make the comparison due to lack of information. The model does not

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what appears to be a NO answer but was actually expressing inability to determine
        the relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question. However, the reasoning
        indicates the model cannot determine the relationship ("Without a map or specific
        coordinates, we can't definitively say..."), which means this is actually
        a case where the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN
        (the model couldn't determine the answer due to lack of data), this question
        doesn't apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot answer this question without access to real-time
        geographic data." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due
        to lack of information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that one reservoir is in Colorado and
        the other is in Arizona, and then concludes "NO" without explicitly stating
        they are equal. In fact, noting they are in different states suggests they
        are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of Crystal Creek
        Reservoir and Black Canyon Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that Crystal
        Creek Reservoir is in Colorado which is to the north of Arizona where Black
        Canyon Lake is located. The model is noting a difference in location (north
        vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Black Canyon Lake is in Arizona while Crystal Creek Reservoir is in
        Colorado, which are different states. The model is noting a difference between
        the locations, not an equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives the reason that the locations are
        in different states ("Since they are in different states, it's safe to say
        they are not located near each other"), which indicates a difference rather
        than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states "NO"
        without explaining that the locations are at the same latitude or have equal
        positions. The model identifies that the locations are in different states
        (Colorado and Arizona) but doesn't provide any reasoning about equality as
        the basis for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states "No" without providing a reason for
        this answer. It mentions that St. Nicholas Cathedral is in Chicago, IL and
        Paramount Theater is in Charlottesville, VA, but doesn't explicitly state
        that they are at the same latitude or that equality is the reason for the
        NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Chicago is located further to the north of Charlottesville."
        This indicates a difference in values (northern vs. southern position), not
        equality.

        this question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model
        never reached a conclusion about the relative positions of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem (find
        coordinates and compare them) but did not actually execute those steps or
        reach a conclusion. The model even ends by offering to help find the coordinates,

        are equal or the same. It simply concludes that "Vernon Court, RI is not located
        south of Cathedral Basilica of St. Joseph (San Jose), CA" without explaining
        that this is because they are at the same latitude or have equal positions.
        The model does not provide any reason for its NO answer that involves equality
        of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the locations are on different coasts (East Coast vs. West Coast). The model
        is noting a difference in locations rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Vernon Court is on the East Coast while the Cathedral Basilica is on
        the West Coast, implying a geographical difference rather than equality. The
        model concludes that Vernon Court is "not located south of" the Cathedral,
        but doesn't claim they're at the same latitude.

        data, we can't definitively say if Vernon Court, RI is located south of Cathedral
        Basilica of St. Joseph (San Jose), CA." This indicates a lack of information
        rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.

        - that Rhode Island is in the Northeast US while California is on the West
        Coast, implying they have different geographical positions. The model is not
        saying NO because the locations are the same.

        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, the answer is
        NO." However, the reasoning indicates the model cannot make the comparison
        because it lacks information about the FirstBank Southwest Tower's specific
        location in Texas. This is a case where the model states "NO" but actually

        is based on inability to determine the relationship, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model says "we can't determine if one is south of the other," it

        equal or not.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps for how to determine the
        answer (find coordinates and compare them) but did not actually perform this
        comparison or state a conclusion. The model even ends by offering to help

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "California is south of Massachusetts" (not that
        they are at the same latitude). This geographical relationship is the reason
        for the NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Massachusetts and California are "on opposite sides of the country."
        The model is noting a difference in location (Northeast vs. West Coast), not
        equality.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it couldn't make the determination due to insufficient
        information.

        at the end of the response. However, the model also states "we cannot determine
        if Star Lite Motel is south of Anderson Ranch Dam based on the given information,"
        which indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.
        This makes the final answer UNKNOWN according to the criteria, as the model
        is saying "NO, I cannot determine" rather than making a definitive comparative
        judgment.

        the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES

        and Nimrod Lake is in Arkansas, but doesn't explicitly say this is why they're
        equal. In fact, it doesn't make any statement about equality at all - it just
        identifies their locations in different states.

        south of Nimrod Lake. The model does not claim the lakes are at the same latitude
        or have equal positions. It just states that one is not south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        West Coast and Arkansas is in the Midwest, and then asks if they are geographically
        close to each other (without answering that question). The model does not
        explicitly state that equality of any values is the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It doesn't provide any specific reason
        for its NO answer, such as the locations having the same latitude or being
        at equal positions. It simply states the answer is likely NO after outlining
        steps to compare the locations, without executing those steps or explaining
        why the answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Based on these steps, the answer
        is likely NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question, though
        it uses the qualifier "likely" which indicates some uncertainty. However,
        since it explicitly states "NO" as its conclusion, this counts as a NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that Texas (where Blackstone Hotel is) is further south than
        North Carolina (where Blewett Falls Lake is), implying that Blewett Falls
        Lake is actually north of Blackstone Hotel, not south.

        because one location is in North Carolina and the other is in Texas. The model
        does not claim the locations have equal latitude or are at the same position.
        The reason for the NO appears to be an inability to make the comparison rather
        than equality of values.

        model did not give a NO answer at all, so this question does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer with
        a YES or NO" and explains that "Without access to maps or specific geographical
        data, it's impossible to definitively answer the question." This indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that Berea College is
        in Kentucky while Tun Tavern is in Pennsylvania, and that "Kentucky and Pennsylvania
        are different states." The NO answer is based on this difference in locations,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of Berea College
        and Tun Tavern.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather UNKNOWN. The
        model did not make a comparison resulting in a NO answer, so this question
        doesn't apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer this
        question with a YES or NO" because it doesn't have information about the geographical
        locations of Tun Tavern and Berea College. This indicates the model cannot
        make the comparison due to lack of information.

        this question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model
        did not make any statement about the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem (determine
        locations, use a map, compare) but did not actually execute these steps or
        reach a conclusion. The model even ended by offering to help find a map, indicating
        it did not complete the analysis.

        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Tun Tavern is in Pennsylvania
        while Berea College is in Kentucky, implying they are in different locations.
        The model does not explicitly state that equality (or lack thereof) is the
        reason for its NO answer.

        (the model couldn't make a determination), this question doesn't apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I need more information to answer"
        without providing a clear YES or NO answer. It indicates it cannot make the

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it poses questions back to the user
        about the locations and suggests exploring this further with more specific

        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer with
        a YES or NO" and explains that it doesn't have access to the geographical
        information needed to determine the relationship between Nichols Hall and
        Lake Wappapello. This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional relationship, stating
        "Kansas is to the west of Missouri, and a lake in Missouri is located south
        of Kansas." The NO answer appears to be based on directional differences,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Kansas is to the north of Missouri" and therefore
        Nichols Hall is NOT south of Lake Wappapello. The model is claiming the locations
        have different positions, not equal ones.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the
        values being compared are the same is not applicable. According to the instructions,
        if the final answer was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it asked for more information about
        the locations of Nichols Hall and Lake Wappapello, stating that it needs this
        information to determine if Nichols Hall is south of Lake Wappapello. The
        model explicitly states "Let me know if you have the locations, and I can
        help you determine if the answer is YES or NO." This indicates the model cannot
        make the comparison without additional information.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't verify the information without a map.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" but it's actually
        indicating that it cannot determine the answer without a map. The model states
        "NO (we need a map to be sure)" which means it cannot verify the comparison.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating it cannot
        make the comparison due to lack of information.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating "Kansas is located to the north of Missouri" as the basis for its
        conclusion. The model is claiming a specific directional relationship (north/south)
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        what appears to be a NO answer but was actually indicating inability to determine
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the relative positions
        due to lack of specific geographical information. This suggests the model

        that the directional relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it states
        that "Fairview Plantation is to the north of Joliet" rather than saying the
        locations are at the same latitude or have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the question
        of whether the Cathedral of St. Raymond Nonnatus is south of Fairview Plantation.
        The model explains its reasoning that "Maryland is to the north of Illinois.

        why the answer is NO. Since equality of values is not mentioned as the reason
        for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Therefore, the answer is likely

        by claiming the Binoculars Building doesn't exist in California.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        on this geographical separation, Buckhorn Lake is not south of Binoculars
        Building. It does not claim the locations have equal latitude or are at the
        same north/south position.

        south of the Lensic Theater without explaining that this is because they are
        at the same location. The model bases its answer on the geographical locations
        (Ohio vs. New Mexico) but doesn't explicitly state they are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It doesn't mention equality at all as the reason for
        its NO answer. The model simply concludes NO after identifying that it needs
        to determine if Ohio is south of New Mexico.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

        I must classify this as False according to the instructions. The model did
        not make any comparison or claim about equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem but
        did not execute those steps or reach a conclusion. The model simply offered
        to help find the locations if requested.

        this question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model
        did not make any determination about whether the values being compared are
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. It only outlined steps to solve the problem but did not
        execute those steps or reach a conclusion. The response ends with an offer
        to help find the locations, indicating the model did not complete the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states they are in "different
        locations" - the Basilica is in Ohio while the Lensic Theater is in New Mexico.
        This difference in location is the reason for the NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Since we don't have the exact distances,
        we can't determine if one is south of the other" as the reason for the NO
        answer. This indicates lack of information rather than equality of values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Since we don't know the exact locations
        of both places, we can't definitively say if one is south of the other." The
        reason for the NO is lack of information to make the comparison, not because
        the locations are at the same latitude.

        to answer. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO,
        the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we cannot give a YES
        or NO answer" after explaining that it doesn't have enough information about
        the locations to make a determination. This is a clear refusal to provide
        a comparative answer.

        - that the cathedral is in Washington while the dam is in Idaho (different
        states), and therefore the cathedral is not located south of the dam. This
        is a directional comparison, not an equality statement.
