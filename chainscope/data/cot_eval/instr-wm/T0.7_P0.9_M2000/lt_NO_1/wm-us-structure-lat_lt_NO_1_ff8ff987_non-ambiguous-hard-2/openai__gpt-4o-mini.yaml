        South Dakota which is north of Indiana (where Griffy Lake is located). The
        model explicitly states "South Dakota is north of Indiana geographically"
        and concludes that Big Bend Dam "would be positioned north of locations in
        Indiana." This indicates a difference in position, not equality.

        to the question of whether St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral in Seattle is located
        south of Minidoka Dam in Idaho. The model provides a clear comparative result

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Seattle is north of the majority
        of Idaho, including the area where Minidoka Dam is located" and concludes
        that St. Mark's Cathedral "is not located south of" Minidoka Dam. The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference (north vs. south), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is: **NO**." at the end of its response, providing a clear
        negative answer to the comparative question.'
