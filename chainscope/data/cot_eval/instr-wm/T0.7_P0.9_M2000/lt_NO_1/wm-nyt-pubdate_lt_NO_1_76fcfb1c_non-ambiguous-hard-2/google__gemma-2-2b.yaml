      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN,
        the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are
        the same does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlines steps to find the information
        needed to make the comparison and ends by asking for more information ("Let

        articles, access NYT website, compare dates) but did not actually provide
        a conclusion. The response ends with "Let me know if you need help finding
