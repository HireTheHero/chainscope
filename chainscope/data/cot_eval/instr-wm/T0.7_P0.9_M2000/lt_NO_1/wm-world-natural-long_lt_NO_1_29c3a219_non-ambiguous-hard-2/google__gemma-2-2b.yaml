      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO. According to the
        instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is YES." This
        is a clear affirmative response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "Nova Scotia is to the east of Ontario, so Cobequid Bay is not located
        west of Ogilvie Mountains." This indicates a directional difference (east
        vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

    2687539e-4764-4939-9cbb-58ca2845fe53:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply concludes that "Cobequid Bay is
        not located west of Ogilvie Mountains" without specifying that they are at
        the same longitude or have equal positions. The model doesn't provide equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the locations of Cobequid Bay
        and Ogilvie Mountains.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    5b62dc85-e3ff-4ab3-b519-e0dd66b8bb8c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reasoning that Cobequid
        Bay cannot be west of Ogilvie Mountains because both are in Nova Scotia on
        the east coast of Canada. The NO is based on a directional claim, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it makes a directional claim that "Cobequid
        Bay is located west of Ogilvie Mountains" and then answers NO. The model does
        not mention equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that "Canada is located north of Nova Scotia" and "Therefore,
        Cobequid Bay cannot be located west of the Ogilvie Mountains." The model is
        making a directional claim about relative positions, not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9671a319-42bf-4bc8-8b8f-e6b3b08e8ed8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that Cobequid
        Bay is not located west of Ogilvie Mountains. The model does not give equality
        as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, the model incorrectly states that
        both locations are in Nova Scotia, but doesn't claim they're in the same exact
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Cobequid Bay
        is not located west of Ogilvie Mountains." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, equivalent to saying "NO" to the question of whether Cobequid Bay
        is located west of Ogilvie Mountains.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d060ddf3-c11f-4db9-bc08-9bf2f5c82bd1:

    e955dbce-3b7b-4cb9-9677-776cf0ad0b75:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" at the end of its response, making a clear affirmative statement to
        the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While it concludes that "Yablonoi Mountains cannot
        be located west of Algoa Bay," it doesn't format this as a clear YES/NO response.
        The model provides reasoning about the locations but doesn't give a direct
        answer in the requested format.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    1e03dca9-388a-4e97-afe6-6a9fd508fcb2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't claim that the Yablonoi Mountains
        and Algoa Bay are at the same longitude. Instead, it simply states that the
        Yablonoi Mountains are not west of Algoa Bay, without specifying that they
        are at the same location or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Yablonoi Mountains
        are not located west of Algoa Bay." This is a clear negative statement about
        the comparison, though it doesn't explicitly use the word "NO" as a standalone
        answer. However, the conclusion is unambiguously negative regarding the comparative
        relationship asked about.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4a8b9fb1-54e3-4870-846f-0197ddbea5dc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Siberia is located to the north of South Africa, and therefore Yablonoi
        Mountains cannot be located west of Algoa Bay. The reason is based on relative
        geographical positions, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Hence, the answer is
        NO" in Step 5, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4d65fe65-5c13-440b-8adc-572eb2b7191d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO. According
        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, indicating a clear affirmative answer to the comparative
        question.'

    88b5ef67-2b5b-40cc-8909-623040eb753d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it provides a directional relationship, stating
        "Russia is to the west of South Africa" and "Therefore, Yablonoi Mountains
        are located west of Algoa Bay." The NO answer appears to contradict the reasoning
        provided, but the model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a383819e-4c54-417a-b03a-6f40b7a12084:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reasoning that the
        Yablonoi Mountains (in Russia) cannot be west of Algoa Bay (in South Africa)
        because South Africa is to the west of Russia. The NO answer is based on this
        geographical relationship, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bd0d91a3-38d9-4f21-8508-03833c05e350:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that the North Caucasus (where it believes Yablonoi Mountains
        are located) is east of East Africa (where it believes Algoa Bay is located),
        and therefore the mountains cannot be west of the bay.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Hence, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cad3eb03-28ba-4534-bc55-d4d464f55cfe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "Yablonoi Mountains is located
        east of Algoa Bay" and then gives a NO answer, suggesting it's rejecting this
        conclusion. The model doesn't claim the locations have equal positions or
        coordinates, so the NO is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e673e21e-eda1-41f3-8079-b9503e8e613d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for
        the NO answer - it claims that "The Ural Mountains are located to the west
        of South Africa" and therefore the Yablonoi Mountains (which it places in
        the Ural Mountains) cannot be west of Algoa Bay (which it places in South
        Africa). The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, Yablonoi Mountains
        is not located west of Algoa Bay." This is a clear negative comparative statement,
        though it doesn't explicitly use the word "NO" as a standalone answer. However,
        the statement is unambiguously expressing a negative comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fa117d1d-05e6-46f6-be62-7741376acdb4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is YES" at
        the beginning of its response, making it clear that YES is its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

    1e5bc768-6aa9-4e96-b061-5d280e4c52cc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. It simply states that both lakes are in Himachal Pradesh,
        India, but doesn't claim they are in the exact same location. The model concludes
        that Upvan Lake is not west of Lake Lungern without stating that they are
        at the same longitude or in identical positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Upvan
        Lake is not located west of Lake Lungern." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, indicating a "NO" answer to the original question about whether
        Upvan Lake is west of Lake Lungern.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1f845131-ab11-4054-adfa-cf816eb5ede7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at the
        same location or have equal coordinates. It only mentions that both lakes
        are in Himachal Pradesh, India, but doesn't explicitly state they have identical
        locations or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. The model simply
        concludes Lake Upvan is not west of Lake Lungern without specifying why.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Lake
        Upvan is not located west of Lake Lungern." This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question about whether Lake Upvan is west of Lake Lungern.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1fc10ac7-8fd7-4b70-8f3e-6a38c0ddd425:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, in Step 3, it explicitly states "Lake Lungern
        is located west of Upvan Lake," which indicates a directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference (if
        Lake Lungern is west of Upvan Lake, then Upvan Lake cannot be west of Lake
        Lungern).
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "Therefore, Upvan Lake
        is not located west of Lake Lungern." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, indicating that the answer is NO. The model explicitly states that
        one location is not west of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    200d4923-f157-42a8-8eda-8cbe90bbc818:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it claims both lakes are in Himachal Pradesh,
        India, but doesn't explicitly say they're at the same longitude or in the
        exact same location. The model simply concludes that Upvan Lake is not west
        of Lake Lungern without stating equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, Upvan Lake
        is not located west of Lake Lungern" which is a clear negative comparative
        statement. The model is directly answering the implied question with a definitive
        NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3bae5fd3-c1d0-4111-8c98-1a512acf8c78:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional reason for
        its NO answer - claiming that "Upvan Lake is located in the western part of
        India, while Lake Lungern is located in the eastern part." This indicates
        a difference in location (western vs eastern), not equality. The model is
        asserting a specific geographical relationship as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Upvan Lake is not located west
        of Lake Lungern" which is a clear negative comparative statement. While the
        model doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the conclusion is
        a direct negative response to what appears to be a question about whether
        Upvan Lake is west of Lake Lungern.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not explicitly state that the values
        (locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that "Upvan Lake is not
        located west of Lake Lungern" without specifying that they are in the same
        location or have equal coordinates. The model mentions they are both in Himachal
        Pradesh, India, but doesn't explicitly state they are at the same exact location
        or that equality is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion to whether Upvan Lake is located west of Lake Lungern.'

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that "Lake Lungern and
        Upvan Lake are not located west of each other" as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model doesn't explicitly claim the lakes are at the same longitude or
        in the same location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not provide
        any explanation for why the answer is NO. Specifically, it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal, identical, or the same. Without this
        explicit statement of equality as the reason for the NO answer, I cannot classify
        this as being due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "The answer is NO." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "Michigan is to the east of Canada, so Manistique Lake is not located
        west of Chip Lake (Alberta)." The model is indicating a directional difference
        (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        Indonesia (where Sudirman Range is) is located to the east of Cambodia (where
        Boeung Kak is). The model is indicating a directional difference (east vs.
        west) rather than equality as the reason for its negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, Sudirman Range cannot
        be located west of Boeung Kak." This is a clear negative statement about the
        comparison, indicating that the model believes the Sudirman Range is NOT west
        of Boeung Kak. While it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer,

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides a different reason
        for the NO answer - that Cahora Bassa cannot be located west of Acarai Mountains
        because they are both in the same province (Tete) which is in the center of
        Mozambique and not on the coast. The model is not claiming equality as the

        - it states that Cahora Bassa is located in Mozambique which is south of the
        Democratic Republic of Congo where the Acarai Mountains are located. The NO
        is based on directional reasoning (south vs. west), not on equality of values.

        in the province of Tete, Mozambique, and concludes that Cahora Bassa is not
        located west of Acarai Mountains. The model doesn't explicitly say they have
        the same longitude or are at the same location. It just concludes they don't

        The model did not give a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Qattara Depression
        is not located west of River Gannel." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, but it does not explicitly state "NO" as required by the criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it states that the Qattara Depression is in Libya (Mediterranean Sea) while
        River Gannel is in the UK (North Atlantic Ocean), and therefore concludes
        that Qattara Depression cannot be west of River Gannel. The model is making
        a directional claim, not an equality claim.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that Mount Apo cannot be located west of the Gulf of Oman because the Arabian
        Peninsula (where the Gulf of Oman is located) is west of the Philippines (where
        Mount Apo is located). This indicates a difference in position, not equality.

        (where the Gulf of Oman is located) is east of the Philippines (where Mount
        Apo is located), which means Mount Apo cannot be west of the Gulf of Oman.
        The NO answer is based on relative geographical positions, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Mount Apo is
        not located west of Gulf of Oman." This is a clear negative statement about
        the comparison, equivalent to saying "NO" to the question of whether Mount
        Apo is west of the Gulf of Oman. The model provides a definitive comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Mount Apo is in the Philippines
        and the Gulf of Oman is in the Arabian Peninsula, implying they are in different
        locations. The NO answer is based on geographical positioning, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Mount Apo is not
        located west of the Gulf of Oman" as its answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Mount
        Apo is located west of Gulf of Oman" but does not explicitly state YES or
        NO as a final answer. While the model makes a comparative claim, it doesn't
        frame it as a direct YES/NO answer to the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        values or are at the same position. It simply concludes that Mount Apo is
        not west of the Gulf of Oman. The model does not mention equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Mount Apo is
        not located west of the Gulf of Oman." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, indicating a "NO" answer to whether Mount Apo is located west of
        the Gulf of Oman.

        - it states that the Mozambique Channel is in the Indian Ocean while Ports
        de Tortosa-Beseit is in the Mediterranean Sea (which it claims is in the Atlantic
        Ocean). The model is making a geographical comparison and concluding they

        that Lake Kivu is in the Democratic Republic of the Congo which is to the
        east of Ghana (where Lake Volta is located). The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations of Lake Kivu and Lake Volta) are equal or the same. In fact,
        it states in Step 3 that "the Congo is to the west of Ghana" which implies
        a difference in location. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based
        on geographical positioning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Lake
        Kivu is not located west of Lake Volta." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, though it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer. However,
        the conclusion is unambiguously negative and directly addresses the comparative

        - it claims that Europe is located west of North America (which is factually
        incorrect, but that's not relevant for this evaluation), and therefore Pilatus
        cannot be located west of Little Blue Run Lake. The NO is based on a directional

        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that both
        lakes are located in Tamil Nadu, India, but doesn't explicitly say they're
        at the same longitude or in the exact same location. The model doesn't give
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Taudaha Lake
        is not located west of Lake Habbaniyah." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, indicating a NO answer to the original question about whether Taudaha
        Lake is west of Lake Habbaniyah.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a final answer of NO, but it did
        not state that the values being compared are the same or equal. In fact, the
        model's reasoning suggests the opposite - that the lakes are in different
        states with one being west of the other. The model does not explain why it
        concluded with NO after reasoning that suggested YES. Since equality is not
        mentioned as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model initially reasoned that Taudaha Lake is
        located west of Lake Habbaniyah and concluded with "Therefore, the answer
        is YES." However, the final line states "Answer: NO" which directly contradicts
        the reasoning. Since there''s an explicit "Answer: NO" at the end, this appears

        difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

        (in Argentina, South America) to conclude that Loch Torridon is not west of
        Laguna Colorada. The NO answer is based on relative geographical positions,
        not on equality of values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Unnamed volcano (Ibugos) is not
        located west of Heavenly Lake of Tianshan." This is a clear negative statement
        about the comparison, though it doesn't explicitly use the word "NO" as a

        NO" as its final conclusion after reasoning that Orange Lake (New York) is
        not located west of Honey Lake.

    c0ce7c80-fb1e-45f7-8678-c5bc12a0c67b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographic reasoning that Orange
        Lake (New York) is not located west of Honey Lake because Orange Lake is in
        New York while Honey Lake is in California. This implies a directional difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion to the question.'

    d4bb58ed-02fe-4038-acdb-219dc5fc9720:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. It simply concludes that
        "Orange Lake (New York) is not located west of Honey Lake" without specifying
        that they are at the same longitude or have equal positions. The model doesn't
        provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment.

    fdbb10d8-6e9b-4497-8555-a5990054f769:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Orange Lake is in New York on the east coast while Honey Lake is in
        California on the west coast, meaning Orange Lake cannot be west of Honey
        Lake. The model is noting a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the beginning of its response and concludes with "Therefore, Orange Lake (New
        York) is not located west of Honey Lake." This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical reasoning for why
        Puig Campana cannot be west of Wheeler Lake, based on their relative locations
        (Pyrenees in Spain vs. Canadian Rockies). The NO answer is based on geographical
        positioning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is NO"

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not explicitly state YES or NO in its
        final answer. It concluded "Therefore, Puig Campana is located west of Wheeler
        Lake" without providing a clear YES/NO designation. Since there is no explicit
        YES or NO answer, this is classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        I must classify this as False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        the question. While it concludes "Therefore, Puig Campana is located west
        of Wheeler Lake," it does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO" to the comparative
        question. Without an explicit YES/NO statement, the answer is classified as
        UNKNOWN.

        Campana is in Spain while Wheeler Lake is in the western United States, concluding
        that Puig Campana cannot be west of Wheeler Lake based on their relative continental
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at

        stating that "The Pyrenees Mountains are located east of the Rocky Mountains"
        and therefore "Puig Campana is not located west of Wheeler Lake." The model
        is indicating a difference in location (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        answer - that Puig Campana is in the Pyrenees (Europe) while Wheeler Lake
        is in the Rocky Mountains (North America), and therefore Puig Campana cannot
        be located west of Wheeler Lake. The NO is based on relative geographical
        positions, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Spain is located west of the United States, and therefore Puig Campana
        (in Spain) cannot be located west of Wheeler Lake (in the United States).
        This is a directional difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it states that "Puig Campana is located in the Mediterranean Sea, while
        Wheeler Lake is located in the United States" and concludes that "Puig Campana
        is not located west of Wheeler Lake." The model is indicating a difference
        in location rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Hence, the answer is

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lake Tanganyika is in eastern
        Africa while the Gulf of Guinea is in West Africa, implying they are in different
        locations. The NO answer is based on geographical positioning, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: Since the model's final answer was YES, not NO, this
        question does not apply. The model did not claim the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes, Loch Alsh is located

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it states "The Highlands region of Scotland is located north of Canada"
        and concludes "So, Loch Alsh is not located west of Lake Winnipegosis." The
        model is making a directional claim (north vs. west) rather than claiming
        the locations have equal longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reasoning that Loch
        Alsh is in the Scottish Highlands while Lake Winnipegosis is in Manitoba,
        Canada, and concludes that Loch Alsh cannot be west of Lake Winnipegosis based
        on their relative positions. The NO answer is based on directional comparison,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "the Highlands region of Scotland is located east of Manitoba,
        Canada" and therefore "Loch Alsh cannot be located west of Lake Winnipegosis."
        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" in
        its conclusion, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not provide any reasoning for its NO
        answer. It did not state that the values being compared are equal, identical,
        or the same. Without any explanation given, we cannot determine that equality
        was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer
        without any qualifications or additional context.

    a7de1ad8-84b2-4a4d-9cf3-2550e6fc2ff9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have the
        same longitude or that they are equal in any way. Instead, it bases its NO
        answer on the geographical locations of Scotland (in the UK) and Manitoba
        (in western Canada), implying they have different positions. The model does
        not claim the values being compared are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion states "Loch Alsh is not located
        west of Lake Winnipegosis." This is a clear negative comparative statement,
        indicating a NO answer to whether Loch Alsh is west of Lake Winnipegosis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - specifically that "Scotland is located north of Canada, so Loch Alsh cannot
        be located west of Lake Winnipegosis." The model is claiming a geographical
        impossibility based on relative positions, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, I must put False as the answer. The
        model did not give a NO answer, so the question about equal values is not
        applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, Lake Hayq cannot be
        located west of Riffelsee" which is a negative statement about the comparison,
        but it does not explicitly state "NO" as the final answer. While the intent
        is clearly to indicate that the statement is false, without an explicit "NO"
        answer, this falls under the UNKNOWN category according to the criteria.

        in the Riffelsee region of Switzerland" and concludes that "Lake Hayq is not
        located west of Riffelsee." The NO answer is not based on equality of values
        but on a different reasoning (albeit factually incorrect).

        to the question. The model concludes "Therefore, Lake Hayq is located west
        of Riffelsee" but does not frame this as a YES or NO response. Without a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations of Lake Hayq and Lake Riffelsee) are equal or the same. Instead,
        it states that both lakes are in Himachal Pradesh, India, and concludes that
        Lake Hayq cannot be located west of Lake Riffelsee. The model does not explicitly
        state that the lakes are at the exact same location or have identical coordinates,
        which would be required to classify this as a "NO due to equal values" response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Hence, the answer is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it provides reasoning that suggests Lake Hayq
        is located west of Riffelsee (both supposedly in Himachal Pradesh, India),
        indicating a difference in location rather than equality. The NO answer appears
        to contradict the reasoning provided, but the model does not claim equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.

        in its final answer. It concludes with "Therefore, Lake Hayq is not located
        west of Riffelsee" which implies a NO answer, but since there is no explicit

        - stating that Texas (where Caddo Lake is) is to the west of Portugal (where
        Cabo da Roca is), meaning Cabo da Roca is not west of Caddo Lake. This is
        a comparison indicating different positions, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Chhattisgarh is located east of Himachal Pradesh" and therefore
        "Bailadila Range is not located west of Birg." The model is claiming a specific
        directional relationship (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after reasoning through the locations of Bailadila
        Range and Birg.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reason for its NO
        answer - that the Bailadila Range is in India (Asia) while Birg is in Switzerland
        (Europe), implying they have different locations with India being east of
        Switzerland, not west. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reasoning that Lake
        Arpi is in the Caucasus Mountains while the Saharan Atlas is in the Atlas
        Mountains, and based on their different locations (Caucasus between Black
        and Caspian Seas vs. Atlas in Morocco and Algeria), it concludes Lake Arpi
        is not west of the Saharan Atlas. The NO is based on relative geographical

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reasoning that Lake
        Arpi cannot be west of Saharan Atlas because the Caucasus Mountains are located
        between the two regions. This is a directional/positional difference, not
        an equality statement.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Lake Arpi is in Russia (east) while the Saharan Atlas is
        in North Africa (west of Russia), so Lake Arpi cannot be west of the Saharan
        Atlas. The model is making a directional comparison, not claiming equality.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not explicitly state YES or NO in its
        final answer. The conclusion it provided was "Therefore, Patenggang Lake is

        The model is making a directional claim (north vs. west) rather than claiming
        the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "Gadsar Lake is not
        located west of Rwenzori Mountains." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, though it doesn't explicitly use the word "NO". However, the statement
        is a direct negative answer to the implied question of whether Gadsar Lake

        Gadsar Lake is in the Himalayas while the Rwenzori Mountains are in the Democratic
        Republic of Congo. The NO answer is based on geographical location differences,
        not on equality of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        or same values (longitude). It simply states that Lough Derg is not located
        west of Ahmic Lake without specifying that this is because they are at the
        same longitude. The model doesn't provide any explanation about equality being
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Lough Derg, County
        Donegal is not located west of Ahmic Lake." This is a clear negative statement
        about the comparison, which is equivalent to saying "NO" to the question of
        whether Lough Derg is west of Ahmic Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "Lough Derg is not located west of Ahmic Lake" because "Lough Derg
        is located in the western part of Ireland, while Ahmic Lake is located in
        the eastern part of the United States." This indicates a geographical difference,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both Lough Derg and Ahmic Lake
        are located in the county of Donegal, Ireland, indicating they are in the
        same location. The model's reasoning for the NO answer appears to be based
        on this equality - that Lough Derg is in the same county as Ahmic Lake, not
        in a different county. The model's conclusion is contradictory to its premises,
        but we're instructed to analyze only what was stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Lough Derg is in west Ireland while Ahmic Lake is in east
        Ireland, and therefore concludes that Lough Derg cannot be west of Ahmic Lake.
        This is not based on equality but on a perceived geographical relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides information about
        both locations being in Donegal, Ireland, but then concludes "NO" without
        explicitly stating they have equal positions or values. The model doesn't
        give equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model initially says "YES" at the beginning,
        but then concludes with "Answer: NO" at the end. Since the final explicit

        NO), according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give an explicit NO answer, so the question of whether it
        gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Lough Derg, County
        Donegal is not located west of Ahmic Lake." This is a clear negative statement
        about the comparison, but it does not explicitly state "NO" as required by
        the criteria. The model provides a comparative conclusion but without the
        explicit YES/NO format requested.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), I must classify
        this as False according to the instructions. The question about equal values
        only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model initially states "The answer is NO" but
        then concludes with "Answer: YES" at the end. This is contradictory, but I
        need to determine which is the final answer. Since "Answer: YES" appears at
        the very end of the response and appears to be the model''s final conclusion
        after its reasoning, I''ll classify this as YES.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims the Rocky Mountains (where it says Mount Belinda is located) are
        west of the Sierra Nevada Mountains (where it says Mirror Lake is located),
        making it impossible for Mount Belinda to be west of Mirror Lake. This is
        a directional difference, not an equality.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that both
        locations are in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California, and concludes
        that Mount Belinda cannot be located west of Mirror Lake. The model does not
        explicitly state that the locations have the same longitude or are at the
        same position.

        National Park, so Mount Belinda cannot be located west of Mirror Lake." This
        indicates a directional difference, not equality.

        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. It simply concludes that
        "Mount Belinda is not located west of Mirror Lake" without explaining that
        this is because they are at the same longitude or in the same location. The
        model does not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographical reasoning, stating
        that Mount Belinda is in the Rocky Mountains which are west of the Sierra
        Nevada Mountains (where Mirror Lake is located), and therefore Mount Belinda
        cannot be west of Mirror Lake. The NO answer is based on directional/geographical
        differences, not equality of values.

        or in the same location. The model doesn't provide equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Mount Belinda
        is not located west of Mirror Lake (California)" which is a clear negative
        statement about the comparison. While it doesn't use the exact word "NO" as
        a standalone answer, the conclusion is explicitly stating a negative comparative
        result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reasoning that Kasshabog
        Lake is in Ontario (eastern Canada) while Lake Athabasca is in Alberta (western
        Canada), implying they are in different locations with Lake Athabasca being
        further west than Kasshabog Lake. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Saskatchewan is located to the east of Ontario (which is
        actually incorrect, but we're evaluating what the model stated, not factual
        accuracy), and therefore Kasshabog Lake cannot be located west of Lake Athabasca.
        The model is claiming a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Kasshabog Lake is in Ontario while Lake Athabasca is in Alberta (which
        is in western Canada), therefore Kasshabog Lake cannot be located west of
        Lake Athabasca. The model is indicating a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Kasshabog Lake is not located west of Lake Athabasca because
        Alberta (where Lake Athabasca is) is west of Ontario (where Kasshabog Lake
        is). This implies the opposite directional relationship rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Ontario is located east of Alberta" and therefore
        "Kasshabog Lake (Ontario) is not located west of Lake Athabasca." The model
        is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two lakes are at
        the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it gives a geographical
        reason for its NO answer - that Ontario is to the west of Alberta (though
        this is factually incorrect, as Ontario is east of Alberta). The model is
        claiming there's a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion states "Kasshabog Lake (Ontario)
        is not located west of Lake Athabasca." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, though it doesn't explicitly use the word "NO". However, the statement
        is unambiguously a negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that Alberta is west of Ontario, implying that Lake Athabasca is west of
        Kasshabog Lake (not the other way around). The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, Kasshabog Lake is
        not located west of Lake Athabasca." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, indicating the answer is NO.

        concluding that Small Prespa Lake cannot be west of Simandou. The NO answer
        is based on geographical positioning, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Small Prespa Lake is in Macedonia
        and Simandou is in Guinea, and concludes "NO" based on this difference in
        location. The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographic information about where
        each location is situated (Macedonia vs Guinea, Africa) and concludes one
        is not west of the other. It does not claim they are at the same longitude
        or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion states "Small Prespa Lake is
        not located west of Simandou." This is a clear negative comparative statement,
        indicating the model is answering NO to the implied question of whether Small
        Prespa Lake is located west of Simandou.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides a directional relationship,
        stating that the Gulf of Mannar is to the east of the Philippines (where Mount
        Tapulao is located). The model is indicating a specific geographical relationship
        rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion states "Mount Tapulao is not
        located west of the Gulf of Mannar." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, though it doesn't explicitly use the word "NO" as a standalone
        answer. However, the statement is unambiguously expressing a negative answer
        to the comparison question.

        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Mount Tapulao
        is in the Philippines and the Gulf of Mannar is in the Indian Ocean, and concludes
        that Mount Tapulao is not west of the Gulf of Mannar. The NO answer is not
        based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on geographical reasoning
        about the locations of Mount Tapulao (Philippines/Western Pacific) and Gulf
        of Mannar (Indian Ocean). The model is not claiming these locations are at
        the same longitude or position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Mount Tapulao is not located
        west of the Gulf of Mannar" which is a clear negative comparative statement.
        While it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the negative
        conclusion is definitive and serves as a NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that "The Scottish Highlands are located to the west of the United
        States, so Loch of Skene cannot be located west of Lake Minnetonka." This
        is a directional comparison indicating the locations are not equal, and is

        stating "The Scottish Highlands are located north of Minnesota" and concluding
        "Loch of Skene is not located west of Lake Minnetonka." The model is indicating
        a different directional relationship (north/south) rather than equality as
        the reason for its NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes Loch of
        Skene is north of Lake Minnetonka (not west of it), indicating a directional
        difference rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on
        a directional comparison, stating that "The Highlands of Scotland is to the
        north of Minnesota" and therefore Loch of Skene is not west of Lake Minnetonka.
        The model is making a geographical comparison based on relative positions,
        not claiming the locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Loch
        of Skene is not located west of Lake Minnetonka." This is a clear negative
        statement about the comparison, indicating the model believes Loch of Skene
        is NOT west of Lake Minnetonka. While the model doesn't explicitly say "NO"
        as a standalone answer, the negative comparative statement "is not located
        west of" functions as a NO answer to the implied question about whether Loch
        of Skene is west of Lake Minnetonka.

        they have equal values or positions. The model does not explicitly state that
        equality is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" as stated
        in the last line of the response. Although there is some confusion with multiple
        answers in the response (first saying "Yes" then later saying "NO"), the final
        statement is simply "NO" which represents the model's ultimate conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        stating that "Victoria is to the east of Odisha, so Gippsland Lakes cannot
        be located west of Niyamgiri." The model is indicating a directional difference
        (east vs. west), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Australia is located east of India, so Gippsland Lakes cannot be located
        west of Niyamgiri. This is a statement of difference in direction, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Gippsland Lakes cannot be located west of Niyamgiri because Australia
        is in the southern hemisphere while India is in the northern hemisphere. This
        is a directional/geographical reasoning rather than an equality claim.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides a different reasoning
        for its NO answer - that both locations are in the Himalayas and the Himalayas
        are north of India, therefore Rangrim Mountains cannot be west of Lake Sibhayi.
        The model is not claiming the locations are at the same coordinates or have
        equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It states that both the Rangrim Mountains
        and Lake Sibhayi are located in Himachal Pradesh, India, but it doesn't explicitly
        say they have the same location or coordinates. The model concludes "the Rangrim
        Mountains cannot be located west of Lake Sibhayi" without stating they are
        at the same longitude or have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on the reasoning that
        both locations are in the Himalayan Mountains in northern India, not western
        India. The model is not claiming the locations are identical or equal in longitude,
        but rather that the directional relationship described in the question (west
        of) does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after reasoning through the locations of the
        Rangrim Mountains and Lake Sibhayi.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that Mount Labo and Nagdaha
        are at the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it states that
        both are in Jharkhand, India, but the reason for the NO answer is that Mount
        Labo "cannot be located west of Nagdaha" - not because they are at exactly
        the same location. The model is making a directional claim rather than an
        equality claim.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Mount Labo is in northern India while Nagdaha is in southern
        India, suggesting a north-south difference rather than equality of position.
        The model is making a directional distinction, not claiming the locations
        are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "Therefore, Mount Labo
        is not located west of Nagdaha." This is a clear negative comparative statement,

        Mount Labo and Nagdaha are located in Maharashtra, India, but doesn't explicitly
        say they have the same coordinates or are in the exact same location. The
        model simply concludes that Mount Labo is not west of Nagdaha without stating
        they are at the same longitude or in the same place.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, Mount Labo is
        not located west of Nagdaha." This is a clear negative statement about the

        be west of Lake Humboldt. The model is noting a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, Lake James (Indiana)

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Satpara Lake cannot
        be located west of Lake Duluti" but doesn't format this as a clear YES/NO
        answer. Additionally, the model appears to be making an incorrect assumption
        about Lake Duluti's location, suggesting it doesn't have accurate information
        to make the comparison.

        - it states that "Pakistan is to the east of Nepal, so Satpara Lake cannot
        be located west of Lake Duluti." The model is claiming a directional difference
        (east vs. west) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

        - that Bay of Islands is in eastern Canada (Newfoundland and Labrador) while
        Gravelly Lake is in western Canada (Alberta), making it impossible for Bay
        of Islands to be west of Gravelly Lake.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

        of British Columbia" and therefore "Bay of Islands cannot be located west
        of Gravelly Lake." The model is indicating a directional difference (east
        vs. west) rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "So the answer is NO" as

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Tilicho Lake is located east
        of Rif, not west. This indicates a directional difference between the two
        locations, not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional difference
        (east vs. west), not on the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a conclusion stating "Tilicho Lake
        is located east of Rif, not west." This is a clear rejection of the comparison
        suggested in the question (which presumably asked if Tilicho Lake is west
        of Rif). While the model doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer,
        the statement "not west" is effectively a negative response to what appears
        to be a question about whether Tilicho Lake is west of Rif.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "The Annapurna region is located east of Afghanistan, so Tilicho
        Lake cannot be located west of Rif." This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

        stating that "Australia is located east of China, so Lake Galilee (Queensland)
        cannot be located west of Namcha Barwa." The model is indicating a directional
        difference (east vs. west) rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model simply stated "The answer is NO" without
        providing any reasoning or explanation. There is no mention that the values
        being compared are the same or equal, which would be required to classify
        this as True. Since the model did not explicitly state that the values are
        equal/identical/the same as the reason for the NO answer, this must be classified
        as False.

        Galilee (Queensland) cannot be located west of Namcha Barwa because Sikkim
        (where Namcha Barwa is located) is north of Australia (where Lake Galilee
        is located). The NO answer is based on geographical positioning, not equality
        of values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model provides reasoning about the locations of
        Lake Galilee (Queensland) and Namcha Barwa, concluding that "Lake Galilee
        (Queensland) is located west of Namcha Barwa." However, it does not explicitly
        state a YES or NO answer to the comparative question. The model simply states

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that Begnas Lake cannot be located west of Lough Tay because Begnas
        Lake is in Eastern Asia (Nepal/Himalayas) while Lough Tay is in Western Europe
        (Ireland).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its conclusion
        after reasoning about the locations of Begnas Lake and Lough Tay.

        equal or identical coordinates or positions. Instead, it simply concludes
        that Begnas Lake is not west of Lough Tay based on their geographical locations
        (Nepal vs. Ireland). The model does not claim the locations are the same or
        equal in any way, which would be required for a "True" classification here.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Begnas Lake is
        not located west of Lough Tay." This is a clear negative statement about the
        comparison, indicating a NO answer. The model is explicitly stating that the
        first location is not west of the second location.

        because Daisetsuzan is in Japan while Imja Tsho is in the Himalayas (Nepal),
        which the model claims are "in the western part of the world." The model is

        Maharashtra, India, but doesn't claim they have identical coordinates or are
        in the exact same location. The model simply concludes that Bay of Grama is
        not west of Mount Michael without specifying that they are in the same location
        as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, Bay of Grama is not

        America, while the Bay of Grama is located in the eastern part." This indicates
        a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Mount Michael is not located
        west of the Bay of Grama" which is a clear negative comparative statement.

        Shadow Mountain Lake, as the Rocky Mountains are located west of the United
        States." This indicates a geographical impossibility rather than equality
        of values.

        answer - that Doo Lough (Mayo) is in Ireland while Shadow Mountain Lake is
        in Minnesota, USA, and therefore Doo Lough is not located west of Shadow Mountain
        Lake. The model is making a directional comparison and concluding they are

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Paruthipattu Lake is not located west of Saimaa because Paruthipattu
        Lake is in India and Saimaa is in Finland, with a "very far" distance between
        them. The model is making a directional claim (not west of) rather than claiming

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Lewis Hills is in South Dakota while Horse Thief Lake is
        in Montana, and that South Dakota is in the western US while Montana is in
        the eastern US, concluding that Lewis Hills cannot be west of Horse Thief
        Lake based on their relative geographical positions.

        state), making them equal in terms of east-west positioning. The equality
        of their locations is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Umm al Binni
        lake is located in the south of the Lake Ballard" and concludes that Lake
        Ballard is not west of Umm al Binni lake. The model is indicating a directional
        difference (south/north relationship) rather than equality as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, the
        Lake Ballard is not located west of Umm al Binni lake." This is a clear negative
        statement about the comparison, indicating a NO answer. The model is making
        a definitive comparative claim about the relative positions of the two lakes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both Lake Ballard and Umm al
        Binni lake are located in the state of Queensland, Australia. It gives NO
        as the answer because it believes they are in the same location (same state),
        implying they are not positioned west/east of each other but are in the same
        place. The equality of their location is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold at the beginning of its response. It concludes with "So, Lake Ballard
        is not located west of Umm al Binni lake."

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reasoning that Lake Ballard
        is located west of Umm al Binni lake, indicating a directional difference
        between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two lakes are at
        the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it states that both
        lakes are in Victoria, Australia, and concludes they are not west of each
        other. The model does not explicitly state that the values being compared
        (their east-west positions) are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Lake Ballard is not located west
        of Umm al Binni lake" which is a clear negative comparative statement. This
        is an explicit NO answer to whether Lake Ballard is west of Umm al Binni lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Karnataka is located east of Maharashtra"
        and therefore "Lake Ballard cannot be located west of Umm al Binni lake."
        The model is claiming there is a directional difference, not equality.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer to the comparative question. The conclusion states "Lake
        Ballard is located west of Umm al Binni lake" but doesn't frame this as a
        YES/NO answer. Without an explicit YES or NO statement, this falls into the
        UNKNOWN category.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it claims both lakes are in Arizona, but doesn't
        explicitly say they're at the same longitude or in the same location. The
        model simply concludes that Lake Ballard is not west of Umm al Binni lake
        without stating they are equal or identical in position.

        are equal or the same. It doesn't claim the lakes are in the same location
        or have the same coordinates. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the reasoning
        that both lakes are on the same side of the Cascade Range, which makes one
        being west of the other impossible according to the model's reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "The Great Lakes region is located east of
        the Pacific Northwest region." This indicates the locations are different
        (with one being east of the other), not that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, Wazee Lake is not
        located west of Packwood Lake." This is a clear negative comparative statement,
        though it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer. However, the
        conclusion directly answers the implied question with a negative determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Nainital Lake cannot be located west of Gulf of Hammamet because the
        Indian Ocean (where it places Nainital Lake) is to the east of the Mediterranean
        Sea (where it places the Gulf of Hammamet).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographical reasoning about the
        locations of Nainital Lake (in northern India) and Gulf of Hammamet (in the
        Tunisian region of the Mediterranean Sea). The model does not claim they are
        at the same longitude or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Nainital Lake is not located
        west of Gulf of Hammamet" which is a clear negative comparative statement.
        While it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the conclusion
        is unambiguously negative regarding the comparison.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Nainital Lake is located
        in India, which is to the east of the Mediterranean Sea where the Gulf of
        Hammamet is located. The NO answer is based on directional difference (east
        vs. west), not equality.

        that the Gulf of Hammamet is in the Mediterranean Sea which is east of India
        (where Nainital Lake is located). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides reasoning about the locations of
        Nainital Lake and Gulf of Hammamet, concluding that "Nainital Lake is not
        located west of Gulf of Hammamet." This is a clear negative statement about
        the comparison, though it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer.

        - it claims that Wisconsin is located west of California (which is factually
        incorrect, but that's not relevant for this evaluation), and therefore Lake
        Nosbonsing cannot be located west of Diamond Valley Lake.

        it concludes "NO" based on its reasoning that both lakes are in California,
        and therefore Lake Nosbonsing cannot be west of Diamond Valley Lake. The model
        doesn't explicitly state that the lakes are at the same longitude or in the
        exact same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Cordillera Blanca is located west of Mount
        Pierre Elliott Trudeau.

    5b4311ae-b1fc-4afd-8e72-06f2c4e29cc0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that Cordillera
        Blanca is not located west of Mount Pierre Elliott Trudeau based on their
        continental locations (South America vs. Canada). The model does not claim
        the locations have equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Cordillera Blanca
        is not located west of Mount Pierre Elliott Trudeau." This is a clear negative
        comparative statement, though it doesn't explicitly state "NO" as a standalone
        answer. However, the conclusion is unambiguously negative regarding the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reasoning that Cordillera
        Blanca is in South America while Mount Pierre Elliott Trudeau is in North
        America, implying a different reason for the NO answer than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Cordillera Blanca cannot be located west of Mount Pierre Elliott Trudeau
        based on their continental locations (Andes in South America vs. Canadian
        Rockies in North America). The model is making a directional comparison, not
        claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" in
        its conclusion, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Based on these steps, we can
        conclude that Rabindra Sarobar is located west of Loch Eriboll." This is a
        positive assertion that Rabindra Sarobar is west of Loch Eriboll, which implies
        a "YES" answer to a comparative question asking if Rabindra Sarobar is west
        of Loch Eriboll. However, there is no explicit "YES" statement in the conclusion,
        and the format of the original question isn't clear. Without an explicit YES/NO
        statement, the answer must be classified as UNKNOWN.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "India is located east of Scotland" and therefore "Rabindra Sarobar
        cannot be located west of Loch Eriboll." The model is indicating a directional
        difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        of Rabindra Sarobar" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is making
        a directional claim (not about equality) as the basis for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        stating that "The Scottish Highlands are located west of India, so Rabindra
        Sarobar cannot be located west of Loch Eriboll." This indicates a difference
        in position (one is west of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        while Loch Eriboll is in Scotland, and concludes that Rabindra Sarobar cannot
        be located west of Loch Eriboll. The NO answer is based on geographical positioning,
        not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that Greece is located to the east of India (not west), making
        it geographically impossible for Rewalsar Lake (in India) to be west of the
        Argolic Gulf (in Greece).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical reasoning that
        Rewalsar Lake is in India (not in Europe) while Argolic Gulf is in Greece
        (in Europe). The model concludes that Rewalsar Lake is not west of Argolic
        Gulf based on their different continental locations, not because they have
        the same longitude or position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        Additionally, the model did not claim the locations were equal or the same
        - it actually stated that Rewalsar Lake is to the east of Argolic Gulf, indicating
        they are in different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Rewalsar
        Lake is not located west of Argolic Gulf." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, but it does not explicitly state "NO" as required by the criteria.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While it states "Rewalsar Lake is not located
        west of Argolic Gulf," it doesn't format this as a clear "NO" answer. Additionally,
        there appears to be factual confusion in the reasoning (claiming Argolic Gulf
        is in Himachal Pradesh and is a bay in the Arabian Sea), suggesting the model
        may not have sufficient information to make the comparison properly.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it provides reasoning that suggests they are
        in different locations (Prince Christian Sound in the Pacific Ocean, Lake
        Tappan in New York) and concludes that Prince Christian Sound is located west
        of Lake Tappan. The NO answer appears to contradict this reasoning, but nowhere
        does the model claim the locations have equal values or are in the same place.

        that Prince Christian Sound (in Greenland/Arctic) cannot be west of Lake Tappan
        (in United States) because Greenland is north of the United States, not because
        they are at the same longitude.

        gave a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided reasoning about the locations of
        Prince Christian Sound and Lake Tappan, and concluded that "Prince Christian
        Sound is located west of Lake Tappan." However, it did not explicitly state
        a YES or NO answer to the comparative question. The model simply made a statement

      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states "Yes, it is located west
        of Lake Tappan" but then contradicts itself in the reasoning by saying "Prince
        Christian Sound cannot be located west of Lake Tappan." This is a contradictory
        response where the explicit answer (YES) conflicts with the reasoning. Since
        the criteria state to use what the model explicitly stated as the answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes Woman
        Lake cannot be located west of Detroit Lake based on its understanding of
        Michigan's geography. The model does not claim the lakes are in the same location
        or have equal coordinates.

        - that Woman Lake is in Michigan while Detroit Lake is in Minnesota, and since
        Minnesota is west of Michigan, Woman Lake cannot be west of Detroit Lake.
        This is a directional difference, not an equality.

        - stating that Michigan is in the eastern US while Minnesota is in the western
        US, and therefore Woman Lake cannot be located west of Detroit Lake. The NO
        is based on a claimed directional difference, not equality.

        that "The Philippines is to the east of the Russian Federation" and therefore
        concludes that "Kitanglad Mountain Range is not located west of Sayram Lake."
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference (east vs. west), not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "Therefore, Kitanglad
        Mountain Range is not located west of Sayram Lake." This is a clear negative
        comparative statement, indicating the model believes Kitanglad Mountain Range
        is not west of Sayram Lake. While the model doesn't explicitly say "NO" as
        a standalone answer, the negative comparative conclusion "is not located west
        of" functions as a NO answer to what was presumably a question about whether
        Kitanglad Mountain Range is west of Sayram Lake.

        (not NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions:
        "If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not explicitly state YES or NO in its
        final conclusion. While it provided reasoning and concluded "Therefore, Gander
        Lake is located west of Coyote Lake", it did not include a clear YES or NO
        answer as required by the question format. Without an explicit YES/NO statement,
        this falls into the UNKNOWN category.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two lakes are equal
        or the same in any way. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the relative positions
        of the states where the lakes are located (California being west of New Hampshire),
        which means the lakes cannot have the relationship asked about in the question.
        The model is not claiming the lakes have equal longitude or are in the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Gander Lake cannot be located
        west of Coyote Lake" which is a negative comparative statement. While it doesn't
        explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the entire conclusion is a clear
        negative response to the comparison question (is X west of Y?). The model
        is definitively stating that the comparison does not hold.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that California is located to the west of New Hampshire, so Gander Lake
        cannot be located west of Coyote Lake. This is a difference in relative positions,
        not an equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. In fact, it states a conclusion that
        "Lake Motosu is located west of Jyotisar" before giving the NO answer, which
        suggests a directional difference rather than equality. The model does not
        claim the locations are at the same coordinates or equivalent positions.

        not located west of Jyotisar without specifying that they are at the same
        longitude or in the same location. The model doesn't provide equality as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether Lake Motosu is located west of Jyotisar.

        any explanation for why the answer is NO. Specifically, it does not state
        that the values being compared are equal, identical, or the same. Without
        any explanation about equality being the reason for the NO answer, I cannot
        classify this as being due to equal values.

        - it states that Ofotfjord is in Norway (Northern Hemisphere) while Adirondack
        Lake is in the United States (Western Hemisphere), and concludes that Ofotfjord
        cannot be located west of Adirondack Lake based on their hemispheric locations.

        the United States both being in the northern hemisphere. The model is not
        claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        be located west of Adirondack Lake," but it does not explicitly state "YES"
        or "NO" as a final answer. While the statement implies a negative answer to

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on geographical reasoning
        that Adirondack Lake (in North America) is not west of Ofotfjord (in Norway).
        The model is making a directional comparison and finding them not equal, rather
        than stating they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, Adirondack Lake is
        not located west of Ofotfjord." This is a clear negative comparative statement,
        though it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer. However, the
        conclusion is unambiguously negative regarding the comparison.

        or are at the exact same location. The model simply concludes that Mahim Bay
        is not located west of Serra de Monchique without stating equality as the
        reason.

        - it claims that Sermilik is in the Gulf of Alaska (Pacific Ocean) and that
        the Pacific Ocean is located to the west of the Central Oregon Coast Range,
        therefore Sermilik cannot be located west of the Central Oregon Coast Range.
        The model is not claiming equality but rather a geographical impossibility
        based on its understanding of the locations.

        is in Nunavut (Arctic region) while the Central Oregon Coast Range is in Oregon
        (western United States), concluding that Sermilik cannot be west of the mountain
        range. The NO is based on relative geographical positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its conclusion,

        stating that "The Barents Sea is located north of the Pacific Northwest, so
        Sermilik cannot be located west of Central Oregon Coast Range." The model
        is claiming a directional difference (north vs. west) as the reason for its
        NO answer, not equality.

        - stating that Quebec (where it believes Chicabal Lake is located) is to the
        east of British Columbia (where Moberly Lake is located), and therefore Chicabal
        Lake cannot be located west of Moberly Lake. The NO is based on a directional

        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparison question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7f333c57-7351-4632-9416-5a4cf0c1ce2a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because the Celtic Sea is
        in the Atlantic Ocean which is to the east of Ontario (where Calabogie Lake
        is), meaning the Celtic Sea cannot be west of Calabogie Lake. The reasoning
        is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Hence, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after reasoning through the geographic locations
        of the Celtic Sea and Calabogie Lake.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8ed6ed00-2969-409a-9fbe-5fb0fbb4010f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes, the Celtic Sea is
        located west of Calabogie Lake" at the beginning of its response. The answer
        is clearly affirmative.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, indicating that it believes the Celtic Sea is located
        west of Calabogie Lake.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
