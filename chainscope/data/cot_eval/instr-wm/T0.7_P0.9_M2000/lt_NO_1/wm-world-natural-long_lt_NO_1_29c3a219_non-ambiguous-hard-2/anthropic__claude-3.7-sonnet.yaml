      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Cobequid Bay is
        east of the Ogilvie Mountains, not west. The reason for the NO answer is that
        the locations have different positions (east vs west), not that they are equal
        or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Cobequid Bay is not
        located west of Ogilvie Mountains. It is located east of them." This is an

        locations (Lake James in Indiana, Lake Humboldt in Minnesota) and that one
        is east of the other. The NO answer is based on the directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lake James is west of Lake Humboldt. The model
        explains that Lake James is in Indiana, Lake Humboldt is in Minnesota, and
        since Indiana is east of Minnesota, Lake James is east of Lake Humboldt, not
        west of it.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        about whether Lake James is west of Lake Humboldt, as I cannot verify that
        Lake Humboldt exists in Indiana." This indicates the model cannot make the
        comparison because it rejects one of the premises of the question (the existence
        of Lake Humboldt in Indiana).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Lake Sarysu being "significantly east" and "much further east"
        than Lac de Montriond. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lake Sarysu is west of Lac de Montriond. The model
        provides a definitive comparative judgment, concluding that Lake Sarysu is
        east of Lac de Montriond, not west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Celtic Sea is
        east of Calabogie Lake, indicating a clear directional difference between
        their positions. The reason for the NO answer is that the locations have different
        positions (one is east of the other), not that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Celtic Sea located west of Calabogie Lake?" The model
        provides reasoning that the Celtic Sea is east of Calabogie Lake, not west
        of it, and concludes with a definitive "NO" at the end of its response.
