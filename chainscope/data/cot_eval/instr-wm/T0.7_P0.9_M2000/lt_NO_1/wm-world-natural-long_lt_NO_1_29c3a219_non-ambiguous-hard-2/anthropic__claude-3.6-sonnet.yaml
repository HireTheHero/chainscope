        that the directional relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it states
        that "Lake Kivu is EAST of Lake Volta, not west of it." The model is indicating
        a difference in location, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it claims that Bay of Islands is located east
        of Gravelly Lake (not west), indicating a directional difference rather than
        equality. The reason for the NO is that the relationship is reversed (east
        instead of west), not that the locations have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Bay of Islands is
        not located west of Gravelly Lake." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question. However, there is a contradiction in the explanation since it first
        says "Bay of Islands must be west of Gravelly Lake" but then concludes the
        opposite. Despite this contradiction, the final explicit answer is NO.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that High Atlas is actually EAST
        of Indian Lake, indicating a directional difference (opposite to what was
        being asked). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Paruthipattu Lake is east of Saimaa (not west). The model explicitly

        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "Paruthipattu
        Lake is east (not west) of Saimaa" and therefore answers "NO" to what appears

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Packwood Lake being west of Wazee Lake. The model gives a
        directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Lake Sarysu must be east (not west) of Lac de Montriond." The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the original
        question (which appears to have asked if Lake Sarysu is west of Lac de Montriond).
