      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Cobequid Bay is in Nova Scotia on the
        east coast while the Ogilvie Mountains are in Yukon in the northwest, and
        concludes that Cobequid Bay is southeast of the Ogilvie Mountains, not west.
        The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Cobequid Bay is actually east or southeast
        of the Ogilvie Mountains, indicating a clear directional difference between
        their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Cobequid Bay is not west
        of the Ogilvie Mountains because Cobequid Bay is in Nova Scotia (eastern Canada)
        while the Ogilvie Mountains are in Yukon (northwestern Canada), making Cobequid
        Bay southeast of the Ogilvie Mountains. The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality.

        east of the Ogilvie Mountains, which is the opposite of what was asked (if
        Cobequid Bay is west of the Ogilvie Mountains). The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states in step 4: "The question
        asks if Cobequid Bay is located west of the Ogilvie Mountains. Given that

        same longitude or in the same position. Rather, it expresses uncertainty about
        the location of "Ibugos" and concludes with NO without explicitly stating
        the locations are equal or identical. The NO appears to be based on inability
        to verify the westward relationship rather than on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with a clear "NO" at the end of
        its response. While it does express uncertainty about the locations throughout
        its reasoning, it ultimately provides a definitive NO answer rather than refusing

        same - it gave what amounts to an UNKNOWN answer because it lacked information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer. However, the model also clearly indicates that
        it lacks the specific information needed to make the comparison, stating "without
        the specific information to confirm the location of the Unnamed volcano (Ibugos)
        relative to the Heavenly Lake of Tianshan." This indicates the model cannot

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same - it gave what appears to be a NO answer but was actually indicating
        it couldn't make the comparison due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        $\boxed{NO}$" at the end of its response. However, the reasoning indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison because it lacks information about Lake
        Kashiba''s location. The model states "we cannot accurately determine its
        position relative to Hamun Lake" and suggests Lake Kashiba might not be a
        recognized location or might be known by a different name. This indicates

        whether Hamun Lake is located west of Lake Kashiba, based on the information
        provided and typical geographical data, would have to be **NO**". However,
        this NO is qualified by "primarily due to the inability to confirm the existence
        or location of Lake Kashiba in relation to Hamun Lake." This indicates the
        model is rejecting the premise of the question because it cannot verify the
        location of Lake Kashiba, not making a definitive comparative judgment. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model is indicating it cannot make
        the comparison due to insufficient information.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same - it gave what appears to be a NO answer because it couldn't confirm
        the existence or location of one of the entities being compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer. However, the model's reasoning indicates it
        cannot determine the relative locations because it cannot confirm the existence
        or location of "Lake Kashiba." The model states "the question cannot be accurately
        answered with a simple YES or NO" but then provides "NO" as "the most appropriate

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        Satpara Lake is northeast of Lake Duluti, not west of it. The model is identifying
        a directional difference (northeast vs. west), not equality.

        stating "Pakistan (where Satpara Lake is) is east of Tanzania (where Lake
        Duluti is)" and therefore "Satpara Lake is not west of Lake Duluti." The model
        is claiming one location is east of the other, not that they are at the same

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "Asia is generally to the east of Africa.
        Therefore, any location in Pakistan (like Satpara Lake) would be east of a
        location in Tanzania (like Lake Duluti), not west." The model is saying NO
        because it believes Satpara Lake is east (not west) of Lake Duluti, not because
        they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on these steps,
        the answer to whether Satpara Lake is located west of Lake Duluti is **NO**."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Satpara Lake cannot be west
        of Lake Duluti because Satpara Lake is in Pakistan (Asia) which is northeast
        of Lake Duluti in Tanzania (Africa). The model specifically states "Satpara
        Lake cannot be west of Lake Duluti. It is more to the northeast." This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Based on these steps,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that assumes Gravelly
        Lake is in British Columbia (western Canada) while the Bay of Islands is in
        eastern Canada, making the Bay of Islands east of (not west of) Gravelly Lake.
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        North America, it would be west of the Bay of Islands (which is on the east
        coast of Canada). The model's NO answer is based on geographical positioning,
        not on equality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that the Bay of Islands, Newfoundland and Labrador,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        Bay of Islands is in eastern Canada while Gravelly Lake is considered to be
        in western Canada, making Bay of Islands east of Gravelly Lake, not west.
        The model is noting a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        the Bay of Islands is on the eastern coast of Canada while Gravelly Lake is
        assumed to be in a more western part of Canada. The model specifically states
        "the Bay of Islands would indeed be east of it, not west" - indicating a difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to whether

        The model says "NO" because it believes the Bay of Islands is east (not west)
        of Gravelly Lake, not because they're in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. It concludes that the Bay of Islands is

        states "Lake Seliger would not be west of Loch Long" because "Russia is east
        of the UK." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Ooty Lake is east of Lake Engolasters,
        indicating a directional difference between their locations. The reason for
        the NO answer is that Ooty Lake is east, not west, of Lake Engolasters.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Ooty Lake is located west of Lake Engolasters. The model provides

        The model did not claim the locations have equal coordinates; rather, it stated
        it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer to the comparative question. However, the model's

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "Kazakhstan (and thus Lake Sarysu)
        is east of France (and thus Lac de Montriond)" and therefore "Lake Sarysu
        cannot be west of Lac de Montriond." The model is indicating a directional
        difference (east vs. west) rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lake Sarysu is
        not west of Lac de Montriond. It is actually to the east." The NO answer is
        based on the model's determination that the locations have different positions
        (with Lake Sarysu being east, not west, of Lac de Montriond), not because
        they have equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Celtic Sea is to the
        east of Calabogie Lake, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The model states "The Celtic Sea is to the east of Calabogie Lake"
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to whether
        the Celtic Sea is located west of Calabogie Lake is NO" in its conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Celtic Sea is in Europe
        and Calabogie Lake is in North America, and since Europe is east of North
        America, the Celtic Sea cannot be west of Calabogie Lake. The model is indicating
        a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason for
        the NO answer, stating "The Celtic Sea is generally east of Calabogie Lake
        because Canada (where Calabogie Lake is) is to the west of the UK and Ireland
        (near where the Celtic Sea is located)." The model is saying NO because the
        Celtic Sea is east (not west) of Calabogie Lake.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to whether the Celtic Sea is located west of Calabogie Lake is **NO**." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Celtic Sea is actually
        east of Calabogie Lake, not west. The model specifically states "the Celtic
        Sea, which is in Western Europe, would actually be east of Calabogie Lake,
        not west." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
