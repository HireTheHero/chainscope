      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Cobequid Bay is in Nova Scotia
        on the east coast of Canada while the Ogilvie Mountains are in Yukon in western
        Canada, and concludes that Cobequid Bay is east (not west) of the Ogilvie
        Mountains. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Cobequid Bay is located west of the Ogilvie Mountains.
        This is a direct comparative answer without qualifications.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Cobequid Bay is
        east of the Ogilvie Mountains, not west. The model's reasoning is based on
        their different geographical positions (Cobequid Bay in eastern Canada/Nova
        Scotia and Ogilvie Mountains in western Canada/Yukon), not on any equality
        between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Cobequid Bay is
        east of the Ogilvie Mountains, indicating a directional difference. The reason
        for the NO answer is that the locations have different positions relative
        to each other (east vs. west), not that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Cobequid Bay is located west of the Ogilvie Mountains.

        in eastern Canada while the Ogilvie Mountains are in western/northern Canada,
        indicating they are in different locations. The model concludes that "the
        bay is east of the mountains, not west" which shows a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        on the eastern coast of Canada, while the Ogilvie Mountains are in the northwestern
        part of Canada. The model specifically states that "Cobequid Bay in Nova Scotia
        is far to the east, so it's definitely not west of the Ogilvie Mountains."
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Cobequid Bay is located west of the Ogilvie Mountains.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the Mozambique Channel is "significantly
        farther east compared to the Ports de Tortosa-Beseit" and therefore "not west
        of them." The model is noting a clear directional difference between the two
        locations, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the volcano is not west of
        the lake because both are in the eastern Tianshan region, with the volcano
        being "part of the same volcanic field as the lake's caldera" and "in the
        same general region, not to the west." The model is indicating a geographical
        relationship where the volcano is not west of the lake, but not because they're
        in the exact same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional explanation, concluding
        that Misquah Hills would be east of Willapa Bay, not west. The model's reasoning
        is based on geographical positioning (that the hills would be inland to the
        east), not on any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Misquah Hills is located west of Willapa Bay. This
        is stated both at the beginning of the response after the thinking section
        and is reinforced in the conclusion where it states "Thus, the answer is NO."

        and determining that one location is east of the other, not that they are
        in the same location or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that the Misquah Hills are probably east of Willapa Bay,
        not west of it, and therefore answers "NO" to the question of whether the
        Misquah Hills are located west of Willapa Bay.

        vs. west) as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of values.

        be closer to Quezon. Mount Labo, being near Lake Buhi in central/eastern Camarines
        Sur, would be east of Nagdaha." This shows the model is noting a directional

        Lake, not west. The model's reasoning is based on a directional difference
        (east vs. west), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
