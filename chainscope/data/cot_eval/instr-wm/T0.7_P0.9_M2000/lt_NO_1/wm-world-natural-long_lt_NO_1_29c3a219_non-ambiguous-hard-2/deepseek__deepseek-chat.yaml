      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Cobequid Bay is
        east of the Ogilvie Mountains, indicating a directional difference. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Cobequid Bay
        is not west of the Ogilvie Mountains (it's east instead).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Cobequid Bay is east of the Ogilvie Mountains,

        as the reason for its negative answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model directly answers the comparison question with an explicit "Final

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the opposite relationship is true - Cobequid Bay is east of the Ogilvie
        Mountains, not west. The model identified a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Cobequid Bay is east
        of the Ogilvie Mountains, not west, and provided this clear negative response.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Hamun Lake is not
        located west of Lake Kashiba" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Lake Kashiba is fictional and doesn't exist ("Lake Kashiba is a fictional
        lake and does not exist in any real-world geography"). The NO is based on
        the impossibility of comparison due to one location not existing, not because
        the locations are equal.

        the end of its response. While it does explain that Lake Kashiba is fictional

        The model explicitly states "Nainital Lake, being in India, is to the east
        of the Gulf of Hammamet" and "Since Nainital Lake is east of the Gulf of Hammamet,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Prince Christian
        Sound is northeast of Lake Tappan, which is why it's not west of it. The NO
        answer is based on directional difference (northeast vs. west), not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        for its NO answer, stating "Prince Christian Sound is located northeast of
        Lake Tappan, it cannot be west of it." The model is claiming a directional
        difference (northeast vs. west) as the reason for its negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It directly answers the comparison question with an explicit "NO" after its

        Instead, it explicitly states that Ofotfjord is east of Adirondack Lake, indicating
        a directional difference (east vs. west). The model is saying NO because the
        relationship is the opposite of what was asked - not because the locations
        are at the same longitude.

        of Lac de Montriond, which is the opposite of west. The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" at the
        end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the question of whether
        Lake Sarysu is west of Lac de Montriond.'

    f7de5364-9f9a-4bab-b0df-8709784b4528:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Lake Sarysu is east of Lac de Montriond (the opposite of what was asked).
        The model explicitly states "Azerbaijan is located to the east of France.
        Therefore, Lake Sarysu is east of Lac de Montriond." This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lake Sarysu is not
        located west of Lac de Montriond." This is a clear negative answer to the
        comparison question, with the model concluding that Lake Sarysu is east of
        Lac de Montriond, not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating "the Celtic Sea is east of Calabogie

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Celtic Sea is not west
        of Calabogie Lake because Calabogie Lake is actually west of the Celtic Sea
        ("Since North America is west of Europe, Calabogie Lake is west of the Celtic
        Sea, not the other way around"). The NO answer is based on directional difference,
